13	Imagine if a Christian politician said this of a mosque burningÃ¢â¬Â¦. Muslim Politician in Canada Says Notre Dame Fire Was Ã¢â¬ÅDivine Intervention Payback for France banning the Islamic veil. By Paul Joseph Watson, Summit News, April 17,2019: A Muslim politician in Canada wrote a Facebook post in which she said that the Notre Dame fire was Ã¢â¬Ådivine interventionÃ¢â¬Â in response to France banning the Islamic veil. QuÃÂ©bec Solidaire member Eve Torres suggested that the tragedy was Ã¢â¬Åa result of a divine intervention related to the prohibition of religious symbols in France,Ã¢â¬Â according to LaPresse.ca. France passed an act of parliament in 2010 which banned the wearing of face-covering headgear in public places, including the Muslim niqab and burka. Torres said that the ban had provoked the Ã¢â¬ÅwrathÃ¢â¬Â of Allah and Ã¢â¬Åhere is the result!Ã¢â¬Â She further added, Ã¢â¬ÅI would sleep firefighters at the basilica of Notre-Dame Street in Montreal,Ã¢â¬Â suggesting that could be the next church to go up in flames. The co-spokesperson of Quebec Solidaire, Manon MassÃÂ©, said she was Ã¢â¬Åvery disturbedÃ¢â¬Â by the comments and that they were in Ã¢â¬Åvery bad tasteÃ¢â¬Â. Torres later apologized, claiming it was all just a Ã¢â¬ÅjokeÃ¢â¬Â. BuzzFeed and other media outlets have attempted to portray Muslims celebrating or justifying the fire as a Ã¢â¬Åconspiracy theoryÃ¢â¬Â.	1
14	"""by Richard Haney, Executive Director. On Monday afternoon, I got a notification on my phone from the BBC that Notre Dame was on fire. What a tragedy. The evening TV newscast showed the horrific scene of smoke, fire and ashes in Paris. Ive visited the cathedral on two occasions; I can hardly imagine it damaged or destroyed.. Notre Dame means our lady, and newscasters have often referred to her in their reports. Yet I imagine few people outside the Catholic Church realize that our lady is a reference to Mary, the mother of Jesus.. A day later, I was still thinking about the wounds of this great lady. Much of the cathedral still stands though the roof and spire fell. How much of the magnificent buildings art and decorated interiors remain has yet to be determined. In a symbolic sense, is Mary, our Lords mother, weeping again?. Imagine how Jesus mother must have been wounded and pained to watch and hear of her sons suffering and death. It is Holy Week, after all, and the fanfare of waving palms and shouting hosanna has given way to the story of Jesus cleansing the temple. A confrontation with religious leaders looms like storm clouds on the horizon.. As the weeks events unfold, Jesus celebrates a final meal with His disciples. He washes their feet. He retreats to the Garden of Gethsemane. He prays while the disciples sleep. He sweats drops of blood. Then in quick succession: betrayal, arrest, a mock trial, scourging and a crown of thorns. Finally, the agony of deathdeath on a cross. And Mary was weeping for her son.. Yes, I know. Easter is coming. We live in the post-resurrection reality, and that brightness keeps the darkness from overwhelming us. But dont move too quickly to Resurrection Sunday. First, remember Maundy Thursday and learn from Jesus the servant who stooped to love His disciples and died forgiving His enemies. And dont skip over Good Friday. It isnt labeled good because the experience of torture and death is in any way pleasant. It is the good results of atonement for sin and forgiven sinners that invoke the adjective. But such love came at great sacrifice, and Marys heart was broken.. On Sunday I will join Christians around the world celebrating the miracle of the resurrection. It wouldnt surprise me to hear of a throng gathered outside Notre Dame to bear witness to life after death through Christ. But until then, I will meditate on our Lords suffering and remember Marys tears.. The music of Bachs Saint Matthews Passion and Handels Messiah often ushers me into a place of quiet reflection and remembrance. A lesser-known favorite is Polish composer Henryk Greckis Symphony of Sorrowful Songs. The works second movement uses the words of a teenage girl, Helena Blazusiakwna, which she wrote on the wall of a Gestapo prison cell as she prayed for protection and deliverance.. Isaiah 53:5 reminds us: he was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by his bruises we are healed.. Let us first weep with Mary as we remember Jesus costly death, and let us prepare to receive the culmination of the Good News that brings healing and wholeness to a world awaiting redemption.. Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting? (1 Corinthians 15:55).. He is risen.. He is risen indeed.. Hallelujah!"""	0

32	It reminds us that we are greater than our brief mortal lives and the petty pursuits that fill it' As people in Paris and around the world watched in horror as flames consumed the roof of Notre Dame Cathedral, the blaze also stirred genuine emotions that could come only from witnessing the loss of beauty, art historian Elizabeth Lev said. The April 15 fire that engulfed the centuries-old Gothic cathedral showed that although Notre Dame was a formidable structure, it was Ã¢â¬Åvulnerable at the same time, much like Our Lady at the foot of the cross,Ã¢â¬Â Lev told Catholic News Service. Ã¢â¬ÅPeople saw a thing of beauty Ã¢â¬â universally recognized beauty Ã¢â¬â hovering on the brink of destruction and realized that beauty does matter to us after all,Ã¢â¬Â she said. Up to 500 firefighters battled for 15 hours to save the cathedral after flames erupted in the structureÃ¢â¬â¢s attic. The blaze quickly consumed two-thirds of the 13th-century oak roof and brought down the cathedralÃ¢â¬â¢s 300-foot spire. Authorities said much of the cathedralÃ¢â¬â¢s wooden interior was destroyed and its masonry was seriously scorched. Lev told CNS that as a child, she admired the stunning edifice from afar and when dreaming of moving to Europe, Ã¢â¬ÅI imagined it would be the backdrop to my life.Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅI studied it, then went to see it and, a few years ago, I started lecturing on it. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve gone to Mass there and venerated the crown of thorns. It was like having a pen pal, then becoming friends but then being abruptly and brutally separated,Ã¢â¬Â she said. Regarded as a crown jewel of medieval Gothic architecture, Notre Dame Cathedral stands Ã¢â¬Åin the geographical centre of the cityÃ¢â¬Â and bore witness to major events, including the Reformation, the French Revolution, the Paris Riots and the Nazi occupation of France during World War II, Lev explained. Ã¢â¬ÅIt has welcomed kings and popes, saints and sinners, as the Ã¢â¬Ëhouse of God and the abode of men,'Ã¢â¬Â she said. Ã¢â¬ÅIt is a symbol of the enduring presence of faith, despite every kind of onslaught.Ã¢â¬Â Much like the great pyramids of Giza or the Pantheon in Rome, Lev said, Notre Dame Cathedral stood as a testament to how humanity can Ã¢â¬Åcreate astonishing thingsÃ¢â¬Â when people Ã¢â¬Ådirect their ingenuity to something outside themselves.Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅIt reminds us that we are greater than our brief mortal lives and the petty pursuits that fill it,Ã¢â¬Â she said. Ã¢â¬ÅBut when human beings dedicate themselves to the divine, the transcendent, the experience of God redeeming creation, they can make something sublime.Ã¢â¬Â	0

EveryoneÃ¢â¬â¢s so sad.Ã¢â¬Â Around 400 firefighters battled the blaze at the more than 800-year-old church. While the spire and the oak wood roof were destroyed, the two bell towers and the front facade were saved. Also saved were some of the most precious religious artifacts, including the holy crown that many believe is from the crown of thorns Jesus Christ wore at his crucifixion. French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed that they would rebuild Notre Dame, and will be launching an international fundraiser. That message of hope is what rang out louder than the flames.

97	Last night the world was shocked by images of one of the greatest buildings in the world ablaze. Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris caught fire during renovation work. It is 850 years old and has been at the centre of French and European culture for all that time. Irreplaceable treasures have been lost. Incomparably beautiful artwork has been destroyed. The ancient roof, a work of art in itself, has been consumed. The nation is in mourning. One bishop said he Ã¢â¬Ëscreamed with horrorÃ¢â¬â¢ when he saw what was happening. In 586 BC, SolomonÃ¢â¬â¢s Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by the armies of King Nebuchadnezzar Ã¢â¬â an even more shattering blow. The prophet Isaiah wrote: Ã¢â¬ËOur holy and glorious temple, where our ancestors praised you, has been burned with fire, and all that we treasured lies in ruinsÃ¢â¬â¢ (Isaiah 64.11). That is what the people of France have woken up to this morning. Notre Dame has not, unlike the temple, been totally destroyed: the stone walls are still standing. The French government has promised to rebuild it, and thoughts will soon turn to how this can be done. But everyone is aware that too much has been lost for it ever to be the same again, and everyone is grieving. The Bible sometimes bears witness to terrible things. But it also speaks a message of hope: in just the next chapter of Isaiah, we read of a new creation. Ã¢â¬ËBe glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joyÃ¢â¬â¢ God says (Isaiah 65.18). When EnglandÃ¢â¬â¢s Old St PaulÃ¢â¬â¢s Cathedral was destroyed in the 1666 Fire of London, a stone was found in the ruins bearing a single word from a Latin inscription: Ã¢â¬ËResurgamÃ¢â¬â¢. It means Ã¢â¬ËI shall rise againÃ¢â¬â¢, and was taken as an emblem of hope. Perhaps the most extraordinary image from the cathedral appears to show a heap of debris still glowing from the fire. Behind it, shining gold, is a cross. Perhaps itÃ¢â¬â¢s too soon for the French people to be hopeful. But we should all pray that Notre Dame will be rebuilt to the glory of God Ã¢â¬â because as well as being a great monument to human civilisation, it is first of all a place of worship.	0

123	Imagine if a Christian politician said this of a mosque burningÃ¢â¬Â¦. Muslim Politician in Canada Says Notre Dame Fire Was Ã¢â¬ÅDivine Intervention. Payback for France banning the Islamic veil. By Paul Joseph Watson, Summit News, April 17,2019: A Muslim politician in Canada wrote a Facebook post in which she said that the Notre Dame fire was Ã¢â¬Ådivine interventionÃ¢â¬Â in response to France banning the Islamic veil. QuÃÂ©bec Solidaire member Eve Torres suggested that the tragedy was Ã¢â¬Åa result of a divine intervention related to the prohibition of religious symbols in France,Ã¢â¬Â according to LaPresse.ca. France passed an act of parliament in 2010 which banned the wearing of face-covering headgear in public places, including the Muslim niqab and burka. Torres said that the ban had provoked the Ã¢â¬ÅwrathÃ¢â¬Â of Allah and Ã¢â¬Åhere is the result!Ã¢â¬Â She further added, Ã¢â¬ÅI would sleep firefighters at the basilica of Notre-Dame Street in Montreal,Ã¢â¬Â suggesting that could be the next church to go up in flames. The co-spokesperson of Quebec Solidaire, Manon MassÃÂ©, said she was Ã¢â¬Åvery disturbedÃ¢â¬Â by the comments and that they were in Ã¢â¬Åvery bad tasteÃ¢â¬Â. Torres later apologized, claiming it was all just a Ã¢â¬ÅjokeÃ¢â¬Â. BuzzFeed and other media outlets have attempted to portray Muslims celebrating or justifying the fire as a Ã¢â¬Åconspiracy theoryÃ¢â¬Â.	1

195	PARIS -- A criminal terrorist investigation has been opened in Paris following the discovery of a car parked near Notre Dame Cathedral with seven gas canisters and pages written in Arabic inside, prosecutors said. The Paris prosecutorâs office revealed Wednesday that a couple it described as radicalized - a 34-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman - was arrested a day earlier and transferred to Paris to be questioned in the case. The car found near the famous cathedral on Sunday morning had its license plates removed and hazard lights on. That evening, its owner went to the police to report that his radicalized daughter was missing but without saying his car had also disappeared, the prosecutorâs office said. Police briefly detained and questioned the car owner before letting him go, the prosecutorâs office said. His daughter still is being sought, the office said. Officials told the Reuters news agency that the 19-year-old woman was known to police for wanting to go to Syria. The man and woman arrested in a highway rest area near the southern town of Orange on Tuesday already were known by French security services for their alleged links with âradical Islamism,â prosecutors said. The prosecutorâs office would not say why investigators suspect them in the case nor whether the couple might have been in contact with the car ownerâs daughter. The papers written in Arabic are being analyzed, the prosecutorâs office said. It said it has opened an investigation under suspicion of a âcriminal terrorist association.â Two other officials, speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity since the investigation is ongoing, said an employee of a bar near Notre Dame Cathedral flagged the car Sunday morning as it was parked along the Seine River. No one was inside, but police found six canisters filled with gas in the trunk and an empty canister on one of the seats. No detonator or ignition materials were found in the car, the prosecutorâs office said. In addition to the car owner, three other people were briefly detained and questioned in the case before being released, it said. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said it still was not clear why the car was abandoned or what the alleged intentions were of those under arrest. Cazeneuve said there have been 260 arrests linked to extremist networks since the beginning of the year âand a significant number of these people were preparing attacks.â France hit by another deadly terrorist attack. In an interview with Le Monde newspaper earlier this week, Paris prosecutor FranÃ§ois Molins said an increasing number of teenage girls have been radicalized, with âvery worrying profiles,â ââvery harsh personalitiesâ and âsometimes terrorist plans that, intellectually, start to be brought to completion.â Molins said 35 minors - 23 boys and 12 girls - are being investigated under preliminary charges, nine of whom have been detained. France is on alert after a deadly string of attacks by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and threats against landmarks. Algeria-linked extremists used gas canisters filled with nails during attacks on Paris in the 1990s.	1

It had been feared that both religious artefacts would be lost to the raging fire which engulfed the iconic building. âFather Fournier is an absolute hero,â a member of the emergency services said. âHe showed no fear at all as he made straight for the relics inside the cathedral, and made sure they were saved.

I mean, this church was there for more than 850 years, even the Nazis didnât dare to destroy it.â Karsenty then explained the routine Islamic attacks against churches throughout France, and alluded that the media is spreading the âpolitically correctâ narrative that the cathedralâs burning is accidental before being suddenly cut off by Smith. âAnd you need to know that for the past year weâve had churches desecrated each and every week in France. All over France. Of course you will hear the stories about the political correctness which will tell you that itâs probably an accident â â âSir? Sir. Sir. Weâre not going to speculate here of the cause of something which we donât know,â Smith said. âIâm just telling you something, we need to be ready â â Karsenty began. âNo sir. Weâre not doing that here. Not now, not on my watch,â Smith snapped.

289	"""Over the years, Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris has survived everything from the French Revolution to the Black Plague (which killed tens of millions of Europeans in the 1340s/1350s) to two world warsand on Monday, April 15, Parisians were shocked to see the historic Medieval building in flames. But the blaze has been extinguished, although Notre Dame suffered extensive damage and will need to be rebuilt. According to French authorities, there is no reason to suspect foul play; the blaze appeared to be the accidental result of renovations worknot terrorism or arson. But that hasnt stopped far-right extremists and wingnuts from floating conspiracy theories about the Notre Dame fire.. ADVERTISEMENT. One such extremist is Glenn Beck, founder of the right-wing media company Blaze TV and former AM talk radio host. On Blaze, Beck described the fire as a French equivalent of 9/11 and speculated that the Notre Dame blaze might have been started on purpose by Islamic terroristsdespite the lack of evidence of any type of foul play.. Blaze asserted, If this was arson, this is going to be bad. It might have just been started by a cigarette; we dont know. But if this was started by Islamists, I dont think youll find out about it, because I think it would set the entire country on fire. Theyve had killings, theyve had mass shootings, theyve had people running people down in the streets. The tension is very high.. The French government, according to Beck, will not notify the public if it finds evidence of terrorism. This is their World Trade Center moment, Beck said on Blaze TV. And if this was done by terrorists, I think that they will keep it quiet.. Guest Chad Robichaux concurred with Beck, telling him, Im with you and claiming that French authorities will cover up any evidence of foul play because there would be a slaughter in the streets in France.. Becks 9/11 comparison is flawed. First, there is no question that the al-Qaeda attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001 were attacks of terrorism. The Twin Towers were destroyed on purpose; the Notre Dame blaze, French authorities are saying, was an accident. Second, no one died because of the Notre Dame fire, although one firefighter suffered serious injurieswhereas on 9/11, roughly 3000 people were murdered.. ADVERTISEMENT. When far-right French politician Philippe Karsenty was interviewed on Fox News on Monday, he speculated that the Notre Dame blaze was set on purpose and that the French government would suppress evidence of foul play. Karsenty told Fox News Shepard Smith, Even if nobody died, its like a 9/11. Its a French 9/11, you know?. Of course, you will hear the story of the political correctness, which will tell you its probably an accident.. But Smith, who is among the more reasonable conservatives at Fox News, shut Karsenty downtelling him, Sir, were not going to speculate here of the cause of something which we dont know. Were not doing that herenot now, not on my watch.. Alex Jones Infowars website, notorious for promoting outlandish conspiracy theories, also floated the claim that the fire was deliberately set. Infowars source was an alleged Notre Dame worker. And anti-Islam activist Pamela Geller claimed that the Notre Dame Cathedral inferno was intentionally set and implied that there was an ISIS (Islamic State, Iraq and Syria) connection.. ADVERTISEMENT. A troll Twitter account, @CNNPolitics2020, pretended to be CNN and posted, BREAKING: CNN can now confirm the Notre Dame fire was caused by act of terrorism. But the account had no connection whatsoever to CNN, and Twitter shut @CNNPolitics2020 down when it learned of the disinformation it was spreading about the Notre Dame blaze."""	1

328	Payback for France banning the Islamic veil. A Muslim politician in Canada wrote a Facebook post in which she said that the Notre Dame fire was Ã¢â¬Ådivine interventionÃ¢â¬Â in response to France banning the Islamic veil. QuÃÂ©bec Solidaire member Eve Torres suggested that the tragedy was Ã¢â¬Åa result of a divine intervention related to the prohibition of religious symbols in France,Ã¢â¬Â according to LaPresse.ca. France passed an act of parliament in 2010 which banned the wearing of face-covering headgear in public places, including the Muslim niqab and burka. Torres said that the ban had provoked the Ã¢â¬ÅwrathÃ¢â¬Â of Allah and Ã¢â¬Åhere is the result!Ã¢â¬Â She further added, Ã¢â¬ÅI would sleep firefighters at the basilica of Notre-Dame Street in Montreal,Ã¢â¬Â suggesting that could be the next church to go up in flames. The co-spokesperson of Quebec Solidaire, Manon MassÃÂ©, said she was Ã¢â¬Åvery disturbedÃ¢â¬Â by the comments and that they were in Ã¢â¬Åvery bad tasteÃ¢â¬Â. Torres later apologized, claiming it was all just a Ã¢â¬ÅjokeÃ¢â¬Â. BuzzFeed and other media outlets have attempted to portray Muslims celebrating or justifying the fire as a Ã¢â¬Åconspiracy theoryÃ¢â¬Â. The reality is the exact opposite, as the video below documents. Source: by Paul Joseph Watson | InfoWars	1

ADVERTISEMENT âThat was a decision made within hours. It sounds like a different kind of decision. Perhaps a political decision rather than one based on careful investigation of the facts,â Dobbs said on his show. The fire is still being investigated. Dobbs pointed to a statistic that hundreds of Catholic churches in France were vandalized last year alone, saying the figures provided âcontext"""" to the fire at Notre Dame. """"This is not speculation,"""" Dobbs said. âThis is the situation right now in France, and the recent history of what has happened to Catholic churches throughout the nation, ignored too often by some covering the tragedy, some who have ruled out speculation about the cause of the Notre Dame fire."""" The Hill has reached out to Fox Business Network for comment. Conspiracy theories about the cause of the Monday blaze quickly took off on social media.

385	Payback for France banning the Islamic veil. Paul Joseph Watson. PrisonPlanet.com. April 17, 2019. A Muslim politician in Canada wrote a Facebook post in which she said that the Notre Dame fire was Ã¢â¬Ådivine interventionÃ¢â¬Â in response to France banning the Islamic veil. QuÃÂ©bec Solidaire member Eve Torres suggested that the tragedy was Ã¢â¬Åa result of a divine intervention related to the prohibition of religious symbols in France,Ã¢â¬Â according to LaPresse.ca. France passed an act of parliament in 2010 which banned the wearing of face-covering headgear in public places, including the Muslim niqab and burka. Torres said that the ban had provoked the Ã¢â¬ÅwrathÃ¢â¬Â of Allah and Ã¢â¬Åhere is the result!Ã¢â¬Â She further added, Ã¢â¬ÅI would sleep firefighters at the basilica of Notre-Dame Street in Montreal,Ã¢â¬Â suggesting that could be the next church to go up in flames. The co-spokesperson of Quebec Solidaire, Manon MassÃÂ©, said she was Ã¢â¬Åvery disturbedÃ¢â¬Â by the comments and that they were in Ã¢â¬Åvery bad tasteÃ¢â¬Â. Torres later apologized, claiming it was all just a Ã¢â¬ÅjokeÃ¢â¬Â. BuzzFeed and other media outlets have attempted to portray Muslims celebrating or justifying the fire as a Ã¢â¬Åconspiracy theoryÃ¢â¬Â. The reality is the exact opposite, as the video below documents. Source: Muslim Politician in Canada Says Notre Dame Fire Was Ã¢â¬ÅDivine InterventionÃ¢â¬Â	1

However, Eve Torres likely knows that the Quran says that Allah will punish the unbelievers by the hands of the Muslims (9:14), and so there is an implicit invitation to Muslims to attack the Quebec church.

411	"""Even after the Notre Dame fire was declared accidental, figures on the far-right took to the internet to blame Muslims and claim it's symbolic of Paris becoming an 'Islamic toilet'.

The fire engulfed the roof of the famed cathedral in central Paris on Monday evening, sending flames and huge clouds of grey smoke billowing into the sky and causing its spire to collapse. At the time, a spokesman for the cathedral said that the wooden structure supporting the roof was being gutted by the blaze, with fire service adding the blaze could be """"potentially linked"""" to ongoing renovations. Despite the almost immediate ruling out of the fire being the result of an attack, alt-right figures used the inferno as their way to sprout hate against Muslim -- even days later.

Meanwhile, according to Newsweek, some French officials say they Ã¢â¬ÅdonÃ¢â¬â¢t know whyÃ¢â¬Â the churches have been targeted. While the cause of the Notre Dame inferno is still unknown, one hypothesis is Islamic arson, but MSM is stopping anyone who dares mention this from speaking out. For example, Fox NewsÃ¢â¬â¢ Shepard Smith and Neil Cavuto both cut off guests who alluded to the possibility of the fire being intentional. A TIME Magazine columnist, Christopher J.

447	Friends, This week is Holy Week, when millions of Christians mark the death and resurrection of Jesus. Under normal circumstances, Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris would have been preparing to display its holy relics to the faithful on Good Friday. Instead, it has burned. And while the fire at the Cathedral is now extinguished, it has left behind a smoldering hole in the heart of Paris. After a nine-hour battle, firefighters managed to save Notre DameÃ¢â¬â¢s famed faÃÂ§ade and towers, and many invaluable works of art. But Notre Dame was not just architecturally and artistically beautifulÃ¢â¬âit is also a sacred space of worship. Its place in Catholicism is undisputed, as is its role in French history. The nearly 900-year-old-cathedral survived plagues, the French revolution and the Nazi occupation, and continues to attract over 30,000 visitors a day of all nationalities and religions. Our hearts are with the people of Paris and all worshippers who know the sorrow of losing their sacred spaces. Yet, Notre Dame has survived decay and destruction before, and the bells will toll again Ã¢â¬â maybe not on this Easter. But soon. So to those who celebrate, may this Easter be filled with hope, love and those who matter to you. Joyce S. Dubensky	0

It has twice been my privilege to visit and especially to celebrate Mass there. What impressed me, along with the great beauty that was intended to draw our hearts to God, was the faith of the French people who brought that vision to life. May God be with them and comfort them. âThe fact that this happened during Holy Week should remind us that God restores life from the ashes.

498	"""Was the fire inside Notre Dame caused by Islamic terrorists? Conservative media personality Glenn Beck speculated on Tuesday that the fire may have been intentionally started Ã¢â¬â and that the alleged attack would be as important to France as the 9/11 radical Islamic terror attacks were to America. Sponsored: Economist Warns: Gold Will Plummet to $700 Ã¢â¬ÅThis is their 9/11,Ã¢â¬Â Beck said on his Blaze Media show. Ã¢â¬ÅThis is a world landmark and probably, next to the Eiffel Tower, the most iconic building in all of France, and more important than the Eiffel Tower.Ã¢â¬Â Beck suggested that Ã¢â¬ÅIslamistsÃ¢â¬Â may have been behind the fire that almost completely destroyed the 800-year-old Catholic cathedral. Ã¢â¬ÅIt might have just been started by a cigarette, we donÃ¢â¬â¢t know,Ã¢â¬Â Beck said. Ã¢â¬ÅBut if this was started by Islamists, I donÃ¢â¬â¢t think youÃ¢â¬â¢ll find out about it, because I think it would set the entire country on fire.Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅTheyÃ¢â¬â¢ve had killings, theyÃ¢â¬â¢ve had mass shootings, theyÃ¢â¬â¢ve had people running people down in the streets Ã¢â¬â the tension is very high. This is their World Trade Center moment,Ã¢â¬Â he said. Ã¢â¬ÅAnd if this was done by terrorists, I think that they will keep it quiet.Ã¢â¬Â French officials have denied that arson is to blame. Officials suspect the fires were accidentally set during restoration work. Beck himself later clarified his comments and asked social media users not to politicize them. Sponsored: Shocking Object Found Inside Maryland Woman But Beck wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t the only conservative media personality asking questions. Fox News host Lou Dobbs said Tuesday that French authorities are still investigating the cause of the blaze, and called the decision by officials to rule out terrorism or arson a Ã¢â¬Åpolitical decision.Ã¢â¬Â 875 Catholic churches had been vandalized in France since 2018, Dobbs said. He suggested authorities Ã¢â¬Åperhaps overlookedÃ¢â¬Â the fact that one church in Paris was even set on fire just weeks ago. Ã¢â¬ÅThis is context Ã¢â¬â this is not speculation Ã¢â¬â this is the situation right now in France,Ã¢â¬Â Dobbs said. Ã¢â¬ÅAnd the recent history of what has happened to Catholic churches throughout the nation.Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅIgnored too often by some covering the tragedy, some who have ruled out speculation about the cause of the Notre Dame fire as they speculate Ã¢â¬â taking it as gospel that, well, arson was not the cause Ã¢â¬â was a decision that was made it just hours,Ã¢â¬Â Dobbs said. Sponsored: Most Shocking Biblical Event of 2019 Not everyone agrees.

506	Since France has been the center of Western perfumery for several centuries, and so many major fragrance houses have been based in Paris, itÃ¢â¬â¢s no surprise that Paris landmarks Ã¢â¬â including the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris Ã¢â¬â make cameo appearances in so many perfume advertisements. Earlier today, Notre-Dame was engulfed in flames. The cause of the fire hasnÃ¢â¬â¢t been established yet. While weÃ¢â¬â¢re reflecting on this event, letÃ¢â¬â¢s take a break from the news footage of the conflagration and look back at a few images of Notre-Dame in fragrance adsÃ¢â¬Â¦ This focus of the above 1954 advertisement for Bourjois Soir de Paris (Evening in Paris) is the couple elegantly dressed in evening-wear (plus that perfume bottle!), but the location is established by the view of Notre-Dame across the Seine. That concept is still very persuasive in this 1985 ad for Lanvin ArpÃÂ¨ge. This photograph pulls back further to include a couple dancing on a Left Bank quai, the Seine itself, the Pont de lÃ¢â¬â¢ArchevÃÂªchÃÂ©, and a spotlit Notre-Dame. This illustrated ad for DÃ¢â¬â¢Orsay Intoxication reportedly dates to 1946 (although it looks more like to 1964, to my eye? ) and has a stylized, dreamlike appearance. An almost ghostly white sketch of the cathedral seems to float just behind the square. The couple may have just purchased their little bouquet from the flower-seller in the background. Speaking of floral arrangements, in this illustration from 1945, an ad for Plassard Bouquet de Paris, Notre-Dame is clustered with other Paris landmarksÃ¢â¬âthe Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, the Basilica of SacrÃÂ©-CÃâur in MontmartreÃ¢â¬âin a tricolore nosegay. What else is there to say? Notre-Dame has been inspiring people for so many reasons since it was constructed eight centuries ago. LetÃ¢â¬â¢s hope that it can continue doing so.	0

GellerReport.com April 18, 2019 Yesterday the Geller Report brought you the news of the Quebec Muslim politician Eve Torres, who said of the Notre Dame fire that Allah had caused it because of Franceâs burqa ban: âTorres said that the ban had provoked the âwrathâ of Allah and âhere is the result!ââ She also issued an implicit threat: âI would sleep firefighters at the basilica of Notre-Dame Street in Montreal.â Now it comes to light that she is a former employee of CAIRâs Canada offshoot, the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM). A Geller Report reader writes: Hello Pamela, RE: https://gellerreport.com/2019/04/notre-dame-wrath-of-allah.html/ Eve Torres was Quebec coordinator for NCCM/CAIR-Canada Before joining the Marxist QuÃ©bec solidaire political party, Eve Torres was Quebecâs coordinator for NCCM/CAIR-Canada. This article provides info about Torresâ involvement with CAIR. The Restâ¦HERE	1

But then again, you are just bland hack that probably would want the Notre Dame to be torn down and replaced with an LGBT museum. #NotreDame https://twitter.com/letsgomathias/status/1117842007353905156	1

545	"""A major fire has engulfed the medieval cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, one of FranceÃ¢â¬â¢s most famous landmarks. The officials say that the fire broke out during a work of renovation. More than 500 firefighters worked day and night to preserve the structure while Christain evangelists slipped into depression after failing to extinguish Notre Dame fire with their superpowers. Many of these evangelists had earlier claimed to kinetically solve any damn problem in the world without even knowing the problem. One of the evangelists spoke to The Fauxy and said Ã¢â¬ÅI am surprised, itÃ¢â¬â¢s the first time my superpower hasnÃ¢â¬â¢t worked. I have solved so many problems for so many Christ-lovers. One woman who was not staying with her husband wanted to have kids. I got it done! I think Notre Dame is cursed and no one can save it.Ã¢â¬Â Another evangelist claimed that it was due to his superpowers that the Notre Dame cathedral caught fire; he was arrested later. While in custody, the arrested evangelist revealed that he was just bluffing like other evangelists do, however it turned out that the policeman who caught him subscribed to the Left-ideology, and could not believe that Christain missionaries can be frauds."""	1

550	Prince Philip and I have been deeply saddened to see the images of the fire which has engulfed Notre-Dame Cathedral.. I extend my sincere admiration to the emergency services who have risked their lives to try to save this important national monument.. My thoughts and prayers are with those who worship at the Cathedral and all of France at this difficult time.. A French priest who helped comfort the wounded after the worst terrorist attack on Paris this century has emerged as the hero of the Notre-Dame fire.. Jean-Marc Fournier, chaplain of the Paris Fire Brigade, saved the Blessed Sacrament and the Crown of Thorns from the burning cathedral on Monday night when he bravely went in with firefighters.. It had been feared that both religious artefacts would be lost to the raging fire which engulfed the iconic building.. Father Fournier is an absolute hero, a member of the emergency services said.. He showed no fear at all as he made straight for the relics inside the cathedral, and made sure they were saved. He deals with life and death every day, and shows no fear..
