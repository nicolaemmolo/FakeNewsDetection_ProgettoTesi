0	Muhammad permitted lying (Sahih Muslim 6303, Bukhari 49:857). Jesus, ÂThou shalt not bear false witness.Â Matt. 19:18. Muhammad, owned and traded slaves. (Sahih Muslim 3901) Jesus freed the slaves of sin and freed them from sickness & bondages. Christ is your saviour and came to give you life. Muhammed misleads you to hell.	1
1	And one of His signs is that He created for you spouses from among yourselves so that you may find comfort in them. And He has placed between you compassion and mercy. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.	0
2	She reported God's Messenger as saying, The best of you is he who is best to his family, and I am the best among you to my family. When one of you dies speak no ill of him.	0
3	Sahl bin Hunaif and Qais bin Sad were sitting in the city of Al-Qadisiya. A funeral procession passed in front of them and they stood up. They were told that funeral procession was of one of the inhabitants of the land i.e. of a non-believer, under the protection of Muslims. They said, A funeral procession passed in front of the Prophet and he stood up. When he was told that it was the coffin of a Jew, he said, Is it not a living being (soul)?	0
4	It should be noted that in the long history of Muslim people, there were times when such conditions and rules were adhered to and other times where there were violations to differing degrees. There have also been some misinterpretations of the concept by some scholars, possibly influenced at least in part, by the circumstances of the time in which they lived. The fact remains, however, that Islamic teachings should not be driven either by what some Muslims did in the past or are doing today or by misinterpretations from the past or present.	0
5	The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Three do not ask about them: a man who left the congregation and disobeyed his imam and died in disobedience, a slave woman or slave who escaped from his master and died, and a woman whose husband was absent from her and who was sufficient for her worldly needs, so she made herself visible after him; Do not ask about them.	0
6	And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): ÂWorship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghut (all false deities, etc. i.e. do not worship Taghut besides Allah).Â Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied (the truth)	0
7	"Tawheed is derived from sura Ikhlas which tells the Muslims that their god (Allah) is ONE ""Sura 112:1  Qul huwa Allahu ahad(un)"", this statement was stolen from the Bible by Muhammed (plagiarism). The problem is that muhammed/Allah either was ignorant of the meaning or was just being deceitful. The word ahad as in my previous post I explained it meant a unification of two or more! In short ahad LITTERALLY means ONE OF. Water is AHAD (2 parts Hydrogen+Oxygen) human beings are ahad (spirit+soul+body). What is interesting is that, it seems Allah forgot in THIS SPECIFIC verse that He shouldn't have used ahad but instead used WAHID which is the actual name for 'one' in ARABIC! what is worse is we know Allah knows this because he uses the correct word 'WAHID' in OTHER verses to denote 'ONE'! In addition, When you ask any Muslim they always say that Allah is BEYOND human comprehension.. The thought of Allah being in his creation will be synonymous to committing shirk. Muslims are taught that one of the principles of tawheed is that ALLAH IS NEVER IN HIS CREATION HE IS BEYOND IT, the problem is that their theology doesn't match with what is in the Quran nor hadiths."	1
8	"The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""I advise you to treat women kindly, for the woman was created from a rib, and the most crooked part of the rib is its uppermost part. If you try to straighten it, you will break it; and if you leave it, it will remain crooked. So, treat women kindly."	0
9	This is how people get terrified when they see the real Islam of Muhammed is coming to their neighbourhood in any moment! Think how many people have went through this moment in many different places in the last 1400 years!	1
10	"And wish not for the things in which Allah has made some of you to excel others). (For men there is reward for what they have earned, (and likewise) for women there is reward for what they have earned,) indicates, according to Ibn Jarir, that each person will earn his wages for his works, a reward if his deeds are good, and punishment if his deeds are evil. It was also reported that this Ayah is talking about inheritance, indicating the fact that each person will get his due share of the inheritance, as Al-Walibi reported from Ibn `Abbas. Allah then directed the servants to what benefits them, (and ask Allah of His Bounty.)Therefore, the Ayah states, ""Do not wish for what other people were endowed with over you, for this is a decision that will come to pass, and wishing does not change its decree. However, ask Me of My favor and I will grant it to you, for I Am Most Generous and Most Giving.'' Allah then said, (Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knower of everything.) meaning, Allah knows who deserves this life, and so He gives him riches, and whoever deserves poverty, He makes him poor. He also knows who deserves the Hereafter, and He directs him to perform the deeds that will help him to be sucessful in it, and whoever deserves failure, He prevents him from achieving righteousness and what leads to it."	0
11	Ibn Umar reported GodÂs Messenger as saying, Do not prevent your women from coming to the mosques, but their houses are better for them.	0
12	Women are legally disadvantaged by Islamic law in several in several domains of life. Particularly, women are disadvantaged in matters of sexual, domestic, legal, financial, sartorial, and physical autonomy. According to Islamic legal theory, while not all of Islamic law necessarily has a perceptibly rational basis.	1
13	The answer to this is that these verses are not unconditional, to be applied to every Jew, Christian, or non-Muslim. Interpreting them in this manner contradicts the injunctions of the QurÂan which enjoin affection and kindness to the good and peace-loving peoples of every religion, as well as the verses which permit marriage to the women of the People of the Book, with all that Allah says concerning marriage, (And He has put love and mercy between you,] (Ar-Rum 30:21) and the verse concerning the Christians, [And thou wilt find those who say, ÂSurely we are Christians.Â to be nearest to them (the Muslims) in affection) (Al-MaÂidah 5:85). The verses that imply breaking ties with People of Book refer to those people who were hostile to Islam and waged war against Muslims. Accordingly, it is not permissible for Muslims to support or assist them Â that is, to be their ally Â nor to entrust them with secrets at the expense of Islam or Muslim community.	0
14	The Messenger of God, may GodÂs prayers and peace be upon him, established for the woman an independent financial liability, like a man, as he recognized her the right to own, sell, buy and so on. Among the most prominent financial rights of a woman is her right to the dowry, and God has imposed it on the husband in honor of the woman and to show the sincerity of the manÂs desire for her, and to be dear and generous, so she is the one who is required, not asking, and just as the woman at marriage has the right to the dowry, after its conclusion, she has the right to alimony, and the alimony includes all other things. She carries out her life in terms of food, drink, clothing and housing. In the hadith on the authority of Umm Salamah, the husband of the Prophet, may GodÂs prayers and peace be upon him, she said: ÂI heard the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, say: Whoever spends on two daughters, or two sisters, or my blood relatives, he will count the alimony on them, until God enriches them by His grace, the Mighty and Sublime, or suffices them both. They were a shield for him from the Fire.Â Among the financial rights of women is also the right to inherit, and the Shariah in the QurÂan and the Sunnah have established this right.  The Almighty said: (The men have a share of what the parents and the closeness are left, and the women have a share of what the parents have left, and the closeness is from the one who is less)	0
15	The QurÂan describes the human as the trustee of Allah on earth. Allah created everything on earth and in the heavens for the benefit of the human race. Sanctity of human life is affirmed in the QurÂan [Nor take life, which God has made sacred, except for just cause] (Al-IsraaÂ 17:33). The QurÂan confirms GodÂs revelation to previous prophets that [If anyone slays a human being, unless it be (punishment) for murder, or for spreading mischief on earth, it shall be as though he had slain all humankind; whereas, if anyone saves a life, it shall be as though he had saved the lives of all humankind] (Al-MaÂidah 5:32). Beyond sanctity of life, in the QurÂan we read [Indeed, We (God) have conferred dignity on the children of Adam] (Al-IsraaÂ 17:70). It is noted that this verse is inclusive of all humans, irrespective of their religion or even their belief in God.	0
16	Alcohol is allowed in lslam and Muhammad allowed it  used to drink it in Authentic Hadith	1
17	"(Allah does not look at a man who had anal sex with another man or a woman.)  In addition, Imam Ahmad reported that, ""Allah's Messenger forbade anal sex with women, for Allah does not shy away from truth.'''. They all, along with the majority of the scholars, harshly rebuked the practice of anal sex and many of them called this practice a Kufr."	0
18	"Allah the Exalted clarifies the waiting period of the woman in menopause. And that is the one whose menstruation has stopped due to her older age. Her `Iddah is three months instead of the three monthly cycles for those who menstruate,  the same for the young, who have not reached the years of menstruation. (if you have doubt...) There are two opinions: First, is the saying of a group of the Salaf, like Mujahid, Az-Zuhri and Ibn Zayd. That is, if they see blood and there is doubt if it was menstrual blood or not. The second, is that if you do not know the ruling in this case, then know that their `Iddah is three months. This has been reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr and it is the view preferred by Ibn Jarir. And this is the more obvious meaning. Supporting this view is what is reported from Ubay bin Ka`b that he said, ""O Allah's Messenger! Some women were not mentioned in the Qur'an, the young, the old and the pregnant. "	0
19	Abu Huraira reported GodÂs Messenger as saying, A woman may be married for four reasons, for her property, her rank, her beauty and her religion; so get the one who is religious and prosper.	0
20	 And whoever does righteous good deeds, male or female, and is a true believer in the Oneness of Allah (Muslim), such will enter Paradise and not the least injustice, even to the size of a Naqira (speck on the back of a date-stone), will be done to them.	0
21	The eradication of race consciousness is one of the outstanding moral achievements of Islam. In the contemporary world there is, as it happens, a crying need for the propagation of this Islamic virtue. It is conceivable that the spirit of Islam might be the timely reinforcement, which would decide this issue in favor of tolerance and peace, the historian A.J. Toynbee wrote in his book Civilization on Trial. Islam unites the entire human race under one banner. To a world torn by national rivalries and feuds, it presents a message of life and hope, and of a glorious future.	0
22	Not a single Prophet lived during the time of Muhammad. And this is especially true regarding the Prophets with whom Allah concluded the Covenant. Yet, the QurÂan testifies that there would be Prophets present during the time of this Messenger. In fact, Allah swore these Prophets into his service to assist this forthcoming Messenger. And Allah himself bore witness with the Prophets that he will be with them to ensure the accomplishment of this Covenant. But there were no Prophets present during the time of Muhammad. This leaves us with two options. One: Allah was mistaken in his claim that there would be other Prophets during the appearance of this Messenger. Two: The Messenger mentioned in Surah 3:81 is referring to someone other than Muhammad. Either option spells disaster for Islam. What is even more damaging for Islam is the fact that Muhammad excluded himself as the Messenger of Surah 3:81. Why do we say that? This is because Muhammad clearly ruled out the prospect for the co-existence of any other Prophets during his career as the Messenger of Allah. In other words, no other Prophets are supposed to exist anywhere on planet earth as a contemporary of Muhammad. Muhammad openly testified to this conclusion when he precisely informed his early Companions of this outcome in the following Hadith.	1
23	Verily, those who believe (in Allah and in His Messenger Muhammad ), and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians, and the Magians, and those who worship others besides Allah, truly, Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Verily! Allah is Witness over all things	0
24	"Experiences online Dawah avoid or even block former Muslims because they know it is a lot harder to debate someone who know Islam as opposed to someone who does not know Islam. It is a lot easier to just say ""weak hadith"" when it is not weak, or misinterpretation / translations of the Quran when it is actually the correct translation or interpretation. And sometimes, they blatantly invent facts that are simply not true. As an Ex Muslim, I learned over the years not to waste my time debating Islamists as well, for the following reasons: - They are not interested in a genuine debate! Absolutely not. The debates are more like: let us show you that nothing you say can ""stick""! So, the Quranic verses we quote are ""misinterpretations"" and ""mistranslations"" even though I am Arab and I know exactly what they mean. Tafseer (explanation of the Quran) of the Quran is also wrong and they try to give it a different twist even thought this is what we all believe in for 1400 years!! And when we back it by the authentic hadith, they claim it is ""weak"" even thought the consensus among Islamic scholars is that it is authentic and correct. Tafseer (explanation of the Quran) of the Quran is also wrong and they try to give it a different twist even though this is what we all believe in for 1400 years!! Suddenly all the Muslim scholars become liars! It is a lot easier to just say ""weak hadith"" when it is not weak, or misinterpretation/translations of the Quran when it is actually the correct translation or interpretation. And sometimes, they blatantly invent facts that are simply not true. So tell me, how is this a debate when they would go out of their way to lie, twist, and deflect ...constantly moving the goal post so they would never admit their faith is less than perfect! But they fail!! They would get angry and start shouting, and block you.  One example, brother.dawah - he blocked me yet we never ever had one single message exchanged! One of his followers asked us to debate and the next thing, I got blocked. They would get angry and start shouting and block you."	1
25	"They ask your instruction concerning women. Say, ""Allah instructs you about them and about what is recited unto you in the Book...""). (whom you desire to marry...) also refers to the desire of the guardian not to marry an orphan girl under his supervision when she lacks property or beauty. The guardians were forbidden to marry their orphan girls possessing property and beauty without being just to them, as they generally refrain from marrying them (when they are neither beautiful nor wealthy).'' Consequently, when a man is the caretaker of a female orphan, he might like to marry her himself. In this case, Allah commands him to give her a suitable dowry that other women of her status get. If he does not want to do that, then let him marry other women, for Allah has made this matter easy for Muslims. Sometimes, the caretaker does not desire to marry the orphan under his care, because she is not attractive to his eye. In this case, Allah forbids the caretaker from preventing the female orphan from marrying another man for fear that her husband would share in the money that is mutually shared between the caretaker and the girl. Ibn `Abbas said, ""During the time of Jahiliyyah, the caretaker of a female orphan would cover her with his rope, and when he did that, no man would marry her. If she was beautiful and he desired to marry her, he married her and took control of her wealth. If she was not beautiful, he did not allow her to marry until she died, and when she died he inherited her money. Allah prohibited and outlawed this practice. '' He also said about Allah's statement, (and the children who are weak and oppressed,) that during the time of Jahiliyyah, they used to deny young children and females a share of inheritance. (and that you stand firm for justice to orphans.) ""Just as when she is beautiful and wealthy you would want to marry her and have her for yourself, so when she is not wealthy or beautiful, marry her and have her for yourself.'' Allah's statement, (And whatever good you do, Allah is Ever All-Aware of it.) encourages performing the good deeds and fulfilling the commandments, and states that Allah is knowledgeable of all of this and He will reward for it in the best and most perfect manner."	0
26	The QurÂan is schizophrenic, sometimes it says this and sometimes it says this, and the same Muslims who speak Arabic do not understand it.	1
27	Islam is international in its outlook and approach. It does not admit barriers and distinctions based on color, clan, blood or territory such as were prevalent before the advent of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). These are rampant in different forms, even in this modern age. Islam is a way of life that transcends race and ethnicity. The Glorious QurÂan repeatedly reminds us of our common origin: (O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honored of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).) (Al-Hujrat: 13)	0

29	Muhammad and his disgusting golden shower fetish. Take for example the case where a companion of the Prophet drinks his blessed urine, only to discover that she has now been shielded completely from the fire of Hell!	1
30	Furthermore, in Islam, learning is not simply a right of everyone; it is a duty and responsibility. Prophet Muhammad said, ÂSeeking knowledge is mandatory on a Muslim male and femaleÂ (Ibn Majah). This saying of the Prophet is confirmed by the QurÂan, which says that Allah endows a higher status on those who are knowledgeable. There is no provision in Islamic law that specifies areas of education permitted to women or areas prohibited. Areas of knowledge that are mandatory for both men and women to study include fundamental Islamic beliefs, acts of worship, and moral teachings. There are certain fields that are particularly recommended for women to study so that they can equip themselves better for the role for which Allah has created them, and these are medicine, nursing, home management, health care, and child psychology. Also other fields as arts, humanities, and sciences are permitted areas of study for both men and women, so long as they are beneficial. Prohibited areas are few, and include sorcery and magic for instance.	0
31	In addition, well-treatment of the woman, all as a daughter, wife, and a mother, was ordained. Her right to education was acknowledged and praised. Also, the right to inherit Â unprecedented before Islam in any civilization or tradition Â was given to her. WhatÂs more, as a wife, she was granted many rights, yet under the command of the husband, whereby no injustice or domination should be committed against her, and her right to divorce was assured. In addition, Islam regulated and limited polygamy which was not regulated in other cultures or under other monotheistic faiths.	0
32	Thanks to well-researched scholarly articles by devoted men and women on the subject of Islam, the truth about Islam is exposed as never before. Articles that expose Islam are easily available today on the Internet. However, Muslims claim that all these articles are based on lies. They deliberately make such claims even though what is written is based on their own Islamic sources. Such claims are made to deceive all those who are not familiar with the teachings of Islam. Muslims easily lie with an untroubled conscience because they are sanctioned to do so according to the teachings of Allah in the QurÂan. When Muslims lie, they emulate the deity whom they worship. Both the QurÂan and authentic Islamic sources are used here to prove beyond doubt that Allah is a liar. By the conclusion of the article above, it is evidently clear that Allah lied in the QurÂan.	1
33	If indeed the Kaaba is the true direction of prayer known by the jews and Christians, why did allah command Mohd to pray towards a wrong direction (Jerusalem) for 17 good years? Why did allah only changed the direction when Mohd didn't feel like praying towards Jerusalem no more? Isnt it obvious Mohd was making things up in the name of allah and looking for support and approval from the people of the book ?	1
34	Universal human dignity: The QurÂan gives various reasons why each human being must be honored and dignified on account of being human and irrespective of his or her chosen beliefs. Such honor is symbolized by the way the QurÂan describes AllahÂs creation of the human in the best of molds and commanding the angels to bow down in respect to Adam.	0
35	In Islam, problems are supposed to be faced and solvedÂnot ignored! So, rather than requiring hypocritical compliance, Islam provides legitimate and clean solutions to the problems of individuals and societies. There is no doubt that the second wife legally married and treated kindly is better off than a mistress without any legal rights. Through practical example, Prophet Muhammad as the guide of Muslims has set the applicable rules for this aspect of human relations in order not to leave anything for speculation.	0
36	It was narrated that: Sulaiman bin Amr bin Ahwas said: My father told me that he was present at the Farewell Pilgrimage with the Messenger of Allah. He praised and glorified Allah, and reminded and exhorted (the people). Then he said: 'I enjoin good treatment of women, for they are prisoners with you, and you have no right to treat them otherwise, unless they commit clear indecency. If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark. If they obey you, then do not seek means of annoyance against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they are not to allow anyone whom you dislike to tread on your bedding (furniture), nor allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses. And their right over you are that you should treat them kindly with regard to their clothing and food.	0
37	As Europeans abandon their faith and embrace atheism, the vacuum is readily gobbled up by lsIam. Because of the huge Wahabbi funding, churches are quickly sold off. And by the sheer number of immigrants trooping into Europe and their high birth rates, IsIamization of Europe is ripe. How about new conversions? lsIam is a magnet for depraved and ignorant people. They are swallowing the bait, hook and sinker of dawah lies. lsIam is not just a religion but a socio-cultural ideology with political ambitions of world domination. So, there are those who use lsIam for social affiliation, political ambition and economic or monetary motivation. Those tentacles are too many to be dismembered. Plus it is in the devil's grand scheme that depraved people are the majority for the success of his mission and dominate mankind. I just pity how Europe will turn into Middle East in less than half a century. Barbary sIavery version 2.0 is beckoning.	1
38	The Qur'an CAN NOT be the word of God!. PREMISE 1: Either the Bible is the Word of God or the Quran is the word of God... PREMISE 2: If the Bible is the Word of God, the QurÂan is not. * Premise 2 - is easy to establish, since the QurÂan and the Bible fundamentally contradict one another. PREMISE 3: If the Bible is not the Word of God, the QurÂan is not. * Premise 3 - The QurÂan, over and over again, AFFIRMS the Christian Scriptures, claiming consistency with them, and asserting that the Torah and the Gospel (the ÂInjilÂ), and also the Psalms (Zabur), ARE PREVIOUS REVELATIONS FROM ALLAH. (Q 2:123, 3:3, 18:27, 6:64). CONCLUSION: Therefore, the QurÂan is not the Word of God.	1
39	Abdallah b. Amr reported GodÂs Messenger as saying: The whole world is to be enjoyed, but the best thing in the world is a good woman	0
40	WomenÂs Rights in Islam Surpass Modern Systems If women in the Muslim World today donÂt have their rights, it is not because Islam didnÂt give them rights. Alien traditions have overshadowed the teachings of Islam, either through ignorance or the impact of colonialism. Most of the so-called modern reforms in the status of women appeared after the West abandoned religion for secularism. Those in the West who claim to follow the Judeo-Christian tradition really follow the values of Western liberalism. In England and America less than fifty years ago, a woman could not buy a house or car without the co-signature of a male ÂguardianÂ! In Contrast, Islamic Law guaranteed rights to women over 1400 years ago that were unheard of in the West until the 1900s.	0
41	Islam is keen, within its long history in dealing with the People of the Book, to provide them with freedom of belief and religion, whatever their perceptions and opinions, and we realize this from the nature of the treaties that Islam provided for them.	0
42	"(There is no compulsion in religion), meaning, ""Do not force anyone to become Muslim, for Islam is plain and clear, and its proofs and evidence are plain and clear. Therefore, there is no need to force anyone to embrace Islam. Rather, whoever Allah directs to Islam, opens his heart for it and enlightens his mind, will embrace Islam with certainty. Whoever Allah blinds his heart and seals his hearing and sight, then he will not benefit from being forced to embrace Islam.'' (There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the right path has become distinct from the wrong path.)'' (Whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower) is in reference to, ""Whoever shuns the rivals of Allah, the idols, and those that Shaytan calls to be worshipped besides Allah, whoever believes in Allah's Oneness, worships Him alone and testifies that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him"	0
43	The People of the Book are described by God in His Book, and they are the Jews and the Christians. They are called the People of the Book; Because God sent down to them two books on the Children of Israel; The first is against Moses, which is the Torah, and the second is against Jesus, which is the Gospel. That is why they are called: People of the Book, and they are called: People of the Two Books.	0

""Each time we sleep with a Hoor we find her virgin. Besides, the penis of the Elected never softens. The erection is eternal; the sensation that you feel each time you make love is utterly delicious and out of this world and were you to experience it in this world you would faint. Each chosen one will marry seventy [sic] houris, besides the women he married on earth, and all will have appetizing vaginas."	1

46	Mecca (Bakkah) existed pre-Islam as a religious center Pre-Islam, Mecca was known as one of the most important religious places of worship in the Arabian world. It appears to have been a multifaith place of worship, with a large Jewish, Christian, and pagan (Hindu) community co-existing peacefully with each other. Their friendship is documented in the Quran and the texts confirm that the natives lived in harmony with each other before MohammedÂs invasions, indoctrination and forced conversions. Due to their mutual friendship Muslims were ordered to view them as enemies and to be avoided. There appears to have been many different temples, churches and synagogues in the region from which Mohammed and his men acquired loot, wealth, religious texts, and discoveries and inventions. The Kaaba was already in existence when Mohammed and his gang of looters invaded Mecca and slaughtered its inhabitants. Anyone in his path was killed unless they converted to his new-found warlike religion and raided and fought with Mohammed and his army. If they refused to convert and were wealthy with an income source and wanted to survive MohammedÂs executions, they had to pay jizya, extortion tax Â an obligatory duty to all non-Muslims. Parts of the Kaaba had then been ruined by floods during MohammedÂs age and Mohammed therefore reinstated the old temple	1

56	We are lucky to be at a time when the internet is available. You are a generation the missed out on a lot of bullshits -though some of it still exists! There had been many fear tactics used to subdue people to stay in the faith...this is not particularly limited to Islam at all, but growing up in the faith, I can tell you the amount of bullshits that suggest swift and powerful revenges of Allah are so extra ordinary that in my days (before the internet) we truly believed it...like the example of leaving Islam giving us cancer -instantly. When AIDS first came out, it was suggested that it is Allah's direct punishment to homosexuals - not mentioning that many straight people got it and Lesbians did not get it!!! There are people now, in my close circle of religious friends and family, who believe no one EVER leaves Islam - because it is perfect!! Yet if they ever switched their brains on and read the Quran they would find it full of scientific errors and hadith packed with immoral command. They are some who believe birth deformity is a punishment from Allah -even though in our culture of close relative marriages is a lot higher than in the West. We need this and other internet outlet to show everyone...we are no different, we have ridiculous claims just like you, we have scientific errors in our holy book just like you...and our prophet is not an example of humanity or morality by any standards. If it is cold and you need to warm up, burn any book (holy or otherwise) they will all equally warm you and nothing else will happen to you.	1

59	"Allah the Exalted states that the believers who spend in charity will come on the Day of Resurrection with their light preceding them in the area of the Gathering, according to the level of their good deeds, (their light running forward before them), he said, ""They will pass over the Sirat according to their deeds. Some of them will have a light as large as a mountain, some as a date tree, some as big as a man in the standing position. The least among them has a light as big as his index finger, it is lit at times and extinguished at other times.'' Ad-Dahhak commented on the Ayah, ""Everyone will be given a light on the Day of Resurrection. When they arrive at the Sirat, the light of the hypocrites will be extinguished. When the believers see this, they will be concerned that their light also will be extinguished, just as the light of the hypocrites was. This is when the believers will invoke Allah, `O our Lord! Perfect our light for us.''' (and in their right hands.). (Glad tidings for you this Day! Gardens under which rivers flow,) meaning, it will be said to them, ""Receive glad tidings this Day, of gardens beneath which rivers flow, (to dwell therein forever!), you will remain therein forever,'' (Truly, this is the great success!)."	0
60	According to the Quran, all peace loving Muslims, those who don't fight or drive unbelievers out of their cities are hypocrites & are close to unbelief than faith, this makes over 95% of today's Muslims. Surah 3:167: And the Hypocrites also. These were told: ÂCome, fight in the way of Allah, or drive the foe from your city.Â They said: ÂHad we known how to fight, we should certainly have followed you.Â They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith, saying with their lips what was not in their hearts but Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal. This means that the true believers of Islam must fight or they are labeled unbelievers and hypocrites. There's no middle ground, nothing like moderate Islam. So, according to the Quran, who are the true, non-hypocrite believers ? The short answer is Taliban, Al-qaeda, Boko Haram, Al-shabab...etc. The majority of Muslims are hypocrites, Allah said so.	1

62	"(Allah commands you for your children's (inheritance); to the male, a portion equal to that of two females). Ahmad recorded from Jabir that he said, ""The wife of Sa`d bin Ar-Rabi` came to Allah's Messenger and said to him, `O Allah's Messenger! These are the two daughters of Sa`d bin Ar-Rabi`, who was killed as a martyr at Uhud. Their uncle took their money and did not leave anything for them. They will not be married unless they have money.' The Messenger said, `Allah will decide on this matter.' The Ayah about the inheritance was later revealed and the Messenger of Allah sent word to their uncle commanding him. (if only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance;) We should mention here that some people said the Ayah only means two daughters, and that `more' is redundant, which is not true. Nothing in the Qur'an is useless or redundant. Had the Ayah been talking about only two women, it would have said, ""The share of both of them is two-thirds.'' As for the daughters, two or more, the ruling that they get two-thirds was derived from this Ayah, stating that the two sisters get two-thirds. We also mentioned the Hadith in which the Prophet commanded that two-thirds be the share of the two daughters of Sa`d bin Ar-Rabi`. So this is proven in the Book and the Sunnah. (if only one, her share is half.) If there are two daughters, then there are texts to prove they share a half. Therefore, two-thirds is the share of the two daughters or sisters, and Allah knows best. (For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each) There are several forms of the share that the parents get in the inheritance. 1. If the deceased left behind children, the parents get a sixth each. When the deceased had only one daughter, she gets half of the inheritance and the parents each one sixth, and another sixth is given to the father. 2. When the parents are the only inheritors, the mother gets one-third while the father gets the remaining two-thirds. In this case, the father's share will be twice the mother's share. If the deceased had a surviving spouse, the spouse gets half, in the case of a husband, or a fourth in the case of a surviving wife. In both cases, the mother of the deceased gets one-third of the remaining inheritance. This is because the remaining portion of the inheritance is treated just as the entire legacy in regard to the parents' share. Allah has given the mother one-half of what the father gets. Therefore, the mother gets a third of the remaining inheritance while the father gets two-thirds. 3. If the deceased left behind surviving brothers and sisters, whether half brothers, half sisters or from the same father and mother, their presence does not cause reduction in the father's share. Yet, their presence reduces the share of the mother to one-sixth instead of one-third, and the father gets the rest, when there are no other heirs. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Qatadah commented on the Ayah. (If the deceased left brothers or (sisters), the mother has a sixth.) ""Their presence will reduce the share of the mother, but they will not inherit. If there is only one surviving brother, the mother's share will remain one-third, but her share will be reduced if there is more than one surviving brother. The people of knowledge attribute this reduction in the mother's share from one-third (to one-sixth) to the fact that the father is the one who helps the brothers (and sisters) of the deceased get married, spending from his own money for this purpose. The mother does not spend from her money for this purpose.'' This is a sound opinion."	0

67	"Kaaba a Hindu Temple? [Note: A recent archeological find in Kuwait unearthed a gold-plated statue of the Hindu deity Ganesh. A Muslim resident of Kuwait requested historical research material that can help explain the connection between Hindu civilisation and Arabia.] Was the Kaaba Originally a Hindu Temple? By P.N. Oak (Historian) Glancing through some research material recently, I was pleasantly surprised to come across a reference to a king Vikramaditya inscription found in the Kaaba in Mecca proving beyond doubt that the Arabian Peninsula formed a part of his Indian Empire. The text of the crucial Vikramaditya inscription, found inscribed on a gold dish hung inside the Kaaba shrine in Mecca, is found recorded on page 315 of a volume known as ÂSayar-ul-OkulÂ treasured in the Makhtab-e-Sultania library in Istanbul, Turkey. Rendered in free English the inscription says: ""Fortunate are those who were born (and lived) during king VikramÂs reign. He was a noble, generous dutiful ruler, devoted to the welfare of his subjects. But at that time we Arabs, oblivious of God, were lost in sensual pleasures. Plotting and torture were rampant. The darkness of ignorance had enveloped our country. Like the lamb struggling for her life in the cruel paws of a wolf we Arabs were caught up in ignorance. The entire country was enveloped in a darkness so intense as on a new moon night. But the present dawn and pleasant sunshine of education is the result of the favour of the noble king Vikramaditya whose benevolent supervision did not lose sight of us- foreigners as we were. He spread his sacred religion amongst us and sent scholars whose brilliance shone like that of the sun from his country to ours. These scholars and preceptors through whose benevolence we were once again made cognisant of the presence of God, introduced to His sacred existence and put on the road of Truth, had come to our country to preach their religion and impart education at king VikramadityaÂs behest."""	1

The Imams said that one is allowed to mention marriage indirectly to the woman whose husband died. It is also allowed to indirectly mention marriage to a woman who had gone through final, irrevocable divorce. The Prophet ordered Fatimah bint Qays to remain in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum for `Iddah when her husband Abu `Amr bin Hafs divorced her for the third time. He said to her: (...or conceal it in yourself,) meaning, if you hide the intention of seeking marriage with them. Similarly, Allah said (Allah knows that you will remember them) meaning, in your hearts, so He made it easy for you. Allah then said: (but do not make a promise (of contract) with them in secret) means do not say to her, ""I am in love (with you),'' or, ""Promise me you will not marry someone else (after the `Iddah finishes),'' and so forth. This means taking the woman's promise not to marry someone else. (. ..except that you speak an honorable saying.) He said, ""He says to her Wali, `Do not give her away (in marriage) until you inform me first'.'' (And do not be determined on the marriage bond until the term prescribed is fulfilled.) meaning, do not make marriage contracts before the `Iddah finishes. (And know that Allah knows what is in your minds, so fear Him.) warning the men against the ideas they conceal in their hearts about women, directing them to think good about them rather than the evil, and Allah would not let them despair of His mercy, as He said: (And know that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.)"	0
71	In the time of the prophet, we find that he and his people were ruthlessly persecuted and forced out of their homes to flee their beloved town of Makkah. When the prophet (pbuh) and his followers were accorded a grand welcome in Madinah, by the people there, his enemies wanted to destroy the new religion that was taking root in the deserts of Arabia, even by eliminating Muhammad and his followers. It was in this context that the verses permitting fighting were revealed. It was here that fighting against the kuffar (literally non-believers) is mentioned. Here, the meaning is clear: the non-believers mentioned are those who sought to kill the prophet and his followers, only. This is because, the Holy QurÂan clearly says in Surah 18, verse 29: *{Say: The Truth is from your Lord Â Let him who will, believe, and let him who will, reject [it] }* The QurÂan also says in Surah 2, verse 256: *{There is no compulsion in religion; truly the right way has become clearly distinct from error; therefore, whoever disbelieves in the false deities and believes in Allah, he indeed has laid hold on the firmest handle, which shall not break off, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.}* So, the stand of Islam here is very clear. Islam does not approve the use of force in the propagation of religion. Since God commands not to use any kind of compulsion in religion, it is obviously ridiculous to argue that the Quran commands Muslims to kill non-Muslims. You can also read more about how Islam guarantees religious freedom.	0
72	ALLAH NEEDS A WOMAN TO HAVE A CHILD. ALLAH IS A MALE LIKE US. Muhammad in the Quran claims that there is nothing like unto his imaginary ego, (allah). But this is just one of the many lies in the Quran. So many times Muhammad proves allah was just like any ordinary mortal men. And like ordinary mortal men, allah requires a woman to have a son.  This is just one of the childish and ignorant statements in the Quran. But it also exposes the fact that allah, [whom Muslims claim is genderless], to be a male. Allah claims to require a female in other to have a son. This indicate that Allah is a male. And just like males require females to have children, allah also require females to have children. Allah is just like us. Allah is a male! Allah's got a peni$ and spÂ£rms, the only thing he's missing is a woman. For a god Muhammad claimed created everything with a simple word of BE, why would he 'need' a woman in other to have a son?

In fact, the Quran makes it clear that we are made of pottery clay!!!.	1
77	The QurÂan explains itself. Since the QurÂan is not ordered by topic (like textbook chapters), it is necessary for a scholar to be thoroughly familiar with other texts in the QurÂan which deal with the same topic or relate directly to it. Failure to do so may lead to selectivity, which may distort the overall message of the QurÂan concerning that topic. In fact, other texts in the QurÂan may be highly significant in determining the true meaning of a given text. In addition to the overall QurÂanic context, consideration should be given to the section in which a particular verse occurs. One of the most common serious mistakes is to quote only a part of a verse or one verse in an interrelated section of a surah(chapter) in such a way as to change its meaning. Consideration of the occasion of revelation (asbab al-nuzul) of certain verses, if known and authentic, affects the interpretation of that verse. If there is an authentic hadith dealing with the same topic as the QurÂanic verse, the hadith takes precedence over mere opinion or speculation. Keep in mind that some QurÂanic verses were revealed to deal with certain historical challenges facing the emerging and besieged Muslim community affects interpretation. Some of these challenges may not be present today, and if they are, they may take a different form. Some verses revealed to deal with such situations should not be unnecessarily generalized. 	0

79	Islam has given clear rulings for the kind treatment of captives. Whether a soldier is captured in battle or surrenders to the Muslims, he should be treated humanely. The example of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in this regard is well known, as he never enslaved a free man, never imprisoned anyone. The later followers of the Prophet imprisoned enemy soldiers and kept them as captives to be exchanged for Muslim captives held by the enemies. This was in accordance with this QurÂanic verse that says what means: *{If then anyone transgresses the prohibition against you, transgress ye likewise against him. But fear Allah, and know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.}* (Al-Baqarah 2:194) But the Prophet had given them clear instruction to treat the prisoners of war in a kind and humane manner. He said, ÂBeware of the prayer of the oppressed; for there is no barrier between it and Allah.Â Relating how the Companions complied strictly with this order given by the Prophet, one of the prisoners of the Battle of Badr, Huzayr ibn Humayr, stated, ÂWhenever they had lunch or dinner, they used to give me preference by providing me with bread while theyÃ¯?Â½d eat only dates, in showing compliance with the ProphetÃ¯?Â½s order of treating prisoners well.Â	0

83	Muhammad claimed himself to be a prophet of God. Is his claim true? To answer this vital question, we need to put Muhammad on the witness stand. In the best interest of everyone, Muslims included, we will allow the evidences from the sources of Islam itself answer this vital question on the lone Prophet of Islam. Islam claims that the QurÂan is the literal word of God, which was dictated word for word to Muhammad by Allah. Thus, Islam is an all-or-nothing religion. Any fault in the QurÂan, or doubts as to the truthfulness of Muhammad, can cause the whole system to collapse. Muslims have already come to realize the certainty of such an outcome. That is why they fly into tantrums whenever Muhammad or the QurÂan is criticized. Under Sharia law any criticism of either Muhammad or the QurÂan is considered as blasphemous, which carries a punishment of death. This hypersensitive defensiveness and outrage at criticism are certainly not the reactions of a confident belief system. But they are the expected reaction of a weak, information-control system. These reactions are evidence of an attempt to protect a fatal vulnerability, an attempt to cover a weakness Â an Achilles heel. The location of that Achilles heel is effectively demonstrated by the reaction of the Muslim world whenever the moral character of Muhammad or the teachings of Islam are challenged. We need to expose not only the offensive teachings of Islam but also the true nature of Muhammad	1

86	DID ABRAHAM AND ISHMAEL BUILD THE KAÂBA? Happy Eid to the Muslim community.Today we are reposting our discussion of the Ka'ba, the stone millions of pilgrims would have visited if covid-19 didn't happen. The QurÂan states explicitly that the Prophet Abraham  and the Prophet Ishmael built the sacred House of Allah: Though the location of the ÂHouse of AllahÂ is not stated in the above or any other verses of the QurÂan, all Muslims without exception insist that it refers to the ÂKaÂbaÂ in Mecca. Some translators have gone to the extent of inserting the word ÂMeccaÂ in parenthesis even though it does not appear in the original Arabic QurÂan. How could the Prophet Abraham and the Prophet Ishmael build the KaÂba in Mecca when the QurÂan clearly admits that no Prophets were sent to the Arabs before the time of Muhammad? Since Muslims insists that the Prophet Abraham and the Prophet Ishmael built the KaÂba in Mecca, then this assumption comes at a great cost to the Muslims. They have to now either accept that there is a serious contradiction in the QurÂan or accept the fact that the Prophet Abraham  and the Prophet Ishmael  could not have build the KaÂba in Mecca. As we have noted, numerous QurÂanic verses clearly testify that no Prophets were sent to the Arabs prior to the time of Muhammad. This simply means that the Prophet Abraham and the Prophet Ishmael could not have set foot in Arabia. Therefore, it is obvious that they could not have built the KaÂba. Since the KaÂba was already in existence before the time of Muhammad and since no Prophets of the true God were ever sent to the Arabs before the time of Muhammad, it leads us to one very obvious conclusion. Only the local pagan Arabs could have laid the foundation of the KaÂba.  Only they could have built the KaÂba. That the KaÂba  was indeed a pagan shrine before the coming of Islam is recognized in numerous authentic sources of Islam itself. When Muhammad conquered Mecca, he destroyed all the idols of the KaÂba with the exception of the preeminent idolÂthe Black Stone. The KaÂba which is known in Arabic as ÂBaitullahÂ means ÂHouse of Allah.Â Muslims will do well to ask themselves the following thought provoking questions: If the KaÂba was originally the House of Allah, how did it become a Pagan Temple  housing 360 idols? How could a House of God turn into a Temple of Pagan Idols? Exactly when did Allah allow this change to take place? How did the most sacred place for the Worship of Allah  become a place for the Worship of Idols? How is it possible for this corruption to occur in the first place? Why was Allah powerless to prevent the demonizing of his most sacred shrine through idolatry? What theological reason is there for Allah to permit his original House of Worship to become a Pagan Temple? The late Dr. Taha Husayn, a prominent professor of Arabic literature in Egypt, recognized that the information recorded in the QurÂan regarding the construction of the KaÂba at the hands of Abraham and Ishmael is historically impossible. And he gave the following reason why it is not possible: ÂThe case of this episode is very obvious because it is of recent date and came into vogue just before the rise of Islam. Islam exploited it for religious reasonsÂ (Quoted in Mizan al-Islam by Anwar al-Jundi, p. 170). In other words, the KaÂba did not and could not have existed at the time of Abraham. Furthermore, Islamic sources themselves reveal that the early Muslims prayed facing Jerusalem while the Pagans prayed facing the KaÂba. If the KaÂba was really built by Abraham and Ishmael, then why did the early Muslims spend more than a decade praying towards Jerusalem?	1
87	No single verse in the QurÂan, when placed in its proper textual and historical context, permits fighting others on the basis of their faith, ethnicity, or nationality. To do so contradicts several established values and principles discussed in the previous section. Combative jihad is not only restricted in terms of what may or may not justify it; it is also strictly regulated. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) taught us how to behave on the battlefield. As a Âhated act,Â war should not be resorted to if other peaceful and just means may stop aggression or oppression. Intentions must be pure and no selfish personal or nationalistic agenda should be the driving force. There must be a declaration of war by a legitimate authority after due consultation. No non-combatants should be hurt. All must refrain from looting and unnecessary destruction. Prisoners of war and the injured must be treated humanely.	0

90	The normative relationship between Muslims and non-Muslims is that of peace, justice, mercy, and mutual respect. Some may ask, however, how building and mainstreaming peace can be reconciled with the concept of Âholy war.Â The QurÂanic Arabic term jihad has been commonly mistranslated as Âholy war.Â The QurÂan was revealed in Arabic, not in English. The Arabic equivalent of the English expression Âholy warÂ is harb muqadasah, an expression that is not found anywhere in the QurÂan or in the authentic sayings of the Prophet of Islam (peace and blessings be upon him). Even when the QurÂan speaks about defensive war, it never glorifies it or calls it ÂholyÂ; rather, it is described as something which is inherently hated (Al-Baqarah 2:216-217). However, as a last resort, it may be better than doing nothing in the face of aggression or oppression. Furthermore, the term holy war means, lexically, a fight on behalf of one religion against the other(s). There is no verse in the QurÂan that condones fighting any peaceful non-Muslim on the sole ground that he or she is a non-Muslim. The QurÂan prohibits compulsion in religion (Al-Baqarah 2:256) and even allows one form of interfaith marriage. For example, a Muslim male may marry a Jewish or Christian woman (Al-MaÂidah 5:5). It may be argued, from a religious perspective, that the expression holy war is a contradiction in terms, as there is nothing ÂholyÂ about war and its resultsÂbloodshed, destruction and human suffering. It may be a lesser evil in some instances, but it may not be holy in itself. It may be useful to discuss the meaning of jihad in both its literal and religious meanings.	0

94	In Islam a woman is a completely independent personality. She can make any contract or bequest in her own name. She is entitled to inherit in her position as mother, as wife, as sister and as daughter. She has perfect liberty to choose her husband. Thus, after the advent of Islam, the ProphetÂs followers accepted his teachings and brought about a revolution in their social attitude towards women. They no longer considered women as mere chattels, but as an integral part of society. For the first time, women were given the right to have a share in inheritance. In the new social climate, women rediscovered themselves and became highly active members of society, rendering useful service, even during wars, which the pagan Arabs forced on the emerging Muslim umma. They carried provisions for the soldiers, nursed them, and even fought alongside them if it was necessary. It became a common sight to see women helping their husbands in the fields, carrying on trade and business independently, and going out of their homes to satisfy their needs.	0

It is He Who has created you from a single person, and He has created from him his wife, in order that he might enjoy the pleasure of living with her) (7:189). This refers to Hawwa'. Allah created her from Adam, from the short rib on his left. If Allah had made all of Adam's progeny male, and created the females from another kind, such as from Jinn or animals, there would never have been harmony between them and their spouses. There would have been revulsion if the spouses had been from a different kind. Out of Allah's perfect mercy He made their wives from their own kind, and created love and kindness between them. For a man stays with a woman because he loves her, or because he feels compassion towards her if they have a child together, or because she needs him to take care of her, etc. (Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect.)"	0
100	Prophet Muhammad is the Killing of Women and Children	1
101	Islam has decided that raising and educating women is one of the great deeds, and the Sharia has arranged a bountiful reward for that. The Messenger of God, may GodÂs prayers and peace be upon him, desired a good womanÂs upbringing of a girl and watch over her discipline; In the hadith: ÂWhoever takes care of two girls until they reach puberty, he and I will come on the Day of Resurrection like these two (and joining his fingers).Â And since the woman is addressed with the legal duties like men, she is responsible for her prayers, fasting, reading the QurÂan and other matters of her religion, and when that was the case, her fulfillment of the laws Her religion requires knowledge that is contrary to ignorance. Hence, the Messenger of God was keen on educating the girl, and called for the dissemination of knowledge among women, and this is one of their rights stipulated by Islam. In his Prophet and believed in Muhammad, may GodÂs prayers and peace be upon him, and the owned slave if he fulfilled the right of God and the right of his masters, and a man who was with a slave woman, so he disciplined her and disciplined her well, taught her and taught her well, then freed her and married her, then he has two rewards.Â	0
102	MUHAMMAD ON THE WITNESS STAND: There are very serious charges leveled against the Prophet of Islam. We will put Muhammad on the witness stand to see if these charges are true. Through the eyes of those who knew him, his contemporaries. We reflect on his moral character which he manifested during his prophetic career. We will see if his moral character qualifies him as a prophet of the true God. We will only use sources acceptable to Muslims to evaluate him. To evaluate Muhammad is of utmost importance because Islam stands and falls on the character of Muhammad. Today, Muslims are willing to kill and be killed because they believe that Muhammad is a true prophet of God. They should be told the truth. And we should not overlook the fact that Muhammad had the backing of Allah. Therefore, by looking at Muhammad we can see who Allah really is. Please consider the evidences provided below	1
103	"(When you marry believing women, and then divorce them) The marriage contract here is followed by divorce, which indicates that the divorce cannot be valid if it comes first. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""If someone were to say, `every woman I marry will ipso facto be divorced,' this does not mean anything, (no `Iddah have you to count in respect of them.) This is a command on which the scholars are agreed, that if a woman is divorced before the marriage is consummated, she does not have to observe the `Iddah (prescribed period for divorce) and she may go and get married immediately to whomever she wishes. The only exception in this regard is a woman whose husband died, in which case she has to observe an `Iddah of four months and ten days even if the marriage was not consummated. (So, give them a present, and set them free in a handsome manner.) The present here refers to something more general than half of the named dowery or a special gift that has not been named. (And if you divorce them before you have touched (had a sexual relation with) them, and you have fixed unto them their due (dowery) then pay half of that)."	0
104	Can Allah who commits multiple errors in a single QurÂanic verse qualify as the true God? His Covenant with the Prophets turns out to be false. His prophetic decision about the unification between the Prophets and the Messenger did not materialize as he foretold. There was not a single Prophet present at the time of Muhammad to validate his claim in Surah 3:81. This means that Allah is a fraud and the QurÂan is a lie.	1
105	"All of this was commanded by his Allah in the Medina Surahs (which are called Madaniya). And those chapters in the Quran still apply today. According to the Quran, There is no ""moderate"" Islam and no ÂradicalÂ Islam. It is just Islam and it is violent. The peaceful Makkiya surahs were abrogated by the violent Madaniya surahs."	1
106	And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart, but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allah has made it lawful).	0
107	The incarnation of God is the most insulting thing for Muhammadans they say God cannot do this most disgusting act of entering the ultimate degraded unholy realm of his creation. Mo's whole focus in his religion was based on sex, vagina, ass as represented by the vagina fertility stone of Kaba. He said Allah can have sex with houries & create children; this Allah (Lah god) commands them of sacrificing themselves even their infant children in the hatred of the people of God, and the hatred is so crazy that they keep fighting among themselves. Nothing holy exists in Islam. But the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob proved by coming in human form that how greatly he loves mankind that he sacrificed his son in the incarnation. Human creation is not degraded filthy and disgusting as Muslims believe in their evil hatred. The Messiah lived as a poor man & experienced the suffering, rejection and evil of the world but he showed the way to overcome everything through God, and proved his power over death. Muhammadans love death and hell thus they hate the love of God, the truth of God. They hate this joyful good news of the birth of Jesus. 	1
108	The inability of Muhammad and his allah to comprehend the concept of Trinity. By proving that it will be self evident that such a person ( Muhammad) could not possibly be a prophet	1

110	Muslims, you claim Muhammad is your example of everything including hygiene right? Quick question: Why does your prophet have lice? Narrated Zaynab: She was picking lice from the head of the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) while the wife of Uthman ibn Affan and the immigrant women were with him. They complained about their houses that they had been narrowed down to them and they were evicted from them. The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) ordered that the houses of the Immigrants should be given to their wives. Thereafter Abdullah ibn Mas'ud died, and his wife inherited his house in Medina. Sunan Abu Dawud 19:3074 Narrated Anas bin Malik: Allah's Apostle used to visit Um Haram bint Milhan she was the wife of 'Ubada bin As-Samit. One day the Prophet visited her and she provided him with food and started looking for lice in his head. Then Allah's Apostle slept and afterwards woke up smiling.	1
111	The Prophet (peace be upon him)said: If anyone has a female child, and does not bury her alive, or slight her, or prefer his children (i.e. the male ones) to her, Allah will bring him into Paradise. Uthman did not mention (male children).	0
112	"Allah says to His Messenger Muhammad : ""Say to the people, `What I have brought to you from your Lord is the truth, in which there is no confusion or doubt.''' (Then whosoever wills, let him believe; and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve.) This is a type of threat and stern warning, after which Allah says, (Verily, We have prepared), meaning made ready, (for the wrongdoers,) meaning those who disbelieve in Allah, His Messenger and His Book, (a Fire whose walls will be surrounding them.) Ibn Jurayj said that Ibn `Abbas said, (a Fire whose walls will be surrounding them.) ""A wall of fire.'' (And if they ask for drink, they will be granted water like Al-Muhl, that will scald their faces.) Ibn `Abbas said; ""Al-Muhl is thick water which is similar to the sediment in oil.'' Mujahid said, ""It is like blood and pus.'' `Ikrimah said, ""It is the thing that is heated to the ultimate temperature.'' Others said: ""It is everything that is melted.'' Qatadah said, ""Ibn Mas`ud melted some gold in a grove, and when it became liquid and foam rose to the top, he said, this is the thing that is most like Al-Muhl.'' Ad-Dahhak said: ""The water of Hell is black, and it itself is black and its people are black.'' There is nothing contradictory in these comments, for Al-Muhl includes all of these unpleasant characteristics, it is black, evil-smelling, thick and hot, as Allah said, (Terrible is the drink,) meaning, how awful this drink is. Similarly, He says in another Ayah: (and an evil Murtafaq!) means, how evil a place is the Fire to dwell and rest and gather."	0
113	"(And if anyone of the Mushrikin), whom you were commanded to fight and We allowed you their blood and property,' (seeks your protection), asked you for safe passage, then accept his request until he hears the Words of Allah, the Qur'an. Recite the Qur'an to him and mention a good part of the religion with which you establish Allah's proof against him, (and then escort him to where he can be secure) and safe, until he goes back to his land, his home, and area of safety, (that is because they are men who know not.) The Ayah says, `We legislated giving such people safe passage so that they may learn about the religion of Allah, so that Allah's call will spread among His servants. Ibn Abi Najih narrated that this Ayah, ""Refers to someone who comes to you to hear what you say and what was revealed to you (O Muhammad). Therefore, he is safe until he comes to you, hears Allah's Words and then proceeds to the safe area where he came from.'' The Messenger of Allah used to thereafter grant safe passage to those who came to him for guidance or to deliver a message. On the day of Hudaybiyyah, several emissaries from Quraysh came to him, they came mediating between him and the Quraysh pagans. They witnessed the great respect the Muslims had for the Prophet , which astonished them, for they never before saw such respect for anyone, kings nor czars. They went back to their people and conveyed this news to them; this, among other reasons, was one reason that most of them accepted the guidance. When Musaylimah the Liar sent an emissary to the Messenger of Allah, he asked him, ""Do you testify that Musaylimah is a messenger from Allah'' He said, ""Yes.''"	0
114	You will surely find the most bitter towards the believers to be the Jews and polytheists and the most gracious to be those who call themselves Christian. That is because there are priests and monks among them and because they are not arrogant.	0
115	The exception is made for many reasons, but letÂs note only one here, addressing your concern that Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) Âhad intercourse outside of wedlock.Â In Western society, it is common for a man to have mistresses or multiple extra-marital affairs. Women in this case are degraded to mere sex objects with absolutely no rights; theyÂre usually on the losing end of such liaisons. The same society, however, cannot accept a man having more than one wife so that women can retain their lawful rights and lead an honorable, dignified, and respectable life. If every adult American man married only one woman, there would still be more than 25 million women in the United States who would not be able to get husbands, at least considering thatÂaccording to latest statisticsÂ10 percent of the American population is gay! ThatÂs close to 30 million people! Thus the only option for a woman who cannot find a husband is either to marry a married man or to become Âpublic property.Â Islam gives women the honorable position by permitting the first option and disallowing the second. At least one of the reasons Islam has permitted limited polygamy is to protect the modesty of women!	0
116	Was Maria the Copt a Slave, a Concubine, or a Wife of the Prophet? Slavery already existed long before Islam. It was a system whereby a human captured in wars or kidnapped could be sold as a Âpossession.Â That term applied to both sexes, not to women only. In some cultures slaves were considered subhuman and treated brutally. In Europe, for example, Romans threw Christian slaves to the lions while the public cheered; female slaves were thought to have no souls and were tortured mercilessly; slaves lived in degrading conditions; both sexes were forced to offer sexual favors to their masters; and as ÂpossessionsÂ they had no choice, no will, and no rights. Islam recognized the human rights of slaves and encouraged Muslims to set slaves free. Islam prohibited adultery and homosexuality, and prevented forcing female slaves into sexual acts against their will. Islam encouraged educating them, setting them free, then legally marrying them and giving them their moral and financial rights. The reward for thisÂas mentioned in Prophetic HadithÂis eternal residence in Paradise. Maria was not a concubine; she was a slave owned by EgyptÂs Christian governor, who offered her and her sister SerineÂamong other presentsÂas a Âgift of good willÂ to the Prophet in reply to his envoys inviting him to Islam. On her way from Egypt to Madinah, she was curious to learn about Âher new masterÂ and listened to his Companions talk about him. As a result, she became Muslim before meeting Muhammad. ScholarsÂ opinions vary of her status afterwards; here is the opinion I support: One of the prominent Al-Azhar scholars, Sheikh Abdul Majid Subh, states: ÂProphet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), instead of taking concubines, entered into lawful marriages based on reason and wisdom. Maria the Copt was given to him as a present, but rather than taking her as a concubine, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) married her, thus elevating her status by marriage.Â	0
117	In religious or sectarian history, it was Islam that, for the first time ever, adopted an attitude of mercy and caring for the captured enemy. Unprecedented by previous legal systems, and long before the Geneva Convention, Islam set the rule that the captive is sheltered by his captivity and the wounded by his injury. Whether in war or peace, Islam insists that its injunctions are to be strictly observed. Worship does not cease during wartime. Islamic jurisprudence maintains that whatever is prohibited during peace is also prohibited during war. Here is the actual command of God permitting fighting; the QurÂan says what means: *{Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but begin not hostilities. Lo! Allah loves not aggressors.}* (Al-Baqarah 2:190) The above permission to fight lays down clearly the following conditions: (1) Never commit aggression; fighting is allowed only for self-defense. (2) Fighting must never be against non-combatants or non-fighting personnel.	0
118	Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported God's Messenger as saying, The most serious breach of trust in GodÂs sight on the day of resurrection ... A version has, ÂAmong those who will have the worst position in GodÂs sight on the day of resurrection is the man who has intercourse with his wife, and she with him, and then spreads her secret. i.e. talks about the subject to others, or tells people about defects or beauties he has found in her.	0
119	The jizya is a financial tax on the money of non-Muslims who live under the rule of Islam, in order to contribute to the budget of the state that protects them in their lives, money, and honor, as it is in return for what is taken from the Muslim. The Muslim takes from him one-fifth of the spoils, the zakat, the al-Fitr charity, and other things such as penances for various sins. The jizya is spent on public interests, and on the poor people of dhimmis as well, and the jizya is imposed on the people of the book.	0
120	"ISLAM IS PEACEFUL: THE LIE: All Muslim terrorists kill for the same reason the Saudi terrorists did on 9/11, the same reason ISIS  killed, raped and enslaved whole communities of Yazidis in Iraq, the same reason Boko Haram is killing Christians in North Eastern Nigeria, the same reason Muhammad waged wars against non Muslims in and out of Medina. The reason? The Islamic Quran commands it.  Allah commands it. Millions of Muslims cry out ""Islam is peaceful!... Islam is peaceful!"". How can the majority of Muslims claim it is a peaceful religion? BecauseÂ most have not read the Quran, or the ÂHadithsÂ that expound on the verses in the Quran and the life of the Muslim prophet Muhammad. Most rely on what the sheikhs and imams preach, which is only half the story, the other half is the bloody version of Islam, which is the standing order of Allah to-date, since the peaceful verses were abrogated by the newest violent chapters after Muhammad failed to peacefully win over the Jews, Christians, and the stone-worshipers of Mecca. The culture of Eastern Muslims is to rely on and believe what those in authority say. And most of the leaders,sheikhs or Imams proclaim  the innocent and tolerant version of the Quran and Muhammad. Obedience is a sacred trait of the Muslim faith. The word Islam means Âto surrender.Â"	1

Their uncle took their wealth, without leaving any wealth for them, and they will not be married unless they have wealth. He said: Allah will decide on that matter.

Umm Salamah then asked: Is washing necessary for a woman if she sees that (in her dream)? He replied: Yes. Woman are counterpart of men.	0
130	So much of the Quran is devoted to redundant claims and threats about MuhammadÂs status as a prophet, yet there is not a single original moral value. Nowhere does it tell men not to rape women or refrain from sex with children.  In fact, it gives men permission to rape their slaves and implies that sex with children is permissible (verse 65:4). WouldnÂt a perfect book teach perfect morality?	1

Otherwise, he must decide to divorce her on good terms, without abusing, cursing, or admonishing her. To the contrary, he should divorce her on good terms, observing kindness and good manners. (And take as witness two just persons from among you.) meaning when taking her back, if this is your decision. Abu Dawud recorded that `Imran bin Husayn was asked about a man who divorced his wife and then had sexual intercourse with her, without notifying witnesses of when he divorced her and when he took her back. `Imran said, ""His divorce and taking her back was in contradiction to the Sunnah. Incorporate the presence of witnesses for divorcing her and taking her back, and do not repeat your conduct. (That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day.) means, `this, Our command to you to have witnesses in such cases and to establish the witness, is implemented by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.' This legislation is meant to benefit those who fear Allah's punishment in the Hereafter. (And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.)'' `Ikrimah also commented on the Ayah, ""Whoever divorces as Allah commanded him, then Allah will make a way out for him."	0
135	Allah commands you regarding your children: the share of the male will be twice that of the female. If you leave only two or more females, their share is two-thirds of the estate. But if there is only one female, her share will be one-half. Each parent is entitled to one-sixth if you leave offspring. But if you are childless and your parents are the only heirs, then your mother will receive one-third. But if you leave siblings, then your mother will receive one-sixthÂafter the fulfilment of bequests and debts. Be fair to your parents and children, as you do not fully know who is more beneficial to you. This is an obligation from Allah. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.	0
136	It is not uncommon these days to hear the Muslim lie; Islam is a religion of peace. Really? Then, how do we explain all the violence committed day after day by Muslims all over the world? Where does their incentive to kill come from? It is incredible how Muslims can even come up with such an absurd allegation. The answer is blowing in the wind. It is blowing all over the world where Muslims routinely murder innocent people on a daily basis in the name of Allah. And many are turning their heads pretending not to see the connection between the teachings of Allah in the QurÂan and the violence perpetrated by Muslims. And they deliberately ignore the fact that Islam is directly responsible for many of the violence that we are now experiencing around the globe. They want us to turn a blind eye to the reality. And they think that by repeatedly proclaiming the lie that ÂIslam means peaceÂ we will somehow become oblivious to all the violent acts committed right before our eyes in the name of Islam. Both Muslims and Christians are on the world stage. It does not take much looking around to see which group is killing, raping, torturing and beheading in the name of its religion. If you put 100 Christians of different denominations in a room, you will find them arguing over virtually every aspect of their faith. But, you would not find them debating whether theyÂre supposed to be out killing cartoonists, shooting up schools, murdering some neighbors, beheading fellow-workers, taking hostages at a cafÃ©, or blowing themselves up at some crowded places. Only one religion does that. There are criminals in every society. Criminals carry out their evil crimes by submitting to their own evil desires and acting on those cravings. However, in Islam it is different. Muslims carry out their violent crimes in the name of Allah. Every beheading, every attack by suicide bombers, and every violent act that is religiously sanctioned in Islam is carried out to the accompaniment of the blood-thirsty cries of ÂAllahu AkbarÂÂthe war cry of Islam. And jihadists often quote passages from the QurÂan before executing their victims. The evil crimes of the Muslims originate with Allah. The seeds of terror and the violence that we are now witnessing worldwide are sown in the QurÂan. To those who disagree that the QurÂan encourages violence, we would like them to examine the facts. Can Muslims honestly say that the QurÂan promotes peace when it teaches Muslims to slay those who leave Islam?	1

If in Janna EVERYTHING is given to you does it mean that other men can actually ask to have sex with your daughter and it's granted??? What sick cult is this??? Abu Umama narrated: ""The Messenger of God said, 'Everyone that God admits into paradise will be married to 72 wives; two of them are houris and seventy of his inheritance of the [female] dwellers of hell. All of them will have libidinous sex organs and he will have an ever-erect penis.' "" Sunan Ibn Maja, Zuhd (Book of Abstinence) 39 ""Each time we sleep with a Houri we find her virgin. Besides, the penis of the Elected never softens. The erection is eternal; the sensation that you feel each time you make love is utterly delicious and out of this world and were you to experience it in this world you would faint. Each chosen one [i.e. Muslim] will marry seventy [sic] houris, besides the women he married on earth, and all will have appetizing vaginas."" Al-Itqan fi Ulum al-Qur'an, p. 351"	1

(because of the evil of that whereof he has been informed. Shall he keep her with dishonor or bury her in the earth) meaning should he keep her, humiliating her, not letting her inherit from him and not taking care of her, preferring his male children over her.

143	Mary (Miriam) the sister of Aaron (and of Moses), is a phrase used in the Quran to refer to Mary the mother of Jesus. From at least the 8th century, and perhaps as far back as Muhammad's time, critics have attacked this verse as a simple but revealing error. In Arabic both Mary the mother of Jesus and Mary the sister of Aaron and Moses are called by the same name, (Maryam). Skeptical Jewish and Christian scholars believed that Muhammad had mistaken Jesus' mother for Moses' sister. While they shared a name, according to the Bible these two women lived more than a thousand years apart. In the hadith Muhammad explains that this criticism was a misunderstanding, but, according to these same texts many remained unconvinced. Ultimately, it seems, the Hadith and sirah traditions came to assert that Aaron and Moses had a sister whose name was Kulthum rather than Miriam, which seems to point to the traditionÂs fundamental inability to understand the context of these verses and how they relate to the two biblical Miriams. In contrast to the traditional narrative, modern scholars have rather found in this surah a complex web of inter-textual references, pointing to a highly literate and Christian audience of the original text.	1
144	MUHAMMAD ONLY FOUGHT IN SELF DEFENSE & MUSLIMS ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO FIGHT IN SELF DEFENSE. This is the response of moderate Muslims when confronted with the violent activities of their fellow radical Muslim brothers. They quote parts and pieces of the Qur'an which remotely speaks about defending oneself.  Muhammad after attacking innocent cities, killing their men who came out to defend themselves and their families, will share their daughters and wives to his jihadists army and encourage them to rape the captive women. The question I always ask the so called moderate Muslims is, WHAT IS SELF DEFENSE IN RAPING CAPTIVE WOMEN? If indeed Muhammad advocated for fighting only in self defense, why would he and his followers be raping women? If this actions and teachings of Muhammad produces radical Muslim jihadists today, then the real person to blame for Islamic terrorism is the figure head of Islam, Muhammad the Prophet of Islam. Radical Muslims are more like Muhammad and his teaching than Moderate Muslims.	1
145	"As mentioned, despite being a small book, the Quran is supposed to be the timeless, unchangeable word of God.  Why would God use precious and valuable space on the personal life of one man - the same one who happens to be narrating the ""revelation""? Consider verse 33:53: O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet's houses, except when leave is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation. But when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken your meal, disperse, without sitting for a talk. Verily, such (behaviour) annoys the Prophet, and he is shy of (asking) you (to go), but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth. That has to be immortalized on a tablet in heaven? Substantial portions of the Quran (particularly suras 33 and 66) are equally self-serving and address the sex, money or respect from his wives to which Muhammad is entitled.  Moreover, several such passages are repetitive. CouldnÂt Allah have thought of a more important message for mankind than telling us (several times over) that Muhammad may sleep with an unlimited number of women?"	1

148	The Dark Nature of MuhammadÂs Revelations:  We begin our further critical examination of Islam with the person of Muhammad and his revelations.  For this is where it all started.  If we expect to accurately discern the spirit of Islam then we must begin at the foundation, we must examine the seed.  Muhammad is the founder of Islam and is believed by Muslims to be the sole human instrument that ÂreceivedÂ the words of the Quran directly from Allah.  This chapter will review the nature of MuhammadÂs spiritual encounters that led to his career as a ÂprophetÂ and birthed the religion that now has the attention of the world.	1
149	"The euphoria one gets from praying and believing they are the centre of universe is well documented. It is not linked to one religion or faith. Every person who believes in supernatural power tends to experience it from the Quechua amazonian tribes to Zoroastrian who worship fire. And that is why you get euphoria rituals from dancing, kneeing, having candles or incenses, and associating the faith with ""higher spirituality"" - really the word here is being ""high"" full stop! But we suspect, if other religions are some kind of addictive drug, Islam is the strong version of it. We would group Islam at same level as heroin. Now you know why some people get very angry or even aggressive when you challenge their faith. Imagine how a drug addict would get very angry or even aggressive when you try to cut off their supply of drug or challenge them to stop!"	1
150	"(And tell the believing women to lower their gaze) meaning, from that which Allah has forbidden them to look at, apart from their husbands. Some scholars said that it is permissible for women to look at non-Mahram men without desire, as it was recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah was watching the Ethiopians playing with spears in the Masjid on the day of `Id, and `A'ishah the Mother of the believers was watching them from behind him and he was concealing her from them, until she got bored and went away. (and protect their private parts). Sa`id bin Jubayr said: ""From immoral actions.'' Abu Al-`Aliyah said: ""Every Ayah of the Qur'an in which protecting the private parts is mentioned means protecting them from Zina, (and not to show off their adornment except that which is apparent,) means, they should not show anything of their adornment to non-Mahram men except for whatever it is impossible to hide. Ibn Mas`ud said: ""Such as clothes and outer garments,'' Meaning what the Arab women used to wear of the veil which covered their clothes and whatever showed from underneath the outer garment. There is no blame on her for this, because this is something that she cannot conceal. Similar to that is what appears of her lower garment and what she cannot conceal. (and to draw their veils all over their Juyub) means that they should wear the outer garment in such a way as to cover their chests and ribs, so that they will be different from the women of the Jahiliyyah, who did not do that but would pass in front of men with their chests completely uncovered, and with their necks, forelocks, hair and earrings uncovered. So Allah commanded the believing women to cover themselves. (and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband's fathers, or their sons, or their husband's sons, or their brothers or their brother's sons, or their sister's sons,) All of these are a woman's close relatives whom she can never marry (Mahram) and it is permissible for her to show her adornments to them, but without making a wanton display of herself. (or their women,) this means that she may also wear her adornment in front of other Muslim women, but not in front of the women of Ahl Adh-Dhimmah (Jewish and Christian women), lest they describe her to their husbands. This is prohibited for all women, but more so in the case of the women of Ahl Adh-Dhimmah, because there is nothing to prevent them from doing that, but Muslim women know that it is unlawful and so, would be deterred from doing it. (or their right hand possessions. ) Ibn Jarir said, ""This means from among the women of the idolators. It is permissible for a Muslim woman to reveal her adornment before such a woman, even if she is an idolatress, because she is her slave-girl. (Tabi`in among men who do not have desire,) such as hired servants and followers who are not at the same level as the woman and are feeble-minded and have no interest in or desire for women. Ibn `Abbas said, ""This is the kind of person who has no desire.'' `Ikrimah said, ""This is the hermaphrodite, who does not experience erections.'' This was also the view of others among the Salaf. It was narrated in the Sahih from `A'ishah that a hermaphrodite, used to enter upon the family of the Messenger of Allah and they used to consider him as one of those who do not have desire, but then the Messenger of Allah came in when he was describing a woman with four rolls of fat in front and eight behind. (or children who are not aware of the nakedness of women. ) Because they are so young they do not understand anything about women or their `Awrah or their soft speech or their enticing ways of walking and moving. If a child is small and does not understand that, there is nothing wrong with him entering upon women, but if he is an adolescent or approaching adolescence, so that he knows and understands these things, and can make a distinction between who is beautiful and who is not, then he should not enter upon women. and (The male in-law is death.) And let them not stamp their feet...) to the end of it. From that, women are also prohibited from wearing scent and perfume when they are going outside the home, lest men should smell their perfume."	0

152	All these groups are Islam terrorist groups and u are telling me that this evil religion called Islam shouldn't be abolished in our world.	1
153	The few texts must be interpreted in the light of the many texts. For example, the QurÂan repeatedly affirms the freedom of conscience and rejects compulsion in religion. However, we encounter some verses in the QurÂan which allow fighting non-Muslims. To understand these later verses as permitting fighting against others because of their rejection of Islam or in order to force or coerce them to accept Islam is to disregard many QurÂanic texts that are inconsistent with that interpretation. 	0
154	The predominant idea in the teachings of Islam with regard to men and women is that a husband and wife should be full-fledged partners in making their home a happy and prosperous place. They should also be loyal and faithful to one another, genuinely interested in each otherÂs welfare and the welfare of their children. A woman is expected to exercise a humanizing influence over her husband and to soften the sternness inherent in his nature. Once a woman came to the Prophet (pbuh), with a complaint against her husband. He told her: ÂThere is no woman who removes something to replace it in its proper place, with a view to tidying her husbandÂs house, but that God sets it down as a virtue for her. Nor is there a man who walks with his wife hand-in-hand, but that God sets it down as a virtue for him; and if he puts his arm round her shoulder in love, his virtue is increased tenfold.Â	0
155	Abdallah b. Mas'ud reported GodÂs Messenger as saying, Young man, those of you who can support a wife should marry, for it keeps you from looking at strange women and preserves you from immorality; but those who cannot should devote themselves to fasting, for it is a means of suppressing sexual desire.	0
156	"One of the biggest scientific mistakes in the Quran, the Quran claims the earth is flat.  We have eleven verses in the Quran that describes the earth as flat like a rug, carpet, bed, and spread. BUT not one single verse suggesting the earth is Spherical or round - very easy words found in Arabic. The verses are: Quran [2:22], [15:19], [20:53], [43:10], [50:7], [51:48], [71:19], [78:6-7], [79:30], [88:20], [91:6].. To name few all backed by Hadith the confirms Muhammad truly believed the earth is flat. All that narration and translations were put under the ""carpet"" in the 1960's when man landed on the moon. Mashallah. Dr Joker Zakri, pressed again and again that rh Quran has a major problem, invented the suggestion that verse 79:30 suggests the Dahaha means ostrich egg. What a load of bullshit! Anyone with basic Arabic knowledge can tell Dahaha is a verb and not a noun. And we'll informed Arabs will tell you it means spreading , like when we spread bread."	1

158	O humanity! Indeed, We created you from a male and a female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you may get to know one another. Surely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous among you. Allah is truly All-Knowing, All-Aware.	0
159	"We were told that no one can do a book like the Quran, I did not realise it means as bad as this book! It is a collection of organised chaos. Allah the all-mighty goes from.one story to another. For example, the story of Prophet Lut is spread over five chapter in fragments of one to five verses, many times saying the same thing again and again. The same applies to story of Musa (Mosses), Esa (Jesus), Nouh (Noah)...etc. Then come the fact we regularly need to go to Fqah and Ishtihad (Islamic researchers) to answer questions that the Quran did not explain. When you ask how come Allah did not put this in the Quran to us all to see, the answer is ""there was no space"". At the time, I accepted this as a fair argument. But when I read the Quran, I could not believe how much it repeats the same statements again and again that it goes beyond emphasis to becoming a filler words."	1
160	Muhammad did not come up with new teachings of Islam. Independent historians can see that Islam is based on the religion of Judaism, Christianity, and Zoroastrianism. The first two have lived along side Muslims and mostly did not convert to Islam willingly, why? They can see serious contradictions in how Muhammad narrated key stories of Mary's father being called Imran (Muhammad confused her with another Mary in the Bible) and accusing Jews to worship a Rabbi, which is not true. And historians can also see identical baraq story with Zoroastrians where their prophet flew to the 7th heaven to negotiate god about prayers, were in their religions, straight path, heaven, fire, and the eyes of Hadi.	1
161	Muhammad robbed and pillaged traveling merchants. He stole from the Quraysh tribe by conducting 29 of the 69 raids against passing Quraysh caravans in the desert - stealing their money.	1
162	In light of the above-mentioned facts, itÂs clear that there are certain rules and criteria that govern relationships between Muslims and non-Muslims, and this should be borne in mind when dealing with non-Muslims. Islam does not order Muslims to show hostility to the followers of other religions, merely for the reason that they happen to be non-Muslims. No, this is not the message of Islam. Only those who harbour hatred and contempt against Muslims are the ones addressed by the verses warning Muslims from taking them as allies. Other than those, Muslims are ordered to deal with all human beings, without discrimination as to race, religion or sex, with love and kindness, for they are all members of the same family of mankind.	0

Is your mother still alive?Â I said: ÂYes.Â He said: ÂGo back and honor her.Â Then I approached him from the other side and said: ÂO Messenger of Allah, I want to go for Jihad with you, seeking thereby the Face of Allah and the Hereafter.Â He said: ÂWoe to you! Is your mother still alive?Â I said: ÂYes.Â He said: ÂGo back and honour her.Â Then I approached him from in front and said: ÂO Messenger of Allah, I want to go for Jihad with you, seeking thereby the Face of Allah and the Hereafter.Â He said: ÂWoe to you! Is your mother still alive?Â I said: ÂYes.Â He said: ÂGo back and serve her, for there is Paradise.	0

The Jews were collected and the Prophet said (to them), ""I am going to ask you a question. Will you tell the truth?"" They said, ""Yes."" The Prophet asked, ""Who is your father?"" They replied, ""So-and-so."" He said, ""You have told a lie; your father is so-and-so."" They said, ""You are right."" He said, ""Will you now tell me the truth, if I ask you about something?"" They replied, ""Yes, O Abu Al-Qasim; and if we should tell a lie, you can realize our lie as you have done regarding our father."" On that he asked, ""Who are the people of the (Hell) Fire?"" They said, ""We shall remain in the (Hell) Fire for a short period, and after that you will replace us."" The Prophet said, ""You may be cursed and humiliated in it! By Allah, we shall never replace you in it."" Then he asked, ""Will you now tell me the truth if I ask you a question?"" They said, ""Yes, O Abu Al-Qasim."" He asked, ""Have you poisoned this sheep?"" They said, ""Yes."" He asked, ""What made you do so?""

166	It was narrated from 'Aishah: A girl came to her and said: 'My father married me to his brother's son so that he might raise his own status thereby, and I was unwilling.' She said: 'Sit here until the Prophet comes.' Then the Messenger of Allah came, and I told him (what she had said). He sent word to her father, calling him, and he left the matter up to her. She said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I accept what my father did, but I wanted to know whether women have any say in the matter.	0

168	Prior to the advent of Islam, female infanticide was practiced by the Arabs. Islam not only succeeded in uprooting this evil practice by declaring it to be murder, but also ended the prevalent notion that the birth of a girl was not as auspicious as the birth of a boy. Islam teaches that the birth of any child is a great blessing. Islam does not prohibit women seeking work; indeed, in the ideal Islamic society it is necessary that women should fill certain posts. It follows therefore that women need to have the education and the training necessary to take up such important professions as teaching, medicine, and nursing.	0

174	Ibn 'Abbas reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) went out on the day of Adha or Fitr and observed two rak'ahs, and did not observe prayer (at that place) before and after that. He then came to the women along with Bilal and commanded them to give alms and the women began to give their rings and necklaces.

175	And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period, do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands, if they mutually agree on reasonable basis.

176	Muhammad falsely accused the Jewish tribes in Medina of wrongdoings in order to drive them out of Medina and Arabia. He accused them of aiding and abetting several onslaughts of the Quraysh tribe into Medina when, in actual fact, they did not. All three tribes of the Jews were either eliminated or expelled one by one. Banu Qainuqa - expelled. Banu Nader - expelled. Banu Qurayza - all men of the tribe, beheaded.	1
177	In Islam there is absolutely no difference between men and women as far as their relationship with God is concerned, as both are promised the same reward for good conduct and the same punishment for evil conduct. The QurÂan, in addressing the believers, often uses the expression Âbelieving men and womenÂ to emphasize the equality of men and women in regard to their respective duties, rights, virtues and merits. It says: ÂO ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness, that ye may Take away part of the dower ye have given them,-except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and God brings about through it a great deal of goodÂ. Surah 4 Verse 19 The Prophet of Islam, peace be upon him, said: ÂWomen are the twin halves of men.Â ÂFor Muslim men and women,- for believing men and women, for devout men and women, for true men and women, for men and women who are patient and constant, for men and women who humble themselves, for men and women who give in Charity, for men and women who fast (and deny themselves), for men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and women who engage much in GodÂs praise,- for them has God prepared forgiveness and great rewardÂ. Surah 33 Verse 35. This clearly contradicts the assertion of some of the Christian Fathers that women do not possess souls and that they will exist as sexless beings in the next life! The QurÂan says that women have souls in exactly the same way as men and will enter Paradise if they simply do good: ÂWhoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has Faith, verily, to him will We give a new Life, a life that is good and pure and We will bestow on such their reward according to the best of their actionsÂ. Surah 16 Verse 97.	0

That this skydaddy picked up some dust/clay and said: be a man! And this sky daddy who made a universe full of billions and billions of galaxies, within each galaxy millions of stars and billion of planets...out of nothing and pointless as we are nothing here in comparison...still this sky daddy who created all this from nothing..needed a man's rib to create this man someone to ""keep him company!""

181	Narrated Anas: A young Jew became ill. The Prophet went to visit him. He sat down by his head and said to him: Accept Islam.

So he accepted Islam, and the Prophet stood up saying: Praise be to Allah Who has saved him through me from Hell	0
182	"This is among many thing that are ridiculous in the faith. Now few translators struggled with the suggestion that the Quran says ""she said"" ???? which is the exact translation.

Apologists have tried hard to invent explanations, including linking to research that suggests ants communicate...and we have no problem with that...ants do use chemicals to communicate...but they do not have vocals to talk and specifically to say something like ""Solomon and his armies do not crush you..."" Absolute bullshit!! This and a flying donkey buraq, the splitting of the moon that no one saw, man made of clay and woman from his ribs, earth made four days before the sun and the universe, the many scientific errors in the Quran, the immoral hadith, women rights, and Muhammad's life that is anything but an example for all of us!!

And whosoever disbelieves in the Oneness of Allah and in all the other Articles of Faith [i.e. His (AllahÂs), Angels, His Holy Books, His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainments)], then fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers	0
185	It appears that Muhammad had some sort of an animosity towards women. In fact, he believed that women are an evil omen. His extremely superstitious attitude shows that his previous pagan background still influenced his thinking even after he became a Prophet. In Islam, the majority of women will end up in ÂHellÂ simply for being born as a woman.	1
186	How can a god who claim to be, Muslims claim Allah knows best, but in reality Allah knows nothing!	1
187	Sahih al-Bukharis are the strong hadiths, as Muslims very well know. Muhammad was bewitched and under the influence of magic. He imagined things that hadnÂt happened. Aisha proved this in several hadiths. How can Muslims trust that what he said was true? How can Muslims trust that what Muhammad said about the events in the Cave of Hira were true?	1
188	Allah commands His creatures to have Taqwa of Him by worshipping Him Alone without partners. He also reminds to them of His ability, in that He created them all from a single person, Adam, peace be unto him, (And from him He created his wife) Hawwa' (Eve), who was created from Adam's left rib, from his back while he was sleeping. When Adam woke up and saw Hawwa', he liked her and had affection for her, and she felt the same toward him. And have Taqwa of Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and revere the wombs), protect yourself from Allah by your acts of obedience to Him (Surely, Allah is always watching over you.) means, He watches all your deeds and sees your every circumstance.	0
189	Ibn Mas'ud (RAA) narrated, l asked the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) Which sin is the most serious? He replied, attribute a partner to Allah, though He Alone has created you. I asked, What next? He said, kill your child, fearing that he will share your food with you. I asked again, What next? He said, To commit adultery with your neighborÂs wife.	0
190	And divorced women shall wait (as regards their marriage) for three menstrual periods, and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses, etc.) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect, etc.) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise	0
191	"(And marry not women whom your fathers married,) Allah prohibits marrying the women whom the father married, in honor and respect to the fathers, not allowing their children to have sexual relations with their wives after they die. A woman becomes ineligible for the son of her husband as soon as the marriage contract is conducted, and there is a consensus on this ruling. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, ""During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people used to prohibit what Allah prohibits (concerning marriage), except marrying the stepmother and taking two sisters as rival wives, (Indeed it was shameful and Maqtan, and an evil way.)

193	[As for such (non-Muslims) who do not fight you on account of (your) faith, or drive you forth from your homelands, God does not forbid you to show them kindness (also love and respect) and to deal with them with equity, for God loves those who act equitably. God only forbids you to turn in friendship towards such as fight against you because of (your) faith and drive you forth from your homelands or aid (others) in driving you forth. As for those from among you who turn towards them for alliance, it is they who are wrongdoers.] (Al-Mumtahanah 60:8-9) This verse makes it a MuslimÂs duty to treat peacefully coexisting persons with equity (qist) and birr. The term birr and its derivatives are the same expressions used in the QurÂan and Hadith to refer to oneÂs relationship with his or her parents. Such a relationship is more than kindness, since it includes also love and respect. Many English translations of the QurÂan have translated this QurÂanic term as kindness, a translation that falls short of the richer meaning of the original Arabic term. To ameliorate this problem, the bracketed statement (also love and respect) was added above. The term qist has been translated as Âjustice.Â Justice, however, is closest to another Arabic word `adl. This word, however, refers to giving the other his or her rights, no less and no more. Other scholars argue that the QurÂanic term qist means Âgoing beyond justice by giving more than what is due to others.Â	0
194	I have been accused of worshipping the devil! As an atheist I do not believe the devil is real. To suggest that any true atheists worship the devil is stupid. To believe in the devil is to believe there is a god in the first place. Those who do claim to worship devil, are rebellious idiots who probably do believe in a god but angry with him. I am not angry, I just see facts. The devil (like the jins) made up scarecrow to frighten people. In fact, Jins are an Arabian pagan myth that Muhammad copied. There is no record of Jins in all of the so called Heavenly books that supposedly the same god sent. Absolutely nothing in the Torah or Bible. When I grow up, I am supposed to realise the boogeyman is made up story invented by adults to keep us behaved... Not for the 1.5 billion people in blind faith.	1
195	There is almost nothing original in Islam. Islam is just a combination of borrowed practices from other religions. If Muhammad wanted that practice into his newly founded religion, all he needed to do was to claim a certain righteous or religious figure did it, providing no prove whatsoever for his claim.	1
196	 And as for women past child-bearing who do not expect wed-lock, it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment. But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.	0
197	Allah commands you as regards your childrenÂs (inheritance); to the male, a portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, two or more, their share is two thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers or (sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are nearest to you in benefit, (these fixed shares) are ordained by Allah. And Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.	0
198	The right of a woman as a mother: In Islamic law, the mother has a supreme position that is not matched by any other position, for God Almighty has commanded her to be kind to her, and made that coupled with a great command, which is monotheism.  The Almighty said: (And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you be kind to your parents. Many, for example: ÂOn the authority of Abu Hurairah, he said: A man came to the Messenger of God, may GodÂs prayers and peace be upon him, and said: Who is the most deserving of people to my good companionship? He said: Your mother, he said: Then who? He said: Then your mother, He said: Then who? He said: Then your mother. He said: Then who? He said: Then your father.	0
199	"When Muhammad migrated to Madina, failed to convert the big Jewish tribes - despite his best efforts. But he has built up an extensive army. In that time, the Quran tune changed completely to "" Muslims have to do this and that, don't drink, do not mix with none believers... AND you kuffar are all bastards, either you convert or I will kill you and Allah will stick you like a kabab and fry you... etc"". These became known as Meccian verses and Madina verses. We have our own theory here. Muhammad in Mecca was relying on what he learned from his maternal uncle Waraqah Ibn Nawfal, a priest in Christianity and Judaism, to invent verses in the Quran. But in Madina Muhammad was on his own and making up his own material. What changed between Mecca and Medina that Allah's *language and style* of writing would change!!! "	1
200	 But if you intend to replace a wife by another and you have given one of them a Cantar (of gold i.e. a great amount) as Mahr, take not the least bit of it back; would you take it wrongfully without a right and (with) a manifest sin?	0
201	"Was Muhammad a womaniser? Absolutely, many Muslim men acknowledge that. Was he a corrupted politician and writing the Quran himself? Let's see. Muhammad was supposedly a humble messenger of Allah. To follow everything Allah told him to do. But when Allah said maximum of four wives, Muhammad had at the time of this story 9 wives, many concubines, and still to Aisha shock, Muhammad was sleeping with any Muslim woman who came along and offered herself to him in ""marriage"", even without the approval of a guardian. So Aysha kick up a fuss with Muhammad, like what the hell!! But next day ""Allah"" responded with an out of jail card that says Muhammad is free to sleep with any woman he likes... Subhan Allah. Can you guess what Aisha response was, ""I feel that your Lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires."""	1
202	I would particularly like to make it clear that the QurÂan does not instruct Muslims to kill non-believers to guarantee them a place in Heaven, as you have said. On the contrary, God commands the believers to invite others to His way in the most peaceful manner. In this call, the Muslims are commanded to appeal to their common sense and to their own faith in truth and justice. Most certainly God has categorically prohibited forcing anyone to accept Islam, let alone killing! 	0
203	The pattern of violence and aggressive disregard for human suffering that is persistent in Muslim history and contemporary attitude toward non-believers reflects the message of the Quran, which is one of group superiority and arrogance.	1
204	There are many fascinating Fairy Tales in the QurÂan. However, we will leave this intriguing tale for another time and concentrate on something closer to earth. We must admit that if not for the blood-spilling verses, the QurÂan would top GrimmÂs Fairy Tales. It will certainly be acclaimed as one of the best bed-time stories for children. One Fairy Tale  that is sure to fascinate children will be the story of ÂAllah in Wonderland.Â LetÂs begin. Once upon a timeÂ	1
205	And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period, either take them back on reasonable basis or set them free on reasonable basis. But do not take them back to hurt them, and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself. And treat not the Verses (Laws) of Allah as a jest, but remember AllahÂs Favours on you (i.e. Islam), and that which He has sent down to you of the Book (i.e. the QurÂan) and Al-Hikmah (the ProphetÂs Sunnah Â legal ways Â Islamic jurisprudence, etc.) whereby He instructs you. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is All-Aware of everything.	0
206	It may be noted that Âturning awayÂ from this invitation is not presented as a punishable offense in this life, and that the consequence of rejection is to simply testify MuslimsÂ submission to Allah. Another verse in the QurÂan encourages peaceful dialogue and invites all to build upon the common ground between Muslims and the People of the Book. The QurÂan instructs Muslims: [And do not argue with the People of Book except in a most kindly manner, except for those of them who are bent on evildoing, and say: ÂWe believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which has come down to you; our Lord and yours is One and it is to Him that we (all) submit ourselves.Â] (Al-`Ankabut 29:46) Not only do Muslims, Christians, and Jews share belief in the One God and divine revelation, they also share belief in human responsibility, consequences of good and evil deeds, moral teachings, and other values such as love, peace, and justice.	0
207	It is obvious that Islam cannot be the religion of the true God. IslamÂs origin began on the foundation of violence. Yes, the reason Muslims kill with an untroubled conscience is because they reflect the same murderous spirit as the deity they worship. If you think Islamic terrorism is a new phenomenon, think again. The success of Islam came through terrorism. I am not the ones saying this. The prophet of Islam himself boastfully admitted to this fact.	1
208	The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: He who believes in Allah and the last Day should not harm his neighbor; and take my advice regarding good treatment of women, for they were created from a rib. And indeed the most crooked part of the rib is its upper part. If you attempt to straighten it, you will break it, and if you leave it alone it will remain crooked. So, take my advice regarding good treatment of women.	0
209	The Prophet started preaching Islam in Makkah, being only one man in the midst of all those polytheists. How could he convert all those supporters to make Arabia almost completely Muslim, if his policy had been killing non-Muslims?! He was not a king or a ruler; but he became the unquestioned ruler of Arabia; and every letter of the Book of God he gave them became law. Was it out of the fear of being killed that all those non-Muslims embraced Islam? And would it have been possible ever since for his religion to be continuously gaining over Christianity, which is originally a religion of mercy, unless people have seen in Islam an ever-greater mercy? The point is that it was not the religion of Moses or Jesus Christ that Muhammad was trying to replace. It was the misinterpretations and the distortions that happened to their religion that Muhammad wanted to replace, back to their original authentic teachings. In fact, his mission was to restore the pure religion of Noah, Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus (peace be upon them all). The Islamic view of the earlier religions is clear from the following verses of the QurÂan, Surah 42, verses 13 Â 15: *{He has made plain to you of the religion what He enjoined upon Nuh (Noah) and that which We have revealed to you and that which We enjoined upon Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus) that keep to obedience and be not divided therein; hard to the unbelievers is that which you call them to; Allah chooses for Himself whom He pleases, and guides to Himself him who turns [to Him], frequently. And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them out of envy among themselves; and had not a word gone forth from your Lord till an appointed term, certainly judgment would have been given between them; and those who were made to inherit the Book after them are most surely in disquieting doubt concerning it. To this then go on inviting, and go on steadfastly on the right way as you are commanded, and do not follow their low desires, and say: I believe in what Allah has revealed of the Book, and I am commanded to do justice between you: Allah is our Lord and your Lord; we shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds; no plea need there be [now] between us and you: Allah will gather us together, and to Him is the return.}* If these are the teachings of the Holy QurÂan, how can anyone believe that it dictated Muslims to kill non-Muslims?! It is true that God in His Book permits fighting, but only as a last resort. This is in the cases of: Â Fighting in the case of self-defense. Â Fighting to defend the right of everyone to believe in God and practice His religion. Â Fighting against brutal oppression and injustice.	0

211	The key verses in the QurÂan concerning the justification of resorting to combative jihad are the following: [And fight in GodÂs cause against those who wage war against you, but do not commit aggression, for, verily, Allah does not love the aggressors. And slay them wherever you may come upon them, and drive them away from wherever they drove you away, for oppression is even worse than killing. And fight not against them near the Sacred Mosque until they fight against you first, but if they fight against you, slay them: such is the recompense of the rejecters of truth. But if they desist (from aggression), behold, Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful. And fight against them until there is no more oppression and religion belongs to God (i.e. until people can worship Allah without fear of persecution), but if they desist, then all hostility shall cease, except against those who commit injustice.] (Al-Baqarah 2:190-194). It is obvious from these key verses that the only two justifications of the combative-type of jihad are to stop aggression and severe oppression. The condition for ceasing hostilities is not acceptance of Islam, but halt to aggression and oppression. Like the above verses, there are a few verses in the QurÂan which sanction fighting. These verses, however, when understood in their textual and historical context deal with war situations and should not be generalized. The description of the aggressors or oppressors as rejecters of faith or idolatrous people does not mean that they are to be fought against on account of being non-Muslims. Historically, these aggressors happened to be non-Muslims. In fact, the QurÂan allows fighting against fellow Muslims if they are aggressors and other means of restoring peace and justice have failed (Al-Hujurat 49:8-9). The issue is allowing fighting in the presence of aggression, not difference of religion.	0
212	"Time for mental gymmastics to try to ""fix"" this verse! But wait, it is clear in black and white, making a ridiculous claim! But in the days of Muhammad, he could make any claim from the desert of Arabia and people who never went far enough north or south simply believed him. Also, did you know is that this is the same region that regularly have to pray Allah for rain!  Prayer does not work, better water management and innovation in extracting water would work."	1
213	And among the rights of girls is also justice, which is what Islam has approved, as the Sunnah has commanded justice in children.

215	"Abdools, do you know your prophet died with an erection? How humiliating is that? But makes sense for such a vile indecent man to go out that way. From all the fornication, adultery, pedophilia and rapes he committed this was a great way for him to be humiliated for all the humiliation he caused to others! Ibn Hisham observed, ÂThe apostleÂs body did not present the appearance of an ordinary corpse.Â (pg. 688) Aisha also noted that If she had known beforehand what she found out later, ""none would have washed him except his wives"". Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: [...]Aisha used to say: If I had known beforehand about my affair what I found out later, none would have washed him except his wives. Sunan Abu Dawud 20:3135 Abu al-Fida (1273 Â 1331 AD) was a Muslim geographer and historian. He relates that Muhammad suffered from a death erection.

Al Jannabi (Gagmer, tom. iii. p. 487) records his own testimony that he surpassed all men in conjugal vigour; and Abulfeda mentions the exclamation of Ali, who washed his body after his death, ÂO propheta, certe penis tuus cÃ¦lum versus erectus estÂ (in Vit. Mohammed. p. 140). Edward Gibbon's ""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"" Vol. 9 - Footnote 175 In English, Ali had exclaimed, ""O prophet, thy penis is erect unto the sky!"""	1

When the Prophet went out, he was reciting this Ayah, (and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice.) commanding justice when judging between people. Muhammad bin Ka`b, Zayd bin Aslam and Shahr bin Hawshab said; ""This Ayah was revealed about those in authority'', meaning those who judge between people. (Verily, how excellent is the teaching which He (Allah) gives you!) meaning, His commands to return the trusts to their owners, to judge between people with justice, and all of His complete, perfect and great commandments and laws.

And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you (go in unto them in any manner as long as it is in their vagina). Truly, Allah loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves those who purify themselves (by taking a bath and cleaning and washing thoroughly their private parts, bodies, for their prayers, etc.)	0

224	"How Islamic ""scientists"" defend Mohammed's #pedophilia and blame the west for those who do what Mohammed did. #Fatwa committee says, Muhammad's thigh sex with baby Aisha shows his amazing sexual self restrain. We should all condemn these sexual crimes on women; save children & women from Islam. ""THIGHING"" AISHA. A honest enquiry from a Muhammadan:Praise be to Allah and peace be upon the one after whom there is no [further] prophet. After the permanent committee for the scientific research and fatwahs (religious decrees) reviewed the question presented to the grand Mufti Abu Abdullah Muhammad Al-Shemary, the question forwarded to the committee by the grand scholar of the committee with reference number 1809 issued on 3/8/1421 (Islamic calendar corresponding to 30/10/2000). The inquirer asked the following: It has become wide spread these days, and especially during weddings, the habit of mufaÂkhathat of the children (mufaÂkhathat literally translated means ""placing between the thighs"" which means placing the male member between the thighs of a child). What is the opinion of scholars knowing full well that the prophet, the peace and prayer of Allah be upon him, also practiced the ""thighing"" of Aisha - the mother of believers - may Allah be please with her. After the committee studied the issue, they gave the following reply: It has not been the practice of the Muslims throughout the centuries to resort to this ""unlawful"" practice that has come to our countries from pornographic movies that the kufar (infidels) and enemies of Islam send. As for the prophet, peace and prayer of Allah be upon him, thighing his fiancÃ©e Aisha. She was six years of age and he could not have intercourse with her due to her small age. That is why [the prophet] peace and prayer of Allah be upon him placed his [male] member between her thighs and massaged it softly, as the apostle of Allah had control of his [male] member not like other believers. Another Fatwa from Islamweb site, now seems to have been deleted: Fatwah 23672: The inquirer asks: ""My parents married me to a young girl who hasn't yet reached puberty. How can I enjoy her sexually?"" The Imam answers him by saying: ""Do not harm her if she cannot take intercourse but you may hug her, kiss her, and ejaculate between her legs"" i.e. ""thigh"" her, as the fatwah in question indicates. Our summary: ""Muhammad placed his penis between the thighs of baby Aisha and he massaged it to orgasm. This continued until Aisha turned 9 and Mohammed eventually raped her (consummated his marriage)"" Our take away: They admit Mohammed thighed Aisha at age 6. They admit Mohammed raped Aisha at age 9 They admit Aisha was a toddler. They called Aisha Mohammed's fiancÃ©e. They called Mohammed's action unlawful. They blamed it on the infidels of today. They blamed it on enemies of Islam. They claim Mohammed controlled his lust.  That's from the permanent committee for the scientific research and fatwahs. How crooked can Islamic scientific research be? !!! Wait.... What?...did I just call it SCIENTIFIC?"	1
225	The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) explained that mercy is not being merciful to oneÂs companions but merciful to all. He also explained, ÂHe who is not merciful to others, will not be treated mercifully.Â It is obvious that Muslims are not the only dwellers of the earth. Hence the command to be merciful applies to all. In fact, mercy applies as well to animals and other creatures of Allah. A logical fruit of this attitude of mercy is to love humankind as persons and fellow honored creatures of Allah, while dissociating oneself from their erroneous beliefs or even rejection of Allah. This love finds its greatest form by loving good and guidance for them. This does not mean loving their wrongdoing or their rejection of faith in Allah. It is the love of their guidance and well being in this life and in the life to come.	0

227	EID AL-ADHA IS ABOUT JESUS, AND MUSLIMS DONÂT KNOW IT, The story of Abraham sacrificing his son is found in both the Bible and the QurÂan. The second holiest holiday in Islam is Eid al-Adha - commemorating this same event.  However, the story as told in the QurÂan lacks the richness and deep meaning found in the Bible.  It leaves the reader wondering why Allah asked Abraham to sacrifice his son - a very odd request.  Furthermore, the QurÂan AGREES with the BIBLE, teaching that Isaac was sacrificed - NOT Ishmael.  So, why do the vast majority of Muslims believe Ishmael was sacrificed?  Muslims may be listening to faulty teaching rather than reading their QurÂan. These are the two main questions: 1. WHO was sacrificed? (Muslims are confused) 2. WHY was he sacrificed? (The QurÂan doesnÂt say) Muslims donÂt know the correct answer to the first question.  The QurÂan cannot answer the second.  Yet, IslamÂs second holiest holiday is based on this event which Muslims donÂt understand. ALLAH COMMANDS MUSLIMS TO ASK CHRISTIANS	1

(Verily, the most honorable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa.) meaning, `you earn honor with Allah the Exalted on account of Taqwa, not family lineage.'

""They are your cover and you are their cover.'' In short, the wife and the husband are intimate and have sexual intercourse with each other, and this is why they were permitted to have sexual activity during the nights of Ramadan, so that matters are made easier for them. Abu Ishaq reported that Al-Bara' bin `Azib said, ""When the Companions of Allah's Messenger observed fast but would sleep before breaking their fast, they would continue fasting until the following night. Qays bin Sirmah Al-Ansari was fasting one day and was working in his land. When the time to break the fast came, he went to his wife and said, `Do you have food' She said, `No. But I could try to get you some.' His eyes then were overcome by sleep and when his wife came back, she found him asleep. She said, `Woe unto you! Did you sleep' In the middle of the next day, he lost consciousness and mentioned what had happened to the Prophet. (Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them). Allah has allowed eating and drinking, along with having sexual intercourse, as we have stated, during any part of the night until the light of dawn is distinguished from the darkness of the night.

At-Tirmidhi recorded it and said, ""Hasan Gharib''. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that `A'ishah said that when Sawdah bint Zam`ah became old, she forfeited her day to `A'ishah, and the Prophet used to spend Sawdah's night with `A'ishah. (And making peace is better). Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah refers to, ""When the husband gives his wife the choice between staying with him or leaving him, as this is better than the husband preferring other wives to her.'' However, the apparent wording of the Ayah refers to the settlement where the wife forfeits some of the rights she has over her husband, with the husband agreeing to this concession, and that this settlement is better than divorce. For instance, the Prophet kept Sawdah bint Zam`ah as his wife after she offered to forfeit her day for `A'ishah. By keeping her among his wives, his Ummah may follow this kind of settlement. Since settlement and peace are better with Allah than parting. (But if you do good and have Taqwa, verily, Allah is Ever Well-Acquainted with what you do) if you are patient with the wife you dislike and treat her as other wives are treated, then Allah knows what you do and will reward you for it perfectly."	0

The Zahiri jurist, said the following: If a dhimmi is threatened by an enemy, it is our obligation to fight the enemy with soldiers and weapons. With this, we will be honouring the Covenant of Allah and His Messenger. To hand him over to the enemy would mean a betrayal of the Covenant of Allah and His Messenger.	0

Then Allah lifted the restriction stated in this Ayah and permitted him to marry more women, but he did not marry anyone else, so that the favor of the Messenger of Allah towards them would be clear. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: ""The Messenger of Allah did not die until Allah permitted (marriage to other) women for him."	0

248	IF MUHAMMAD NEVER OBEYED THE QURAN, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO CONVERT TO ISLAM OR EVEN FOLLOW THE QURAN?	1
249	There is no sin on you, if you divorce women while yet you have not touched (had sexual relation with) them, nor appointed unto them their Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage). But bestow on them ( a suitable gift), the rich according to his means, and the poor according to his means, a gift of reasonable amount is a duty on the doers of good.	0
250	Regarding the subject of killing, it is true that God has permitted fighting; but this fighting must be against oppression and injustice, not against non-Muslims as such! Where innocent men, women and children are attacked, or when intolerable atrocities are committed, Muslims are asked to fight to protect the innocent and safeguard their rights.	0
251	How can Allah make such a mistake? To suggest there is other creators!  Or was it a slip of mind by Muhammad who acknowledged other gods of the desert dwellers? This is one of many contradictions in the Quran. 	1
252	"Muhammad, to frighten even the closest people to him, suggested that Allah knows that is already in people's mind (although the Quran inaccurately keeps says ""what is in their heart"" or what is in the ""chest""). A misconception from the 7th century that believed people think from their heart and chest...why? Because it is there we feel anxiety and love ...failing to realise it is a reaction coming from the brain - again another scientific error."	1
253	Lodge them (the divorced women) where you dwell, according to your means, and do not treat them in such a harmful way that they be obliged to leave. And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they deliver. Then if they give suck to the children for you, give them their due payment, and let each of you accept the advice of the other in a just way. But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may give suck for him (the father of the child).	0
254	Yet another evidence that the author of the Quran is Muhammad. What does the Quran says about heaven? This is 7th century heaven, heaven of things that desert dwellers dreamed off. But that is just boring, how much water, milk, honey, and wine do you want? A 21st century heaven would be, endless supply of electronics, TV streaming with super fast broadband, rivers of vodka, whiskey, or Coca-Cola (or Pepsi)  Heaven would be a place you can transform to be anything you want to be. Fridges with endless supply of cakes and chocolates that don't make you fat. Galactic travel, continuously exploring planets, and different universes, where happiness an endless joy to share. Why Muhammad did not mention any of these? Muhammad was only reflecting what he thought is his heaven.. Including mindless houris women for sex. We scrolled the Quran from cover to cover, nothing specific about what women get in heaven - as if they do not exist. The Quran is man made for men by a desert dweller, do we need to say more. And then they say Atheist leave Islam to follow their sexual gratifications. Now you know why mostly men come here to defend Islam. Little do they know, it was all made up.	1
255	O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife [Hawwa (Eve)], and from them both He created many men and women and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship) . Surely, Allah is Ever an All-Watcher over you	0
256	Islam gave women a variety of rights 1,400 years ago that were not acknowledged in Western countries until the 17th century. According to the Encyclopedia Americana in English Common Law: all the real property held by a woman at the time of her marriage became the property of her husband Â he was entitled to the rent from the land and any profit that might be made from managing it. In Islamic law, women have an unqualified right to own property, a right that does not change on marriage. A woman is also free to dispose of her property, Â bequeath it, rent it, sell it, invest it Â in any way she likes, without consulting any one else.	0
257	Islamic Sharia permitted the treatment of the People of the Book, so it permitted the eating of their slaughtered animals (it is permissible to eat them according to our Sharia), and it permitted the marriage of their women, and the buying and selling of them, as well as justice, righteousness and kindness to them as long as they are not at war.	0
258	"This is what I used to remember hearing during Friday prayers, nearly every week: Islamic Shariah will deliver our utopia. And even then, the suggestion that going back to Shariah Law did not settle well with me. Shariah Law is 7th century justice that is inhumane and does not work. For however good intentions are, we humans make mistakes. And who will judge someone to be a thief, liar, killer, or adulterer? Humans. Our current laws means that if we get it wrong we can set them free from prison and compensate them.This system does not work, and evidence shows that crime rates in civilised countries is low. Shariah is not the way, higher and better education is the way. As much as they try to sell the utopia of Islam, ask yourself...why is it that even Islamic countries do not apply the Shariah in full, even those with ""Islamic"" in their country title? What worries me the most, is the same day burial of the dead. I understand the historical need when we did not have fridges. But anyone who watched CSI or study criminology would guess that thousands of cases in the Arab and Islamic world must be going unsolved. From poisonings to suffocation, and by the time anyone has raised concerns, the body had gone! Islam is not prefect, it was designed for 7th century Arabia and it is not fit for purpose."	1
259	O Prophet ()! When you divorce women, divorce them at their ÂIddah (prescribed periods), and count (accurately) their ÂIddah (periods ). And fear Allah your Lord (O Muslims), and turn them not out of their (husbandÂs) homes, nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in case they are guilty of some open illegal sexual intercourse. And those are the set limits of Allah. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah, then indeed he has wronged himself. You (the one who divorces his wife) know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass (i.e. to return her back to you if that was the first or second divorce).	0
260	"How can Allah make such a mistake? To suggest there is other creators! Or was is a slip of mind by Muhammad who acknowledged other gods of the desert dwellers This is one of many contradictions in the Quran.  It is from a similar verse, that Muhammad accidentally acknowledged that Allah has female goddesses, which what pagan Arabs believed in. The verse is said to have been revealed during a heavy debate with pagan Arabs. Later, Muhammad realised that acknowledging additional gods would put him at odds with his Christians and Jews. He claimed, that this revelation, was not from angel Gabriel but the devil deceived him into thinking he was talking to angel Gabriel. It is from this that the book ""Satanic Verses"" by Salman Rushdie came about. The reaction and backlash to it amazing. Why? What is the big deal? The book is based on a factual even that is well documented in Islamic sources - albeit, we avoid talking about it. Go ahead, ask your sheikh next time : What is the story of satanic verses that confused Muhammad? And sit back and admire how ridiculous the story sounds."	1
261	The compilation of the Qur'an was clearly a very human process involving trial and error, educated guesses, faulty memories, fallible opinions, disagreements, mistakes, ignorance, and bad decisions. And we can't forget, of course, the pile of manuscripts reduced to ashes by Uthman in his desperate attempt to destroy all evidence that the Qur'an hadn't been perfectly preserved. The early Muslim community left modern Muslims with a huge mess to clean up if they want to cling to the belief that the Qur'an was perfectly preserved as you can see in this hadith.	1
262	This brings us to the questions that may naturally arise when one reads the misconceptions and distorted image, which some missionaries repeat in order to make people shy away from Islam. One may wonder what the grounds for so much of animosity are. In fact there are a few reasons: Islam is the only religion that has come up after Christianity, posing a real challenge to its supremacy. Only Islam has questioned the basic tenets of Christianity, such as the Trinity, the divinity of Jesus and his atoning death on the cross. In the past centuries, wherever there was a confrontation between Islam and Christianity at the ideological level, it was mostly Islam that has won. In the contemporary world, even by conservative estimates, Islam is gaining over Christianity as the fastest growing religion. The enemies of Islam imagine that the tide in favor of Islam can be reversed by certain concerted efforts on their side.	0
263	"For a religion that claims to be ""prefect"" and most ""peaceful"" one would have expected out extremist to be extremely prefect and extremely peaceful...and the minute you ask that question and realise how stupid it is...the sooner you start your journey out of Islam! #ISIS don't understand Islam, #Bokoharam does not understand Islam, #AlQaida does not understand Islam, #Taliban does not understand Islam, the #Wahhabis do not understand Islam, Muslim #Brotherhood does not understand Islam, Iran and Hizbullab do not understand Islam, individual terrorist who pick up Islam on their own (or get radicalised in ever different ways) do not understand Islam.....how long do we need to keep going before you realise there is no other religion in the WORLD that has this long list of people who do NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR RELIGION to the extend that they commit genocides and terrorism! So stop being a ridiculous apologist and look at the verses we are showing that shows the Quran NEVER once says love the others but has tons of verses that says hate, fight, jihad, and kill ...and as such this cannot be a religion of peace or perfect!"	1
264	"The Wives of the Prophet are not like Other Women: This Ayah is addressed to the wives of the Prophet who chose Allah and His Messenger and the Home of the Hereafter, and remained married to the Messenger of Allah . Thus it was befitting that there should be rulings which applied only to them, and not to other women, in the event that any of them should commit open Fahishah. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: ""This means Nushuz (rebellion) and a bad attitude.'' Whatever the case, this is a conditional phrase and it does not imply that what is referred to would actually happen."	0
265	Umm Salama said she asked GodÂs messenger whether she would have a reward for what she spent on Abu SalamaÂs sons, for they were only her sons, and he replied, Spend on them and you will have the reward for what you spend on them.	0
266	This means that forcing people to believe in God runs against His decree of free will, which includes the fact that some will reject Him. The ultimate reward or punishment for accepting or rejecting belief in God is deferred until the Day of Judgment. This value inculcates the attitude of being non-judgmental and accepting of people as they are, human beings entitled to choose and who are answerable to their Creator. Acceptance of plurality does not mean accepting the plurality of ultimate truths, nor does it preclude sharing oneÂs faith with others and even inviting them to it. Plurality means peaceful coexistence with those who hold differing beliefs and convictions. Prohibition of compulsion in faith: Sharing or propagating faith is not the same as compulsion in religion. The QurÂan makes it a duty on believers to communicate the message of Islam to fellow humans and to be witnesses to humankind. [And thus We (Allah) made of you (O Muslims) a justly balanced community that you might bear witness (to the truth) to humankind and the Apostle might bear witness over you.] (Al-Baqarah 2:143).	0
267	This Islamic doctrine can easily lead to the abuse of the marriage institution. Essentially, this Islamic rule turns wives into nothing more than prostitutes. This is shown in the life of Hassan, a grandson of Muhammad. Hassan, over the course of his life, had over three-hundred wives, yet never exceeded the four-wife limit at any one time. He would marry a woman during the day, enjoy her company for one or a few nights, and then divorce her so that he could marry another, all within the bounds of Islamic law. In Islam, a man is free to divorce his wife for a reason or for no reason and at any time he wishes. The above QurÂanic text clearly demonstrates that according to the laws of Allah, a wife is like a piece of purchased merchandise that a husband can easily replace. The above Islamic rulings are the true authentic teachings of Allah and his Prophet as it is taught in the QurÂan. But today, we may find laws on marriage and divorce that are more merciful and reasonable in some Islamic countries. These laws are often passed off as the true teachings of Islam. This is a blatant lie. For example, some Muslim governments have enacted laws that require a husband to seek permission from his wife before marrying another. There is no such clause in the QurÂan. According to the written law of Allah, a Muslim man simply has the right to add or replace one wife with another.	1
268	It is He Who has created you from a single person (Adam), and (then) He has created from him his wife [Hawwa (Eve)], in order that he might enjoy the pleasure of living with her. When he had sexual relation with her, she became pregnant and she carried it about lightly. Then when it became heavy, they both invoked Allah, their Lord (saying): ÂIf You give us a Salih (good in every aspect) child, we shall indeed be among the grateful.	0
269	"(Lodge them where you dwell,) means, with you, (according to what you have,) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others said, it refers to ""Your ability.'' Qatadah said, ""If you can only afford to accommodate her in a corner of your house, then do so.'' (and do not harm them in order to suppress them.) Muqatil bin Hayyan said, ""meaning, do not annoy her to force her to pay her way out nor expel her from your house. (And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden.) This is about the woman who is irrevocably divorced. If she is pregnant, then she is to be spent on her until she lays down her burden. This is supported due to the fact that if she is revocably divorced, the she has then right to receive her support (maintenance) whether she is pregnant or not. (Then if they suckle them for you,) meaning, when pregnant women give birth and they are irrevocably divorced by the expiration of the `Iddah, then at that time they may either suckle the child or not. But that is only after she nourishes him with the milk, that is the early on milk which the infant's well-being depends upon. Then, if she suckles, she has the right to compensation for it. She is allowed to enter into a contract with the father or his representative in return for whatever payment they agree to. (and let each of you deal with each other in a mannerly way.) meaning, the affairs of the divorced couple should be managed in a just way without causing harm to either one of them, (But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him.) meaning, if the divorced couple disagrees, because the woman asks for an unreasonable fee for suckling their child, and the father refuses to pay the amount or offers an unreasonable amount, he may find another woman to suckle his child. If the mother agrees to accept the amount that was to be paid to the woman who agreed to suckle the child, then she has more right to suckle her own child."	0
270	Despite being a relatively small book, the Quran contains unnecessary repitition. Why would God waste space saying essentially the same thing about something obscure when he could have offered clear moral principles about peace, tolerance (or a law against sex with children)?	1
271	Incidentally, a Muslim woman is not required to change her maiden name on marriage, she retains her own name, a symbolic demonstration of the fact that even on marriage, Islam recognizes her independent legal personality. It was not until the late 1870s onwards in England (and even later elsewhere in Europe) that married women achieved the right to enter contracts and own property. In France, these same rights were not recognized until 1938.	0
272	Muslims often brag that Islam honors and elevates women. However, in reality the opposite is true. Lies can be told, but evidence will always show up bearing the truth. And the truth is Islam oppresses and humiliates women. In this article, we will discuss a list of the ten most evil commandments of Allah. These commandments show how women are viewed and treated in Islam. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief summary on each of the evil commandments of Allah regarding women. This will enable the readers to have an overview of the evil teachings of Islam concerning women. This article is dedicated to women all over the world. It is dedicated to our mothers, sisters, wives and daughters.	1
273	"Allah mentions the blessing He has bestowed upon His servant by giving them mates from among themselves, mates of their own kind. If He had given them mates of another kind, there would be no harmony, love and mercy between them. But out of His mercy He has made the Children of Adam male and female, and has made the females wives or mates for the males. Then Allah mentions that from these wives He creates children and grandchildren, one's children's children. (Allah will say to His servant on the Day of Resurrection, reminding him of His blessings: ""Did I not give you a wife Did I not honor you Did I not subject horses and camels to your use, and cause you to occupy a position of leadership and honor'')"	0
274	How can there be a covenant with Allah and with His Messenger for the Mushrikun (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) except those with whom you made a covenant near Al-Masjid-al-Haram (at Makkah)? So long, as they are true to you, stand you true to them. Verily, Allah loves Al-Muttaqun 	0
275	"(Men are the protectors and maintainers of women,) meaning, the man is responsible for the woman, and he is her maintainer, caretaker and leader who disciplines her if she deviates. (because Allah has made one of them to excel the other,) meaning, because men excel over women and are better than them for certain tasks. This is why prophethood was exclusive of men, as well as other important positions of leadership. (and because they spend from their means.) meaning the dowry, expenditures and various expenses that Allah ordained in His Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger for men to spend on women. For these reasons it is suitable that he is appointed her maintainer. (Therefore, the righteous) women, (are Qanitat), obedient to their husbands, (and guard in the husband's absence) As-Suddi and others said that it means she protects her honor and her husband's property when he is absent, (what Allah orders them to guard.) means, the protected ?husband? is the one whom Allah protects. (As to those women on whose part you see ill conduct,) meaning, the woman from whom you see ill conduct with her husband, such as when she acts as if she is above her husband, disobeys him, ignores him, dislikes him, and so forth. When these signs appear in a woman, her husband should advise her and remind her of Allah's torment if she disobeys him. Indeed, Allah ordered the wife to obey her husband and prohibited her from disobeying him, because of the enormity of his rights and all that he does for her. (As to those women on whose part you see ill conduct, admonish them (first)), (abandon them in their beds,) Ibn `Abbas said ""The abandonment refers to not having intercourse with her, to lie on her bed with his back to her.'' Several others said similarly. Ibn `Abbas, in another narration, added, ""Not to speak with her or talk to her.'' Mu`awiyah bin Haydah Al-Qushayri said, ""O Allah's Messenger! What is the right that the wife of one of us has on him''. (beat them) means, if advice and ignoring her in the bed do not produce the desired results, you are allowed to discipline the wife, without severe beating. Muslim recorded that Jabir said that during the Farewell Hajj, (but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance),) meaning, when the wife obeys her husband in all that Allah has allowed, then no means of annoyance from the husband are allowed against his wife. Therefore, in this case, the husband does not have the right to beat her or shun her bed. Allah's statement, (Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great.) reminds men that if they transgress against their wives without justification, then Allah, the Ever Most High, Most Great, is their Protector, and He will exert revenge on those who transgress against their wives and deal with them unjustly."	0
276	QurÂanic Foundations of Muslim/Non-Muslim Relations It should be noted from the beginning that the very term Islam implies that peace is the basis and the norm of Muslim/non-Muslim relations. Islam is derived from the Arabic root S-L-M, whose generic meaning includes the concepts of peace and submission. From a spiritual perspective, Islam may be defined as attaining peace through submission to Allah or the state of peace in submission to Allah. Ample references in the QurÂan and Hadith reveal that this concept of peace embraces peace with God, inner peace as a result of that relationship with God, peace with humans, peace with the animal world, peace with vegetation, and peace with the ecological order.	0
277	Verily! Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due; and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice. Verily, how excellent is the teaching which He (Allah) gives you! Truly, Allah is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer	0
278	"Yahya related to me the like of that from Malik from Ibn Shihab. Malik said, about a slave who divorced a slave-girl but did not make it absolute, ""He can return to her. If he then dies while she is still in the idda from her divorce, she does the idda of a slave-girl whose husband dies, and it is two months and five days. If she has been set free and he can return to her, and she does not choose to separate after she has been set free, and he dies while she is in the idda from the divorce, she does the idda of a free woman whose husband has died, four months and ten days. That is because the idda of widowhood befell her while she was free, so her idda is the idda of a free woman. Malik said, That is what is done among us."	0
279	All Muslim terrorists kill for the same reason the Saudi terrorists did on 9/11, the same reason ISIS  killed, raped and enslaved whole communities of Yazidis in Iraq, the same reason Boko Haram is killing Christians in North Eastern Nigeria, the same reason Muhammad waged wars against non Muslims in and out of Medina. The reason? The Islamic Quran commands it.  Allah commands it.	1
280	And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husbandÂs part, there is no sin on them both if they make terms of peace between themselves; and making peace is better. And human inner-selves are swayed by greed. But if you do good and keep away from evil, verily, Allah is Ever Well-Acquainted with what you do.	0
281	"Jezia is in effect a discrimination tax.How would you feel if the EU, USA, Canada, or Australia introduces tax to be paid by non-Christians for ""protection!"" Is the Jezya similar to taxes we see today? Under Islamic rule, believers pay the Zakat, a 5% on income, which is ""wajib"" as in required the same way praying and fasting. There is no clear penalty to it other than you will be punished in the judgement day. The Jezya could be as much as 50% of income. Omar set the bar at one gold coin per person per year, which was huge amount of money at the time. What would happen if you cannot pay it? Your tribe will be taken over, your women and girls taken Sabaya (sex slaves and maids), boys sold as slave boys, and men and elderly killed. So, no. It is not the same!! Can you imagine the EU, USA, Canada, India or Australia non-Christian tax like the Islamic one? You would cry out discrimination, inhumane...but this is Islam!"	1
282	WAS MOHD ALSO A ZIONIST? [If saying Isralites have right to their own land makes you a ZIONIST, then Mohd and allah were zoinist too.] And since the promise of everlasting life hasn't come yet, isn't the Isralites still entitled to the gift of land allah supposedly gave them? Why are Muslims hating on Muhammad and allah?	1

285	First, jihad  term is used in the context of prayers, doing righteous deeds, and self-purification; inward jihad or struggle against evil inclinations within oneself (Al-Hajj 22:77-78; and Al-`Ankabut 29:4-7). Second, it is used in the context of social jihad, or striving for truth, justice, and goodness in oneÂs relationship with other humans. Examples of this usage include the payment of charity to the needy (Al-Hujurat 49:15) and striving to persuade those who reject GodÂs message by referring to the arguments presented in the QurÂan (Al-Furqan 25:52). Third, it is used in the context of the battlefield, which is often called, more specifically, qital, which means Âfighting.Â That later form, the combative jihad, is allowed in the QurÂan for legitimate self-defense in the face of unprovoked aggression or in resisting severe oppression on religious or other grounds. In fact, the first verses in the QurÂan that allowed self-defense were not revealed until the early Muslim community had endured more than 13 years of suffering and aggression at the hands of the idolatrous Arabs. The wording of these verses is revealing: [Permission (to fight) is given to those against whom war is being wrongfully waged, and verily, God has indeed the power to aid them. Those who have been driven from their homelands in defiance of right for no other reason than their saying, ÂOur Lord is Allah.Â] (Al-Hajj 22:39-40)	0
286	"Muhammad went into a cave. He was in a cave by himself praying to his pagan rock idols and then an ""angel"" came in and attacked him, and then told him to recite the Qur'an. Mo was also mentally ill, aka bewitched his whole life. And this kept happening, but Muhammad didn't think to ask some friends to come with him for protection? He was suicidally afraid of this angel, but didn't want anyone with him when he received these revelations?  And then, he eventually just started getting ""revelations"" without being beaten up, or even seeing an angel. I'm not surprised. (via Philawallafox) While Christ confirmed his resurrection to many living witnesses, & also proved it through continuous miracles through his name, which we can experience even today in our lives or other's. All this independent proofs combined with the continuity & consistency of the prophets, prophecies & theology. Muhammad had no witness, evidence, testimony & consistency. He contradicts with the Bible & commands to hate & kill their followers."	1
287	"(O you who believe! You are not permitted to inherit women against their will,) ""Before, the practice was that when a man dies, his male relatives used to have the right to do whatever they wanted with his wife. If one of them wants, he would marry her, give her in marriage, or prevent her from marriage, for they had more right to her than her own family. Thereafter, this Ayah was revealed about this practice, (nor to prevent them from marriage, in order to take part of what you have given them,) Allah commands: Do not treat the woman harshly so that she gives back all or part of the dowry that she was given, or forfeits one of her rights by means of coercion and oppression. Allah's statement, (unless they commit open Fahishah.) Ibn Mas`ud said that this refers to illicit sex. Meaning that if the wife commits adultery, you are allowed to take back the dowry you gave her. You are also allowed to annoy her, until she gives back the dowry in return for a Khula`. (And live with them honorably), by saying kind words to them, treating them kindly and making your appearance appealing for them, as much as you can, just as you like the same from them. (If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allah brings through it a great deal of good.) Allah says that your patience, which is demonstrated by keeping wives whom you dislike, carries good rewards for you in this life and the Hereafter. Ibn `Abbas commented on this Ayah, ""That the husband may feel compassion towards his wife and Allah gives him a child with her, and this child carries tremendous goodness.''"	0
288	"The question that always puzzled me is this suggestion : Islam is a religion of peace. Which peace? Where do we see any evidence of that? If someone said: ""Our peace... When the whole world converts to Islam."" I would say Bullshit!! There was never peace in Islam. The last 12 years of Muhammad were full of wars and killing. No sooner Muhammad died from the poison, there were large groups who left Islam. Omar declared war on them and killed a large group of them - officially making it a capital punishment to leave Islam. And the fighting on who should lead the Umma started. Here is fun competition that demonstrate the peaceful nature of Islam. Now let us forget all this. Instead blame the CIA, western intelligence, and zionist for terrorism, fundamentalism, and all the violence in Islam. Repeat after me ""Islam is a religion of peace"". Hurraaayy, not our problem anymore."	1

290	The `Iddah (Waiting Period) of the Divorced Woman. This Ayah contains a command from Allah that the divorced woman, whose marriage was consummated and who still has menstruation periods, should wait for three (menstrual) periods (Quru') after the divorce and then remarry if she wishes.	0
291	"(O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar divorced his wife, during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger , while she was menstruating. `Umar bin Al-Khattab mentioned that to Allah's Messenger . Allah's Messenger became angry and said (Order him to take her back and keep her until she is clean from her menses, and then to wait until she gets her next period and becomes clean again. Then, if he wishes to divorce her, he can divorce her when she is clean from her menses, before he has sexual intercourse with her. This is the `Iddah which Allah the Exalted and Most Honored has fixed.) (divorce them at their `Iddah) He said, ""Purity without intercourse.'' (and count their `Iddah.) meaning, count for it and know its beginning and end, so that the `Iddah does not become prolonged for the woman and she cannot get married again, (And have Taqwa of Allah, your Lord.) in this matter. (And turn them not out of their homes nor shall they leave,) meaning, during the duration of the `Iddah, she has the right to housing from her husband, as long as the `Iddah period continues. Therefore, the husband does not have the right to force her out of her house, nor is she allowed to leave his house, because she is still tied to the marriage contract. Allah said, (except in case they are guilty of Fahishah Mubayyinah.) meaning that the divorced wife is not to abandon her husband's house unless she commits Fahishah Mubayyinah, in which case, she vacates her husband's house. For example, Fahishah Mubayyinah implies adultery, according to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Qilabah, Abu Salih, Ad-Dahhak, Zayd bin Aslam, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi, Sa`id bin Hilal and others. Fahishah Mubayyinah implies disobeying her husband openly or when she abuses her husband's family in words and actions, according to Ubay bin Ka`b, Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah and others. Allah's statement, (And those are the set limits of Allah.) means, these are from His legislation and prohibitions, (And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah,) meaning, whoever violates these limits, transgresses them and implements anything else besides them, (then indeed he has wronged himself.) by doing so. (You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.) meaning, `We commanded that the divorced wife remains in her husband's house during the `Iddah period, so that the husband might regret his action and Allah decides that the husband feels in his heart for the marriage to continue.' This way, returning to his wife will be easier for him."	0

294	The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, Four things are part of happiness: a righteous spouse, a spacious dwelling, a righteous neighbor, and a comfortable mount. Four things are part of misery: a bad neighbor, a bad spouse, a restrictive dwelling, and a bad mount.	0
295	Muslims are required to believe in all the Books revealed by Allah and in all the Prophets sent by Him, otherwise they are not considered true believers. Allah says in the QurÂan as follows: ÂSay: We (Muslims) believe in Allah and in what He has revealed to us, and in what He revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes (of Israel), and in what was given to Moses and Jesus, and in what was given to (all) the prophets by their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him do we submit.Â (Al-Baqarah 2:136). Consequently, if the People of the Book read the QurÂan, they will find in it praise for their Books, Messengers, and Prophets.	0

299	The shocking truth most Muslims don't know! THE QURÂAN AND HADITH CONFIRM MUHAMMAD IS IN HELL & ALL MUSLIMS ARE GOING TO HELL. Islam stands and falls on the person of Muhammad. The entire structure of Islam is built upon the belief that Muhammad was GodÂs greatest prophet. As such, Muslims will naturally expect Allah to resurrect him to a heavenly Paradise immediately upon his death. However, it may come as a shock for them to learn that according to the most authentic Hadith in the Muslim world and substantiated by a verse in the QurÂan, their beloved Prophet is in Hell. Yes! AllahÂs perfect QurÂan clearly states that Muhammad is in Hell along with his pious followers who have passed away in death. Even more troubling for Muslims today is the fact that the very same destiny awaits them. Unbelievable? We will now consider the evidences from both the QurÂan and from authentic Islamic sources to substantiate our case.	1
300	(listen much and eagerly to lies...) and they accept and react to it positively, (And if you judge, judge with justice between them.) and with fairness, even if the Jews were unjust and outcasts from the path of fairness, (Verily, Allah loves those who act justly.)	0
301	When we have a group of gullible people who will believe any old bullshit, why not use your imagination to invent any stories you like. No one will question you or your evidence. But if you are a person who is ready to switch your mind on, you will not stop from finding lots ridiculous claims in the Quran and Hadith. Take this verse. So, if we are the believe that the language of Allah is Arabic and Allah taught Adam all the names and words...how come Arabic as a language cannot be traced anywhere before 1500 BC. Where was this language for 195,000 years in human evolution history? How come we cannot find traces of it in other cultures? Every word traced to Arabic in other languages came after Islam expanded due to trade. When examining ancient Egyptian, Greek, Bronze age, and even stone age written evidence...there is absolutely nothing! Archaeological evidence from across the globe has turned out absolutely nothing!!! 	1

307	"(Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses. And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded a simpler narration than this one from Ubay bin Ka`b who said, ""O Allah's Messenger! When the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed prescribing the `Iddah of divorce, some people in Al-Madinah said, `There are still some women whose `Iddah has not been mentioned in the Qur'an. There are the young, the old whose menstruation is discontinued, and the pregnant.' (and for those who have no courses. (and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make his matter easy for him.) means, Allah will make his matters lenient for him and will soon bring forth relief and a quick way out."	0

(. ..therefore, keep away from women during menses.) meaning, avoid the sexual organ, (...and go not in unto them till they are purified.). (And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you.) indicates that men should have sexual intercourse with their wives after they take a bath. The scholars agree that the woman is obliged to take a bath, or to perform Tayammum with sand, if she is unable to use water, before she is allowed to have sexual intercourse with her husband, after the monthly period ends.(Truly, Allah loves those who turn unto Him in repentance) from the sin even if it was repeated, (and loves those who purify themselves.) meaning, those who purify themselves from the impurity and the filth that include having sexual intercourse with the wife during the menses and anal sex."	0
310	Why does the QurÂan speak approvingly of the persecution of Jews in Madinah? DoesnÂt that betray an element of anti-Semitism or anti-Jewishness, and why does the QurÂan describe Jews and idolatrous people as the most inimical to the believers (Al-MaÂidah 5:85)? IsnÂt that confirmed by the ProphetÂs Âmassacre and persecutionÂ of the Jews of Madinah? Answer: It is incorrect to say that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) was anti-Semitic because he was actually of Semitic heritage himself, as a descendant of Prophet Abraham through his first son Prophet Ishmael. The Western public is accustomed to understanding Âanti-SemitismÂ as referring only to the Jewish people. Many Arabs, including Palestinians, are Semitic people, yet no one speaks about Âanti-SemitismÂ against them in the brutal and nearly genocidal ways in which they are treated by the Israeli government and military, a matter which is objected to by many decent humans, including many Jews. How could the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) be anti-Jewish when the QurÂan mentions the name of Moses (peace and blessings be upon him) and other Israelite prophets in terms of great praise? The QurÂan describes the original Torah that was revealed to Moses (peace and blessings be upon him) as giving light and guidance, and the QurÂan demands respect for the rights of all peacefully coexisting people, including Jews. Criticism in the QurÂan is not about Judaism or Christianity. The criticism in the QurÂan is aimed at distortion and wrong actions committed by Christians, Jews, as well as some Muslims; it does not criticize the pristine message revealed by Allah to Moses (peace and blessings be upon him) and Jesus (peace and blessings be upon him). Just as the Biblical text includes criticism of believers, whether followers of Moses (peace and blessings be upon him) or Jesus (peace and blessings be upon him), the QurÂan also cites wrong actions of Muslims and other groups. Furthermore, criticism is not meant for the sake of criticism, but rather to warn Muslims in particular against repeating the same mistakes in the future.	0
311	"Narrated `Abdullah: I said 'O Allah's Messenger (PBUH)! Which sin is the greatest?"" He said, ""To set up a rival unto Allah, though He Alone created you."" I said, ""What next?""

312	"When Muhammad migrated to Madina, failed to convert the big Jewish tribes - despite his best efforts. But he has built up an extensive army. In that time, the Quran tune changed completely to "" Muslims have to do this and that, don't drink, do not mix with none believers... AND you kuffar are all bastards, either you convert or I will kill you and Allah will stick you like a kabab and fry you... etc"". These became known as Meccian verses and Madina verses. We have our own theory here. Muhammad in Mecca was relying on what he learned from his maternal uncle Waraqah Ibn Nawfal, a priest in Christianity and Judaism, to invent verses in the Quran. But in Madina Muhammad was on his own and making up his own material. What changed between Mecca and Medina that Allah's *language and style* of writing would change!!! "	1
313	"The Qur'anic provision that Muhammad could enjoy any Muslim woman who offered herself to Muhammad appears to have been broad enough to include even maternal aunts, given the ahadith that relate to a certain Khaula bint Hakim. Khaula bint Hakim was Muhammad's maternal aunt, his mother's sister. This we learn from the book of ahadith Musnad Ahmad 26768. What is striking is that this Khaula bint Hakin, ""one of the aunts of the prophet,"" as we learn from Musnad Ahmad, was also one of the women who presented themselves to Muhammad, presumably as a sex offerring. We learn this from another hadith, this one found in Sahih Bukhari 7.62.48. It is clear, they didn't believe him to be a mere prophet but they worshipped him as god, which is evident from the facts that he gave his urine for drinking saying it will save them from hell. He sucked people's tongues and penises saying the same and even offered sex presumably with same promises that pagan gods make even today. Musnad Imam Ahmad.

314	The shariÂa (Islamic Law) regards women as the spiritual and intellectual equals of men. The main distinction it makes between them is in the physical realm based on the equitable principle of fair division of labor. It allots the more strenuous work to man and makes him responsible for the maintenance of the family. It allots the work of managing the home and the upbringing and training of children to woman Â a mission, which has the greatest importance in the task of building a healthy and prosperous society. It is a fact, however, that sound administration within the domestic field is impossible without a unified policy. For this reason shariÂa requires man, as head of the family, to consult with his family and then to have the final say in decisions concerning it. In doing so, he must not abuse his prerogative to cause any injury to his wife. Any transgression of this principle involves for him the risk of losing the favor of God. That is because his wife is not his subordinate but she is, the queen of her house, and this is the position a true believer is expected to give his wife. In contrast to these enlightened teachings of Islam in respect of women, the Western talk of womenÂs liberation or emancipation, is actually a disguised form of exploitation of her body, deprivation of her honor, and degradation of her soul!	0
315	Those non-Muslims permitted to live under the Islamic regime (namely, Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians; i.e. 'Dhimmis') are subjected to unique disadvantages in matters of sexual, domestic, legal, financial, sartorial, physical, communal, and religious autonomy. While this subjugation is comparable - albeit in each specific account different - from the legal disadvantages imposed upon women under Islamic law, the rationale is fundamentally different. The reason for the the subjugation of non-Muslims living in the Islamic state is because the have the potential to convert to Islam - As the Quran states, this subjugation is simply intended as measure which, through bringing about their humiliation, will incentivize their conversion.	1
316	The Prophet Muhammed said: Whoever has two wives and is inclined to favor one of them over the other, he will come on the Day of Resurrection with half of his body leaning.	0
317	It must be made very, very clear that Allah is principally responsible for this gross injustice to a Muslim wife. In Islam all that is required for a husband to divorce his wife is to orally utter ÂtalaqÂ three times and that is it. If it is not for AllahÂs easy divorce laws, a Muslim man will never be able to divorce his wife irrevocably in a heated moment of anger. Who then do you think is to be blamed for this tragedy? Because of AllahÂs easy divorce laws, a Muslim man may divorce his wife irrevocably in a moment of anger. He may not have actually meant it in his heart. He later regrets his action and wants to restore her for himself. Of course, she too would like to go back to her husband and her children who may be still very young. Is it reasonable, according to basic human values of chastity and dignity, for Allah to state that it is not permissible for the woman to return to her husband and children unless she has sexual intercourse Â at least once Â with a total stranger before she is restored to her husband and children again? We need to ask, ÂWhy is Allah punishing the wife in this extremely humiliating way, for the hasty utterance of the easy Islamic divorce formula said in a moment of anger by the foolish husband?Â Is this not discrimination against an innocent wife?	1

The reason for the call to Mubahalah and the revelation of the Ayat from the beginning of this Surah until here, is that a delegation from the Christians of Najran (in Yemen) came to Al-Madinah to argue about `Isa, claiming that he was divine and the son of Allah. Allah sent down the beginning of this Surah until here, to refute their claims."	0

322	What are women rights in Islam? Islamic sources have tired to make up that women had terrible time before Islam. For history is written by the winners. Examine our history, and you will find it is all a lie For we do know something about women's rights BEFORE ISLAM from the story of Khadijah, Muhammad's first wife. Khadijah was an independent business woman, she was the richest of Quraishi tribes, she had the largest convoy of camel who traded with Palestine and Syria, had married two men before Muhammad, she choose her own husbands, in fact she choose Muhammad who was HER OWN EMPLOYEE! She did not need a guardian, no. But Muhammad did require a guardian for himself to marry her!!! Muhammad never dared to marry on her while she was alive. What Muhammad did after he took control? Women to stay at home, cover from head to toe, not allowed to engage in business on their own, have to ask male guardian to get married... Demolition of Women's rights. But we need to buy the story that the pagans of Arabia buried baby girls alive... We, in Islam, bury them for life....Hamdullah.	1
323	Abu Bakr, who was the first caliph in Islam immediately after the ProphetÃ¯?Â½s death, gave the following instructions to his commander who went on a campaign to Syria: ÂDo not betray or be treacherous or vindictive. Do not mutilate. Do not kill the children, the aged or the women. Do not cut or burn palm trees or fruitful trees. DonÃ¯?Â½t slay a sheep, a cow or camel except for your food. And you will come across people who confined themselves to worship in hermitages, leave them alone to what they devoted themselves for.Â And the guiding principle of such noble behavior on the part of Muslim soldiers and commanders is the QurÂanÃ¯?Â½s insistence on justice. The Muslims are commanded to stand out firmly for justice, even opposing their own parents or others intimate to them, if need be. The QurÂan says what means: *{O you who believe! stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to God, even as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be [against] rich or poor: for God can best protect both. Follow not the lusts [of your hearts], lest you swerve, and if you distort [justice] or decline to do justice, verily God is well acquainted with all that you do.}* (An-NisaaÂ 4:135) And again: *{O you who believe! stand out firmly for God, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: that is next to piety: and fear God. For God is well-acquainted with all that you do.}* (Al-MaÂidah 5:8) During the Crusades, the Muslim commander, Salah Ad-din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (Saladin; 1137Ã¯?Â½1193), while engaged in battle with Richard the Lion Heart of England, sent his own personal physician to treat him when he was seriously ill. In fact, he personally supervised RichardÃ¯?Â½s treatment until he became well.	0
324	"Initially, Muhammad insisted he is nothing but a very ordinary person with a message. Thus, he was called ""the humble messenger of Allah"" . As such, he cast himself as nothing special and most definitely not in the same class or level as past prophets. This is significant for to claim to be a prophet, you would be talking directly to Allah - as we see in the stories of Musa (Moses), Essa (Jesus) and Noah. In addition, Muhammad would need a miracle that is compelling to his followers. Instead Muhammad insisted he is not in that category and just a messenger. The heavenly books suggested again that God had send hundreds if not thousands of messengers over time. Over time, however, Muhammad slowly inched himself to the status of Prophet. And why not, this has to embark on setting a completely different branch of the Abraham's. Faith. So surely he needs to up his status. The problem is having a ""miracle"" that he can show the people. Did Muhammad raise the dead, no....did he cure the ill, quiet the opposite as the story of the camel urine mixed with milk shows the people ran away...All Muhammad's claims are conspicuous and no one...I mean NO ONE was there to see it. No names, no eye witnesses, and in essence, if someone made this claim today, as would throw them in the garbage! They ads nothing but claims...but as everything else on the Quran or Hadith about earth creation, human creation, animal creation, start of the universe, astronomy.... you need to be a sponge to accept it. Take a moment to.examine the fact and you will realise it is all Bullshit!"	1
325	And in order to establish the relationship between Muslims and the People of the Book, God has legislated Islam with rulings that bring the relationship closer between it and them, so it is permissible to eat their food and marry them, and this is an invitation to strengthen ties and strengthen the bonds of affection that ensures its continuity and survival.	0

327	One of the features of corrections found in early Quranic manuscripts is the erasing of certain words or phrasesÂ In these images below we can see an eraser that was done to some these manuscripts to remove the Basmala formula which is read at the beginning of each chapter in the Quran, except at the beginning of Chapter 9! at least, in our modern 1924 edition of the Quran. There are various explanations given as to why this Basmala was removedÂ Regardless of such reasons, one can clearly see in the images below that the Basmala used to be written then was erased later to align with the current edition. The logical conclusions rom such action is that the Quran was transmitted and edited based on man-made decisions and often times those edits were done at a later timeÂ The fundamental question is: Who is the real author of this man-made book? And who is in charge or preserving it?!	1
328	"Ibn Abbas mentioned the words of the Almighty, When one or both of them reach old age with you, do not say 'Ugh!' to them out of irritation and do not be harsh with them but speak to them with gentleness and generosity. Take them under your wing, out of mercy, with due humility and say: Lord, show mercy to them as they did in looking after me when I was small. He said, ""This was abrogated in Surat at-Tawba: 'It is not right for the Prophet and those who have iman to ask forgiveness for the mushrikun even if they are close relatives after it has become clear to them that they are the Companions of the Blazing Fire.'

330	Establish the fact that we are not in opposition with the belief in God, but rather we are only bringing about a clarification and return to the more original concepts with Islam. You might even let them know that we are all brothers in humanity as well as acknowledging that we come from Adam. The idea of being a Muslim brother or sister is that we are Âbrothers in faith.Â So make them feel comfortable that we are not trying to deny God, His Books, His Angels and His Messengers, not at all. Islam is only making clear what the concept and relationship of Allah is to us.	0
331	After the Islamic army had conquered the Levant, Iraq and Homs, Abu Ubaidah - may God be pleased with him - heard that the Romans were preparing a large army led by Heraclius to fight the Muslims, so he returned the tribute to the people of Homs and Damascus,  and he said to them, ÂWe cannot protect you and defend you, and this is your reward that you paid us in exchange for your protection.Â They replied, ÂBy God, your justice is more beloved to us than the oppression and injustice of the Romans,Â even though they were on the same religion.	0

333	Was the spirit really the angel Gabriel? Had the spirit been Gabriel, he would have reassured Muhammad and calmed his fears. However, the spirit left him in extreme distress. The encounter by Muhammad stands in stark contrast to the gentle nature of angelic encounters in the Bible. The true Gabriel and other angels almost always begin their conversation with the comforting phrase, ÂDo not be fearful.Â This leaves us back to our question: Who did Muhammad meet in the cave?	1
334	Islam is keen to argue with the People of the Book in a way that is best, reminding them of the origin of their belief. And what their prophets and messengers brought, so if a Muslim does not employ himself to argue with them in a way that is better for him to refrain from that, and Islam does not want them except to worship God alone and not associate with Him.	0
335	Peaceful dialogue, especially with the People of the Book: All of the above nine principles apply to all non-Muslims. The QurÂan accords the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) a special position. The very term to designate them distinguishes them from others such as idolatrous Arabs (Al-Bayyinah 98:1). It is a complimentary title as it acknowledges that, like Muslims, their faiths are based on revealed books or scriptures. In its family and dietary laws, the QurÂan gives a special consideration to the People of the Book. For example, a Muslim male may marry a believing Jewish or Christian woman (Al-MaÂidah 5:5). The QurÂan exhorts Muslims to engage in peaceful dialogue with Jews and Christians: [Say (O Muslims), O People of the Book! Come to a common term which we and you hold in common: that we shall worship none but Allah, and that we shall not ascribe divinity to none beside Him, and that we shall not take human beings for our lord beside Allah, and if they turn away, then say: bear witness that we submit ourselves unto Him.] (Aal `Imran 3:64).	0
336	(O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another.) so that they get to know each other by their nation or tribe. (Verily, the most honorable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa.) meaning, `you earn honor with Allah the Exalted on account of Taqwa, not family lineage.' There are many Hadiths from the Prophet that support this meaning. (Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.) means, `He is All-Knowing of you and All-Aware of all of your affairs.' Allah guides whom He wills, misguides whom He wills, grants mercy to whom He wills, tor- ments whom He wills, elevates whom He wills above whom He wills. He is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware in all this. Several scholars relied on this honorable Ayah and the honora- ble Hadiths we menti- oned as evidence that compatibility in marriage is not a condition of marriage contracts. They said that the only condition required in this regard is the adherence to the religion, as in the statement of Allah, the Exalted.	0
337	It took us years of studying Islam to realise it not a religion of peace, not feminist by any stretch of the imagination, and has many scientific and moral issues. And converts go through this cycle too. Some take weeks, months, or years but when they realise they were sold a lie, they leave quietly. No big publicity stunts or PR videos. 	1
338	"This is a command from Allah to the believing women, and jealousy on His part over the wives of His believing servants. It is also to distinguish the believing women from the women of the Jahiliyyah and the deeds of the pagan women. The reason for the revelation of this Ayah was mentioned by Muqatil bin Hayyan, when he said: ""We heard -- and Allah knows best -- that Jabir bin `Abdullah Al-Ansari narrated that Asma' bint Murshidah was in a house of hers in Bani Harithah, and the women started coming in to her without lower garments so that the anklets on their feet could be seen, along with their chests and forelocks. Asma' said: `How ugly this is! (O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks all over their bodies. That will be better, that they should be known, so as not to be annoyed)"	0
339	5 times prayers a thorn in the flesh of all Muslims! Muslims can't rely on Qur'an alone because it's not complete and some are rejecting Hadith! 5 or 3 times prayers: which one? If you said Qur'an, then why are you having 5 times prayers? And if you said 5 times, this man in video said Muhammad knew nothing about the Hadith saying 5 times prayers! If you allowed your brain to work, like this Muslim guy in the video, you will see many more errors. 	1
340	Muhammed is the first persecutor of women, Mohammed is the First Feminist	1
341	Tragically, Islam discourages the asking of questions. Allah and Muhammad discourage Muslims from asking questions. From infancy Muslims are groomed to abstain from questioning the tenents of Islam. Thus, Muslims grow up learning not to question their religion. Questioning Islam is viewed the same as the sin of apostasy. To prevent someone from asking questions is to take away the basic rights of that individual. Asking questions is an inherent part of human nature. By quelling questions, Islam is destroying the reasoning power of humans.	1

Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife [Hawwa (Eve)], and from them both He created many men and women and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship) .

344	The fact that only Muhammad is accused of polygamy is rather surprising, since this is a privilege enjoyed by prophets before him. Their wives and concubines came in great numbers, too! The Torah, the Bible, and the QurÂan tell of some of them; the rest are not mentioned so we donÂt know, but among the ones who were polygamous we can count Prophets Ibrahim (Abraham), Ya`qub (Jacob), Dawud (David), and Sulayman (Solomon). The Scriptures talk of polygamy as a ÂfavorÂ bestowed upon them from the Lord. First Kings 11:1-3 indicates that King Solomon had 700 hundred wives and 300 hundred concubines! In sealing treaties in ancient days, it was customary for a lesser king to give his daughter in marriage to the greater king. Every time a new treaty was sealed, Solomon ended up with yet another wife. These wives were considered Âtokens of friendshipÂ and ÂsealedÂ the relationship between the two kings. (Reasoning from the Scriptures on 1 Kings) Scripture indicates that David also acquired wives and concubines, DavidÂs blessings, including his wives, were given to him as a result of GodÂs favor (2 Sam. 5:12-13; 12:8; D & C 132:39). Scriptural records say that the Lord did command some of his ancient saints to practice plural marriage. Abraham, Isaac, and JacobÂamong others (D & C 132)Âconformed to this ennobling and exalting principle; the whole history of ancient Israel was one in which plurality of wives was a divinely accepted and approved order of matrimony. Those who entered this order at the LordÂs command, and who kept the laws and conditions appertaining to it, have gained for themselves eternal exaltation in the highest heaven of the celestial world. (Mormon Doctrine of Plural Marriage p. 578).	0
345	The Great Wisdom in Selecting `AÂishah in Particular as a Young Wife `AÂishah (may Allah be pleased with her) came from a house famous for learning and memorizing great quantities of knowledge; her father was a live encyclopedia of Arab tribal pedigrees and poetry. She inherited his ability, and in her young, intelligent, receptive mind, she preserved a precious portion of Islam she learned during seven years of marriage, for 47 years after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and she taught thousands of men worldwide their religion as she had learned it firsthand from the Prophet. To our present day, she is considered among the most prominent Islamic scholars, and she holds extremely high esteem in the hearts of all Muslims as such and as Âthe beloved of the Prophet,Â who often mentioned her as the human he loved the most on the face of this earth. With her, he built a model Muslim home for Muslims to strive to imitate forever.	0
346	Ibn Abbas reported the Prophet as saying, A woman without a husband has more right to her person than her guardian, and a virginÂs permission must be asked about herself, her permission being her silence. In a version he said, A woman who has been previously married* has more right to her person than her guardian, and a virgin must be consulted, her permission consisting in her saying nothing. In another version he said, A woman who has been previously married has more right to her person than her guardian and a virginÂs father must ask her permission about herself, her permission being her silence.  Thayyib. This means a woman previously married who has no husband. In view of the context it is argued that ayyim is used above in this sense.	0
347	"WHO DECIDES WHICH QURAN VERSE IS ABROGATED? Allah claims in the Quran that it is a clear book. In reality, the Quran is a book of confusion. Since the time Muhammad invited the theory of Abrogation to nullify the contradiction controversy of the Qur'an, it  has been nothing but a book in crisis when it comes to its interpretation. He failed to point out which specific verse of the Qur'an abrogates which verse. This is now open to interpretation by any Muslim.  ""Islamic revelations do not state which Quranic verses or hadith have been abrogated, and Muslim exegetes and jurists have disagreed over which and how many hadith and verses of the Quran are recognized as abrogated, with estimates varying from less than ten to over 500.'' So much for a clear book! Muslims have to further invent theories to get out of this mess. Theories Muhammad never heard or approved of. Phrases like, ""abrogated in recitation but not in ruling,"" and ""abrogated in ruling but not in recitation"" were all invented by Muslims to deal with the drama of Abrogation."	1
348	Islam singled out women with preservation and honor, and surrounded them with a fence of care and attention, and commanded men to treat them well, whether they were a mother, sister, daughter, or wife, and emphasized that men and women are equal in humanity, as God Almighty indicated in the Holy QurÂan that men and women are created From one origin, and when the Messenger of God - may GodÂs prayers and peace be upon him - was sent, he denied the pre-Islamic customs that oppressed and oppressed women, and placed her in a high position worthy of her as a mother, sister, daughter and wife, and enacted rights for women that guarantee them a decent life, respect and appreciation. The Arabs used to play with girls, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade this heinous act, and made it one of the greatest sins. During the article, verses about womenÂs rights will be mentioned.	0

(Nor defame yourselves,) forbids defaming each other. He among men who is a slanderer, and a backbiter, is cursed and condemned. (nor insult one another by nicknames.) When the Messenger of Allah migrated to Al-Madinah, every man among us had two or three nicknames. When the Prophet called a man by one of these nicknames, people would say, `O Allah's Messenger! He hates that nickname. (Evil is the name of wickedness after faith), means, the names and descriptions of wickedness are evil; meaning, `to use the nicknames that were used by the people of Jahiliyyah, after you embraced Islam and understood it,' (And whosoever does not repent,) means, from this sin, (then such are indeed wrongdoers.)	0
350	Messenger of Allah(peace be upon him) said: Take my advice with regard to women: Act kindly towards women, for they were created from a rib, and the most crooked part of a rib is its uppermost.

352	"After Allah mentioned the filthy things that He prohibited for His believing servants and the good things that He allowed for them, He said next, (Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibat.) Allah then mentioned the ruling concerning the slaughtered animals of the People of the Book, the Jews and Christians (The food of the People of the Scripture is lawful to you..) meaning, their slaughtered animals, as Ibn `Abbas, Abu Umamah, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, `Ata', Al-Hasan, Makhul, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, As-Suddi and Muqatil bin Hayyan stated. This ruling, that the slaughtered animals of the People of the Book are permissible for Muslims, is agreed on by the scholars, because the People of the Book believe that slaughtering for other than Allah is prohibited. They mention Allah's Name upon slaughtering their animals, even though they have deviant beliefs about Allah that do not befit His majesty. It is recorded in the Sahih that `Abdullah bin Mughaffal said, ""While we were attacking the fort of Khaybar, a person threw a leather bag containing fat, and I ran to take it and said, `I will not give anyone anything from this container today.' But when I turned I saw the Prophet (standing behind) while smiling.'' The scholars rely on this Hadith as evidence that we are allowed to eat what we need of foods from the booty before it is divided. "	0

355	"You can read this and many more on-demand verses that Muhammad invented on the go (if you dare) from here: Allah said a maximum of four wives,  like a corrupted politician, Muhammad set the rules that he was supposed to obey but broke them. Thus he had to invent new verses to justify the actions. Muhammad had at the time of this story had already married 11 wives, many concubines, and still to Aisha's shock, Muhammad was sleeping with any Muslim women who came along, even without the approval of a male guardian. So she kicks up a fuss with Muhammad, like what the hell!! But the next day ""Allah"" responded with an out-of-jail card... Subhan Allah. You can read this and many more on demand verses that Muhammad invented on the go."	1
356	It may be noted that Âturning awayÂ from this invitation is not presented as a punishable offense in this life, and that the consequence of rejection is to simply testify MuslimsÂ submission to Allah. Another verse in the QurÂan encourages peaceful dialogue and invites all to build upon the common ground between Muslims and the People of the Book. The QurÂan instructs Muslims: [And do not argue with the People of Book except in a most kindly manner, except for those of them who are bent on evildoing, and say: ÂWe believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which has come down to you; our Lord and yours is One and it is to Him that we (all) submit ourselves.Â] (Al-`Ankabut 29:46) Not only do Muslims, Christians, and Jews share belief in the One God and divine revelation, they also share belief in human responsibility, consequences of good and evil deeds, moral teachings, and other values such as love, peace, and justice. It may be concluded that the ten values and principles above represent a solid foundation for a peaceful relationship and coexistence with all, irrespective of their religious choices. 	0
357	Warning: we apologize for the words used in this post. Introduction to anal jihad. 1 - get screwed many times to widen your ass. 2 - insert high explosives in your ass. 3 - find a crowd you hate and explode your ass. 4 - Allah will reward you with 72 virgins. Let's get this straight. Homosexuality is forbidden in Islam, but Allah is okay with it if you do it for the sake of killing people.	1
358	"Allah states that He has created all mankind from Adam, peace be upon him, and from Adam, He created his wife, Hawwa' and from them, people started to spread. (And (then) He has created from him his wife, in order that he might enjoy the pleasure of living with her.) so that he is intimate and compassionate with her. Allah said in another Ayah, (And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives (spouses) from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy.) Indeed, there is no intimacy between two souls like that between the spouses. This is why Allah mentioned that the sorcerer might be able with his trick to separate between a man and his wife, thus indicating the difficulty of separating them in normal circumstances. (When he covered her) meaning had sexual intercourses with her. (she became pregnant and she carried it about lightly) in reference to the first stage of pregnancy when the woman does not feel pain, for at that time, the fetus will be just a Nutfah (the mixture of the male and female discharge), then becomes an `Alaqah (a piece of thick coagulated blood) and then a Mudghah (a small lump of flesh), (and she carried it about (lightly).), means, it became clear that she was pregnant. Ibn Jarir commented, ""This Ayah means that the liquid remained, whether she stood up or sat down.'' Al-`Awfi recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, ""The semen remained in, but she was unsure if she became pregnant or not, (Then when it became heavy), she became heavier with the fetus'', As-Suddi said, ""The fetus grew in her womb.''"	0
359	These Ayat contain a relief from Allah for the Muslims by ending the practice that was observed in the early years of Islam. At that time, Muslims were allowed to eat, drink and have sexual intercourse only until the `Isha' (Night) prayer, unless one sleeps before the `Isha' prayer. Those who slept before `Isha' or offered the `Isha' prayer, were not allowed to drink, eat or sexual intervourse sex until the next night. The Muslims found that to be difficult for them. 	0
360	All these doctrines paved the path for her competency. A woman is to independently lead her life and deal with its conditions; trade, expenditure, proxy, association, etcetera. All that was reflected upon three main dimensions in her life; the human, social and legal; she became a full and independent ÂhumanÂ and a partner in human development; while it was not the case at all before Islam. Also her social role was acknowledged, all as a mother, wife, daughter, and partner in work and home; and, finally, her financial independence was bestowed upon maturity.	0
361	Abu Musa al-AshÂari reported GodÂs messenger as saying, Three types will have a double reward: one of the people of the Book who believes in his prophet and believes in Muhammad; a slave when he fulfils what is due to God and what is due to his patrons; and a man who has a slavegirl with whom he has intercourse, who gives her a good training in manners and a good education, then sets her free and marries herÂhe will have a double reward.	0
362	Islam does not prohibit Muslims from being kind and generous to people of other religions, even if they are idolaters and polytheists. However, Islam looks upon the People of the Book, that is, Jews and Christians, with special regard, whether they reside in a Muslim society or outside it	0
363	This obsession with five times a day prayer, mentioning Allah with every step, every action, and having specific words to say when you do sometime bad, like fart!! Means we are consumed by the faith in everything we do, including when we have sex. It may seem harmless but it is not harmless. It is intended to make a believer think that a god, all-mighty, who created this vast universe from nothing, is too busy checking if you think of him every second of the day. Does that make sense? No. Now imagine for a moment, humour me if you care, and consider if Muhammad had invented Islam. To make sure people never questioned him and part of is abracadabra act, would attribute everything be does to Allah. Even sleeping with women...he went as far as turning parts of the Quran into a book about his sex life, please read chapter 33. And people simply copied him...but not only copied him, he encouraged them to keep it up...so much so, it became an obsession. Brother and sister, next time you say Bismillah, ask yourself...is this really want a god all-mighty should be concerned about, or should He be more concerned about people dying, people sick, people who are hungry...not hoping your sex pill will last longer!!	1
364	"(Do not believe the People of the Book and do not deny them. Say: ""We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to you. Our God and your God is One, and to Him we have submitted.'')'' This Hadith was narrated only by Al-Bukhari. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said: ""How can you ask the People of the Book about anything, when your Book that was revealed to the Messenger of Allah is more recent, you read it pure and uncontaminated, it tells you that the People of the Book altered and changed the Book, that they write the Book with their own hands and then say, `This is from Allah,' to purchace with it a small price Should not the knowledge that you have, prevent you from asking them No, by Allah, we have never seen any of them asking you about what was sent down to you.'' Al-Bukhari recorded that Humayd bin `Abdur-Rahman heard Mu`awiyah talking to a group of Quraysh in Al-Madinah. He mentioned Ka`b Al-Ahbar, and said: ""He was one of the most truthful of those who narrated from the People of the Book, even though we found that some of what he said might be lies.'' I say, this means that some of what he said could be classified linguistically as lies, but he did not intend to lie, because he was narrating from manuscripts which he thought were good, but they contained fabricated material, because they did not have people who were so conscientious in memorizing the Scriptures by heart as the people of this great Ummah."	0

(20:44) Allah says here: (except with such of them as do wrong;) meaning, those who turn away from the truth, turning a blind eye to clear evidence, being stubborn and arrogant. In this case you should progress from debate to combat, fighting them in such a way as to deter them from committing aggression against you. Allah says: (and say (to them): ""We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you;) means, `if they tell you something which you do not know to be true or false, say to them: We do not hasten to say it is a lie, because it may be true, and we do not hasten to say it is true because it may be false. We believe in it in general, under the condition that it has been revealed and has not been altered or deliberately misinterpreted.'

369	"The story of Dhul-Qarnayn (""The Two-Horned One"", also transliterated as Zul-Qarnain or Zulqarnain) is found in the 18th Surah of the Qur'an, al-Kahf (the Cave). While he is never mentioned explicitly by name, the story is clearly based upon a legendary account of Alexander the Great. For centuries, most Muslim historians and Qur'anic commentators endorsed the identity of Dhul-Qarnayn as Alexander, though some also proposed alternatives. In recent years, this identification of Dhul-Qarnayn has become particularly problematic and controversial for Muslim scholars, as the Qur'an's understanding of Alexander differs remarkably from the image of him in history as a Greek pagan who fashioned himself as a god. This has prompted some apologists to create and advance alternative theories that identify Dhul-Qarnayn as other prominent historical kings, most notably Cyrus the Great. These alternative theories, though, have major deficiencies and fall short of the strong parallels between the Qur'anic story and legends of Alexander that date to the early 7th century. The theory that Dhul-Qarnayn is some other figure such as Cyrus the Great has little evidence in its favor compared to the overwhelming evidence that the story is actually based on a legendary version of Alexander. The story in the Qur'an in fact parallels a medieval Syriac legend of Alexander quote closely; both narratives portray him as a believing king who traveled the world and built a barrier of iron which holds back the tribes of Gog and Magog until Judgement Day. Almost every major element of the Qur'anic story can be found in Christian and Jewish folklore about Alexander which dates back hundreds of years prior to the time of Prophet Muhammad. Most early Muslim commentators and scholars identified Dhul-Qarnayn as Alexander the Great, and some modern ones do too. Historical and Archaeological evidence, though, quite plainly reveal that the real Alexander was a polytheistic pagan who believed he was the literal son of Greek and Egyptian gods. In addition, the story speaks of a giant wall built by Dhul-Qarnayn to hold back the nations of Gog and Magog, yet today, there is no such giant wall of iron and brass between two mountains that is holding back a tribe of people; it likely never existed and was originally a legendary embellishment of the original Alexander legend."	1
370	It should be evident to Muslims that they have to reject & mock the whole scripture or prophets in order to support one false pagan prophet, yet they have to resort to desperate attempts to find support for Muhammad through Bible, be it attempts to turn the Holy Spirit promise into Mo, or turn Valley of Baca (Northern Israel) into Kaba; Allelujah and Elah, Eloi into al-Lah the moon god Ya-SÃ¯n. If you are to submit to the truth and God then stop following the satanic false prophet false Messiah.	1
371	The Messenger of God peace be upon him said: I enjoin good treatment of women, for they are prisoners with you, and you have no right to treat them otherwise, unless they commit clear indecency. If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark. If they obey you, then do not seek means of annoyance against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they are not to allow anyone whom you dislike to tread on your bedding (furniture), nor allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses. And their right over you are that you should treat them kindly with regard to their clothing and food.	0
372	The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) emphasized the duties of Muslims toward dhimmis, threatening anyone who violates them with the wrath and punishment of Allah. The Prophet is reported to have said, He who hurts a dhimmi hurts me, and he who hurts me annoys Allah (At-Tabarani). He also says: ÂWhoever hurts a dhimmi, I am his adversary, and I shall be an adversary to him on the Day of ResurrectionÂ (Al-Khatib). ÂOn the Day of Judgment, I will dispute with anyone who oppresses a person from among the People of the Covenant, or infringes upon his right, or puts a responsibility on him which is beyond his strength, or takes something from him against his willÂ (Abu Dawud). The successors of the Prophet safeguarded these rights and sanctities of non-Muslim citizens, and the jurists of Islam, in spite of the variation of their opinions regarding many other matters, are unanimous in emphasizing these rights and sanctities.	0

376	MUHAMMAD TORTURES FOR MONEY: Mohd, a guy seen in the eyes of Muslims as the best human to walk the surface of the earth. Muslims are ever ready to kill and be killed for him. Ironically, Mohd's entire life was what you would advice your children not to do. Aside from the fact that he assassinated his critics, had sex with a 9 year old child, raped captive women, engaged in slave trading and robbed caravans, HE ALSO TORTURED PEOPLE FOR THEIR HARD EARNED WEALTH.  After Mohd attacked and captured the Jewish town of Khaibar, he had his followers torture a Jewish man named Kinana. Kinana was a very wealthy man and mohd made sure before he killed him, he will get all his wealth. Mohd had Kinana torture so he could reveal where he had hidden his wealth. Ibn Ishaq 515: Kinana b. al-Rabi, who had the custody of the treasures of B. al-Nadir, was brought to the Apostle who asked him about it. He denied that he knew where it was. A Jew came (T. was brought) to the Apostle and said that he had seen Kinana going round certain ruin every morning early. When the Apostle said to Kinana, 'Do you know that if we find you have it I shall kill you?' he said Yes. The Apostle gave orders that the ruin was to be excavated and some of the treasures were found. When he asked him about the rest he refused to produce it, so the Apostle gave orders to al-Zubayr b. al-Awwam, ' Torture him until you extract what he has,' so he kindled a fire with flint and steel on his chest until he was nearly dead. Then the Apostle delivered him to Muhammad b. Maslama and he struck off his head, in revenge for his brother Mahmud. Mohd the torturer and robber, yet seen by Muslims as the best of mankind. NOTE that after mohd killed Kinana, he also forcely married his wife, Safiyya bint Huyai. Welcome to Islam, the religion that adores and honors the wicked.	1

381	"A honest enquiry from a Muslim: Praise be to Allah and peace be upon the one after whom there is no [further] prophet. After the permanent committee for the scientific research and fatwahs (religious decrees) reviewed the question presented to the grand Mufti Abu Abdullah Muhammad Al-Shemary, the question forwarded to the committee by the grand scholar of the committee with reference number 1809 issued on 3/8/1421 (Islamic calendar corresponding to 30/10/2000). The inquirer asked the following: It has become wide spread these days, and especially during weddings, the habit of mufaÂkhathat of the children (mufaÂkhathat literally translated means ""placing between the thighs"" which means placing the male member between the thighs of a child). What is the opinion of scholars knowing full well that the prophet, the peace and prayer of Allah be upon him, also practiced the ""thighing"" of Aisha - the mother of believers - may Allah be please with her. After the committee studied the issue, they gave the following reply: It has not been the practice of the Muslims throughout the centuries to resort to this ""unlawful"" practice that has come to our countries from pornographic movies that the kufar (infidels) and enemies of Islam send. As for the prophet, peace and prayer of Allah be upon him, thighing his fiancÃ©e Aisha. She was six years of age and he could not have intercourse with her due to her small age. That is why [the prophet] peace and prayer of Allah be upon him placed his [male] member between her thighs and massaged it softly, as the apostle of Allah had control of his [male] member not like other believers. Our summary: ""Muhammad placed his penis between the thighs of baby Aisha and he massaged it to orgasm. This continued until Aisha turned 9 and Mohammed eventually raped her (consummated his marriage)"" Our take away: They admit Mohammed thighed Aisha at age 6 They admit Mohammed raped Aisha at age 9 They admit Aisha was a toddler They called Aisha Mohammed's fiancÃ©e They called Mohammed's action unlawful They blamed it on the infidels of today They blamed it on enemies of Islam They claim Mohammed controlled his lust.

After that, Allah prohibited this practice. Allah has also threatened those who indulge in such practices, when He said; ...and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself.) meaning, by defying Allah's commandments.

This is although many other prophets of the Bible fought wars too! They also criticize the fact that Muhammad (pbuh) had nine wives.

How could circumstances change so drastically during the course of the night to justify the abrogation of the Quranic verse the following day? Why did not Allah know that? How could the eternal Book of Allah have such time-bound revelations in it? Why does Allah find it necessary to abrogate his verses so soon after they were revealed? Does not this nullify the claim of divine authorship? Either Allah is an impostor or Muhammad is faking inspiration. Either option disqualifies the Quran as the eternal Word of God.	1
393	Marriage in Islam requires the consent of both parties before the validity of the union is recognized. Marriage is viewed as a partnership in Islam. The QurÂan does not describe marriage as an inevitable evil, but as a blessing that God endows on people: it is a source of tranquility, peace, mutual love, and affection. Marriage in Islam requires the consent of both parties before the validity of the union is recognized. With regard to the treatment of women in general and wives in particular, Prophet Muhammad stressed on the notion of equity toward women. The QurÂan ranks compassion and kindness to parents, especially the mother, next to injunctions to worship Allah alone. Prophet Muhammad said, Â Paradise is at the feet of the motherÂ (An-NasaÂi). God says in the QurÂan what means, [And your Lord has commanded that you shall not serve any but Him, and goodness to your parents. If either or both of them reach old age with you, say not to them (so much as) ÂUghÂ nor chide them, and speak to them a generous word.] (Al-IsraaÂ 17:23) [And We have enjoined on man (to be good) to his parents: in travail upon travail did his mother bear him, and in years twain was his weaning: (hear the command), ÂShow gratitude to Me and to thy parents: to Me is (thy final) Goal.] (Luqman 31:34).	0
394	It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Saum (the fasts). They are Libas [i.e. body cover, or screen, or Sakan, (i.e. you enjoy the pleasure of living with her), for you and you are the same for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allah has ordained for you (offspring), and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Saum (fast) till the nightfall. And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in IÂtikaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by Allah, so approach them not. Thus does Allah make clear His Ayat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, revelations, verses, laws, legal and illegal things, AllahÂs set limits, orders, etc.) to mankind that they may become Al-Muttaqun	0
395	Malik reported Allah's Messenger (PBUH) as saying: He, who brought up two girls properly till they grew up, he and I would come (together) (very closely) on the Day of Resurrection, and he interlaced his fingers (for explaining the point of nearness between him and that person)	0

They forbid Lah to come to earth, otherwise how would they reject the incarnation of God in Jesus? So Lah can't come to earth, yet the black stone represent him as his right hand	1
398	And Allah has set forth an example for those who believe, the wife of FirÂaun (Pharaoh), when she said: ÂMy Lord! Build for me a home with You in Paradise, and save me from FirÂaun (Pharaoh) and his work, and save me from the people who are Zalimun (polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers in Allah).	0
399	Allah admonishes the hypocrites who, unlike the believers, who enjoin righteousness and forbid evil, (they enjoin evil, and forbid the good, and they close their hands), from spending in Allah's cause, (They have forgotten Allah), they have forgotten the remembrance of Allah, (so He has forgotten them.), by treating them as if He has forgotten them. (Verily, the hypocrites are the rebellious) the rebellious from the way of truth who embrace the wicked way.	0

402	The only exception is given to Muslim men who are allowed to marry the chaste girls from among the People of the Book. As for why Islam allows a Muslim man to marry a Christian or Jewish woman, itÂs clear that every Muslim believes in Moses and Jesus (peace be upon them) and he holds all the Prophets of Allah in high esteem. Thus a Muslim finds no harm in his wifeÂs being a Christian or a Jew, for the spirit of tolerance Islam holds for other religions is ingrained in him. First, the man is the head of the household, the one who maintains the family, and he is responsible for his wife. And while Islam guarantees freedom of belief and practice to the Christian or Jewish wife of a Muslim, safeguarding her rights according to her own faith, other religions, such as Judaism and Christianity, do not guarantee the wife of a different faith freedom of belief and practice, nor do they safeguard her rights. 	0
403	It must be noted that this verse does not address Muslims exclusively, but begins with the inclusive address ÂO humankind,Â an address that embraces all. It reminds humanity that they belong to one family with the same set of parents, albeit a diverse family. This is a reminder that diversity in unity and unity within diversity are possible. Humanity is like a bouquet of flowers in which each flower is beautiful in its own right, yet, the combination of all flowers and the rich diversity of their colors is more beautiful. This sweeping statement in the QurÂan about broad human brotherhood is a profound basis for peace for and among all. Acceptance of plurality in human societies: While the notion of plurality may appear to be a relatively new concept, it is not new to those who are familiar with the QurÂan. The QurÂan is quite explicit in reminding all that if God willed, He would have made of all mankind one nation (Al-MaÂidah 5:48; Hud 11:118). Likewise, the QurÂan states that had it been GodÂs will, He would have made all people believers (Yunus 10:99).	0

406	The basis of the tolerance of Islam is its emphasis on the Oneness of God. It means that The Creator and Sustainer of the whole universe is One; that all humans whether white or black, brown or yellow are of equal status before God; that all the so-called monotheistic religions are basically one, since their origin is the guidance sent down by the One and Only God. It may be surprising for many non-Muslims to know that the Muslims honor all the prophets of God, including Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus. Muslims have to respect all these prophets, just as they respect the last prophet, Muhammad (pbuh).	0
407	How do you explain verses in the QurÂan that encourage killing non-Muslims wherever they are found (9:5) and others that allow fighting against Jews, Christians, and other neighboring non-Muslims (9:29, 123)? Answer: To begin with, the verse (9:5) has nothing to do with the People of the Book (Jews and Christians), who are distinguished from other non-Muslims. The QurÂanic text (98:1) makes a clear distinction between the People of the Book or Ahl Al-Kitab and the idolatrous people, al-mushrikeen, the term used in 9:5. Furthermore,all these and similar verses have been sometimes misconstrued and taken out of their textual and historical context. They have been taken out of their textual context by ignoring the verses before and after the quoted ones, as well as ignoring other verses in the QurÂan which relate to the same issues and thus shed light on their true meanings. They have also been taken out of the historical context that could explain why they were revealed and how they should be applied. All of these verses, without exception, if studied carefully, address aggression and oppression committed against Muslims at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), whether by idolatrous Arabs, some of the Jewish tribes in Madinah, or by some Christians. Most, however, apply to the Makkans and other idolatrous Arabs aggressors. Some of the antagonists tortured, and in certain cases killed, Muslims because of their faith, for example the killing of Sumayyah and her husband Yasir. Some killed the memorizers of the QurÂan who were simply on their way to preach its message of AllahÂs Oneness in a peaceful manner. Some of them killed the messengers sent by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), which is equivalent in todayÂs international law to killing the ambassador of another countryÂan act of war. Some of them gathered armies, like the Christians in Tabuk, in order to attack Muslims. Some of them wrote letters to their local governors to go and kill the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) unless he recanted his claim of prophethood, as was the case with the Emperor of Persia. Some betrayed peace treaties and killed unsuspecting peaceful people without provocation, contrary to agreements, such as the breaking of the Treaty of Hudaybiah by the Makkans. The issue here is not religion, but rather injustice, oppression, and aggression. There are many verses in the QurÂan stating that those who coexist peacefully with Muslims are entitled to justice, compassion, and respect, irrespective of their religion (60:8-9) as long as they are peaceful with Muslims. If it were true that the QurÂan instructs that any non-Muslim should be killed because of his or her religion, then what would explain the fact that religious minorities through 1,400 years of Muslim history not only survived, but also thrived and found freedom to practice their faiths under Muslim rule? Clearly, Muslims as a people were not perfect, yet there were times when they had enough power to eliminate almost all non-Muslims under their rule. The historical record shows that they did not abuse this power. The restraint they showed seems to be influenced in the first place by the QurÂanic injunctions against coercion in religion. The QurÂan allows a Muslim man to get married to a Christian or Jewish woman. If it were true that the QurÂan demands killing non-Muslims, how could it permit a Muslim man to marry such women? Marriage is the closest human relationship and is described in the QurÂan as a relationship characterized by peace, love, and compassion (30:21), not murder because of theological differences.	0
408	In Islam, women were created only for sexual pleasure and to satisfy the desires of a Muslim man, and he can imprison a woman to death if she does not obey him.	1
409	"Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah: We went out with the Messenger of Allah and came to a woman of the Ansar in al-Aswaf. The woman brought her two daughters, and said: Messenger of Allah, these are the daughters of Thabit ibn Qays who was killed as a martyr when he was with you at the battle of Uhud, their paternal uncle has taken all their property and inheritance, and he has not left anything for them. What do you think, Messenger of Allah? They cannot be married unless they have some property. The Messenger of Allah said: Allah will decide regarding the matter. Then the verse of Surat an-Nisa was revealed: ""Allah (thus) directs you as regards your children's (inheritance)."" Messenger of Allah said: Call to me the woman and her husband's brother. He then said to their paternal uncle: Give them two-thirds and their mother an eighth, and what remains is yours"	0
410	Allah is effectively permitting Muslim husbands to rape their wives. Marital rape is not a crime in Islam. Even if some do not view marital rape as a crime, the fact that Muslim husbands can demand sex without considering the feelings of their wives shows that Allah has lowered the status of the wives to that of a mere sexual object. Is there no mutual respect for each otherÂs body in the marital relationship between a husband and a wife in Islam?	1
411	Allah sees every thing. Allah sees children's suffering, Allah seeing abuse, killings, rapes, tortures, corruption, crimes, and yet He seems more concerned what one person does privately in their bedroom, who they marry, who they love, how they enter a toilet, what to say after they drink water, if they missed a step while washing before they pray ... And lots of stupidity and ridiculous trivial issues. If Allah was real, I would call Him a freak !! But then, I know Allah is made up ... Like many other religions, once we needed imaginary supernatural sky daddy to make us behave and be afraid. Now we have better understanding of humanity and importance of life. There is 1.2 billion people in the world who are atheist or agnostic. Japan, Denmark, Iceland, France, and many countries have very high percentage of none believers in any faith, yet they have lowest crime rates ... Shows, one does not need religion or an imaginary man in the sky to know right from wrong. And most definitely the idea of sky daddy who watches your every move, answers your call to pass an interview or exam, while leaving many suffer and their pleas for help go unanswered.	1
412	The QurÂan does not prescribe any punishment for rejecting the ÂinvitationÂ to accept Islam. [But if they turn away (from accepting AllahÂs message, then know that) We have not sent you to be their keeper. Your duty is only to convey (the message).] (Ash-Shura 42:48) Universal mercy: The essence of Islam and its ProphetÂs mission is summed up in the following verse: [And (thus, O Muhammad), We have not sent you, but as mercy to all the worlds.] (Al-AnbiyaaÂ 21:107)	0
413	Hope: Islam will eventually suffer the ennui every religion experiences. It could happen in 500 years or more likely, a thousand years. Or perhaps in a hundred if Muslims are fortunate. But it will happen. Fanatics always run out of gas. that is a very optimistic idea! Yet the source of fanaticism, the Koran, is a handbook of affirmations, a prescription to unleash the inner psychopath. Nobody runs out of ÂsteamÂ as long as thereÂs fuel and water around. The ÂfuelÂ is the Koran the water is the everyday discomfort people have with life, their neighbors and and themselves.	1
414	At the time of Prophet Muhammad, women themselves were an object of inheritance because they were considered to be part of the possessions of a man. Pre-Islamic Arabs were not the only community to have such views. The QurÂan, however, established the right of women to a share in inheritance and indeed determined the shares that male and female heirs of the deceased should have. This ÂdeterminedÂ share is calculated by Allah Himself in His wisdom and cannot be changed, and any will that recommends the exclusion of a particular heir renders it null and void. There is a verse in the QurÂan detailing the Islamic position on inheritance that was revealed in response to a complaint made by a Muslim woman to the Prophet: her brother-in-law had taken the whole of her recently deceased husbandÂs property, even though she had two daughters	0
415	Can We Consider His Marriage to `AÂishah a Case of Child Molestation? To answer your speculation, letÂs continue our objective trip into the past. Obviously, when traveling back in time 1400 years to examine a lifestyle we never witnessed, it is unfair to apply our present day standards, so letÂs listen to the experts. Authentic historical records prove that the social traditions of the time and placeÂregardless of religionÂconsidered Arab females as women as soon as their menstrual cycles began. The custom was to give daughters in marriage at that age. This was practiced by all dwellers in Arabia before Islam: pagans, disbelievers, Jews, and others. ItÂs a fact that female menstruation in hot climates starts much earlier than in cold climates, so females in Arabia matured as early as 8 or 9; they also aged earlier than other women. ItÂs a neglected fact that before she was married to Muhammad, `AÂishah had been engaged to an infidel, Jubair ibn MusÂab ibn Ady. Her fiancÃ© broke the engagement on the basis of religious difference. So her father, Abu Bakr, agreed to give her hand in marriage to the Prophet.	0

The Two Sahihs record that the Messenger of Allah said three times to the spouses who said the Mula`anah; (You have no money. If you are the one who said the truth, the dowry is in return for the right to have sexual intercourse with her. If you are the one who uttered the lie, then this money is even farther from your reach.).

421	We have already seen how Islam permits eating with the People of the Book, sharing the meat they slaughter, and marrying their women, marriage being a relationship of mutual love and mercy.

437	Allah tells us about the followers of these various religions, the believers (Muslims) and others such as the Jews and Sabians. We have already seen a definition of them in Surat Al-Baqarah and have noted how people differ over who they are. There are also the Christians, Majus and others who worship others alongside Allah. Allah will (judge between them on the Day of Resurrection) with justice; He will admit those who believed in Him to Paradise and will send those who disbelieved in Him to Hell, for He is a Witness over their deeds, and He knows all that they say and all that they do in secret, and conceal in their breast.	0
438	The scholars of the Hanafi, the Shafi`i and the Hanbali Madhhabs rely on this Hadith to allow eating parts of the slaughtered animals of the Jews that they prohibit for themselves, such as the fat. They used this Hadith as evidence against the scholars of the Maliki Madhhab who disagreed with this ruling. A better proof is the Hadith recorded in the Sahih that the people of Khaybar gave the Prophet a gift of a roasted leg of sheep, which they poisoned. The Prophet used to like eating the leg of the sheep and he took a bite from it, but it told the Prophet that it was poisoned, so he discarded that bite. The bite that the Prophet took effected the palate of his mouth, while Bishr bin Al-Bara' bin Ma`rur died from eating from that sheep. The Prophet had the Jewish woman, Zaynab, who poisoned the sheep, killed. Therefore, the Prophet and his Companions wanted to eat from that sheep and did not ask the Jews if they removed what the Jews believed was prohibited for them, such as its fat. Allah's statement, (and your food is lawful to them.) means, you are allowed to feed them from your slaughtered animals. Therefore, this part of the Ayah is not to inform the People of the Scriptures that they are allowed to eat our food -- unless we consider it information for us about the ruling that they have -- i. e, that they are allowed all types of foods over which Allah's Name was mentioned, whether slaughtered according to their religion or otherwise. The first explanation is more plausible. So it means: you are allowed to feed them from your slaughtered animals just as you are allowed to eat from theirs, as equal compensation and fair treatment. The Prophet gave his robe to `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, who was wrapped with it when he died. They say that he did that because `Abdullah had given his robe to Al-`Abbas when Al-`Abbas came to Al-Madinah.	0
439	"Allah also revealed to MohammedÂ. If one is quoting from an early Meccan Surah and there is a contradicting Surah given later in Medina, the Meccan quote is no longer valid. It is abrogated. This is called the Doctrine of Abrogation. This abrogation applies to 60% of the Quran. The early peaceful Surahs of Mecca no longer apply, but they are still in the Quran! And the Quran is not written in chronological order, so the reader canÂt say which Surah is applicable. So individual peace-loving Muslims can claim Islam to be peaceful! And Medina Muslim followers can justify violence and killing! All in the name of Allah. The unpleasant truth is that the Quran teaches the ""truly faithful"" Muslims to be at war with non-Muslims until they are all subdued. That is one wacky religion."	1

441	Deprived and treated as inferior throughout historical epochs and civilizations, Islam brought about significant changes to women along with their status, function, and, hence, rights. The cardinal Islamic doctrines concerning women are the following: First, that women are equal counterparts to men in humanity is the keystone in assessing the cross-sex relations before the Maker. And that the ÂsinÂ (otherwise known as EveÂs sin) is not the responsibility of the woman but both Adam and Eve share it is a second principle. Third, both man and woman equally follow the same assessment on their deeds before the divine. Forth, the grief that accompanies the birth of a female along with the tradition of burying her alive were prohibited and frowned upon due to the direct orders of Islam. Actually, this was a normal tradition in Arabia before the appearance of Islam.	0
442	(Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth, when or how you will,), (From the front or from behind, as long as that occurs in the Farj (vagina).).

(. ..and send for your own selves beforehand.) meaning, by performing the acts of worship while refraining from whatever Allah has prohibited for you. This is why Allah said afterwards: (And fear Allah, and know that you are to meet Him (in the Hereafter),) meaning, He will hold you accountable for all of your deeds.	0

444	"The only way ""one direction"" to pray to Mecca would make sense is on a flat earth! But then, did the Quran know the earth us round? Let's see... One of the biggest scientific mistakes in the Quran, the Quran claims the earth is flat. To name few all backed by Hadith the confirms Muhammad truly believed the earth is flat. All that narration and translations were put under the ""carpet"" in the 1960's when man landed on the moon. Mashallah. Dr Joker Zakri, pressed again and again that the Quran has a major problem, invented the suggestion that verse 79:30 suggests the Dahaha means ostrich egg. What a load of bullshit! Anyone with basic Arabic knowledge can tell Dahaha is a verb and not a noun. And well informed Arabs will tell you it means spreading , like when we spread bread. In fact, this meme was translated from Arabic. Under pressure to come up with any explanation the Quran has 11 verses that says the earth is flat, people like Zakri tried to twist meaning ...problem is that it is hard to twist flat with round. And even egg shaped, is wrong ...the earth is slightly oval but nowhere egg shaped."	1

So, my father went to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and said, I have given a gift to my son from `Amra bint Rawaha, but she ordered me to make you as a witness to it, O Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him)! Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) asked, Have you given (the like of it) to everyone of your sons? He replied in the negative. Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him)) said, Be afraid of Allah, and be just to your children. My father then returned and took back his gift.	0
447	WomenÂs right to life: In the pre-Islamic era, injustice and barbarism prevailed, which led the Arabs to deny women their right to life, so they killed her in a hideous way that indicates the absence of mercy and humanity, and the humiliation of women and their destiny, and that was her death while she was still a child, so she was buried alive. Under the dirt to death, Islam has forbidden this crime, as God Almighty said: (And if the female child was asked for what sin she was killed), the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, made the killing of girls one of the greatest sins, and he prohibited that. On the authority of Abdullah bin Masoud, he said: God, which sins are greater? He said: To make a rival to God and He created you. I said: Then which? He said: To kill your son for fear that he will eat with you.	0
448	The Command to have Taqwa, a Reminder about Creation, and Being Kind to Relatives: Allah commands His creatures to have Taqwa of Him by worshipping Him Alone without partners. He also reminds to them of His ability, in that He created them all from a single person, Adam, peace be unto him. (And from him He created his wife) Hawwa' (Eve), who was created from Adam's left rib, from his back while he was sleeping. When Adam woke up and saw Hawwa', he liked her and had affection for her, and she felt the same toward him. An authentic Hadith states, (And from them both He created many men and women;) means, Allah created from Adam and Hawwa' many men and women and distributed them throughout the world in various shapes, characteristics, colors and languages. In the end, their gathering and return will be to Allah. (And have Taqwa of Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and revere the wombs), protect yourself from Allah by your acts of obedience to Him. (Surely, Allah is always watching over you.) means, He watches all your deeds and sees your every circumstance.	0
449	Women are often brought into the picture when discussing Islam because their status Â if not studied thoroughly and objectively Â is severely misunderstood. Under those inaccurate assumptions, Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is often accused of practicing and encouraging unjust treatment of women, while the truth is actually the opposite Â as I hope you will see after reading this answer. IÂm encouraged by your thoughtful, questioning nature to attempt to crystallize the true picture of this great man. LetÂs take an objective peek into his life, to examine whether or not Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is that repelling womanizer.	0

But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you."" (John 14:26).Was Muhammad ""Holy"" and a ""Ghost""? No. Muhammad was EVIL - he killed, raped, lied, beheaded, pedophile, war-monger, etc. Muhammad was a man - he was not a ÂGhostÂ neither was he ""Holy"". Neither did he talk about the Words of Jesus in the Bible. Howbeit when He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth: for He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak: and He will shew you things to come.

And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance."" (Acts 2:1-4). How can Muhammad be the Holy Ghost in Jesus' day (33 AD), when he was born in 570 AD? This is a human impossibility! And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost."" (Acts 13:52). Did Muhammad create the World with God? (SHIRK)? In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep.

We also beg Allah for our well-being in this life and the Hereafter and for His forgiveness, mercy and pardon. Allah then mentions His kindness, generosity and mercy in accepting the good deeds from His servants, whether male or female, with the condition that they embrace the faith.

456	Terrorism has been an inherent part of Islam since the time of Muhammad about 1400 years back. Verses of Quran kept on giving threat of death, plunder of properties, and violation of women to non-Muslims. The followers of Islam have been perpetrating those inhuman atrocities on non-Muslims as religious obligation since 1400 years. Islam divides humans sharply into two camps: (1) Muslims or Momins and (2) non-Muslim or Kafirs. The Islamic terrorism of recent time started with 1972 Munich Summer Olympic massacre. Since then it has been a continuous phenomenon across the world.	1

According to Islam, Allah is the God of the entire world and Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is a messenger for the whole of mankind. According to Islam, all men are equal, whatever be their color, language, race or nationality. Islam addresses itself to the conscience of humanity and banishes all false barriers of race, status and wealth. There can be no denying the fact that such barriers have always existed, and do exist even today in this so-called enlightened age. Islam, however, removes all these impediments and proclaims the idea of the whole of humanity being one family of God.	0

463	When Islam came, it looked at the woman as a soul and a body, with her humanity and dignity, and she had the same rights as men, in terms of respect and care. Inheritance, good upbringing and education. The education of women in Islam is not different from the education of men. The first thing that revelation began with was the call to learn to read and write without discrimination between the sexes.	0
464	"This is why most of the scholars said that it is allowed to fondle the wife, except for having sexual intercourse (when she is having her menses). Abu Dawud reported that `Ikrimah related to one of the Prophet's wives that she said that whenever the Prophet wanted to fondle (one of his wives) during her menses, he would cover her sexual organ with something. Abu Ja`far bin Jarir related that Masruq went to `A'ishah and greeted her, and `A'ishah greeted him in return. Masruq said, ""I wish to ask you about a matter, but I am shy.'' She replied, ""I am your mother and you are my son.'' He said, ""What can the man enjoy of his wife when she is having her menses'' She said, ""Everything except her sexual organ.'' This is also the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and `Ikrimah. One is allowed to sleep next to his wife and to eat with her (when she is having her menses). `A'ishah said, ""Allah's Messenger used to ask me to wash his hair while I was having the menses. He would lay on my lap and read the Qur'an while I was having the period.'' It is also reported in the Sahih that `A'ishah said, ""While having the menses, I used to eat from a piece of meat and give it to the Prophet who would eat from the same place I ate from. I used to have sips of a drink and would then give the cup to the Prophet who would place his mouth where I placed my mouth.'' It is also reported in the Two Sahihs that Maymunah bint Al-Harith Al-Hilaliyah said, ""Whenever the Prophet wanted to fondle any of his wives during the periods (menses), he used to ask her to wear an Izar (a sheet covering the lower-half of the body).'' These are the wordings collected by Al-Bukhari. Similar was reported from `A'ishah. In addition, Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah reported that `Abdullah bin Sa`d Al-Ansari asked Allah's Messenger , ""What am I allowed of my wife while she is having her menses'' He said, ""What is above the Izar (a sheet covering the lower-half of the body).''

In numerous verses in the QurÂan, compulsion in religion is forbidden: [There shall be no coercion in matters of faith.] (Al-Baqarah 2:256) [And so (O Prophet), exhort them; your task is only to exhort. You cannot compel them (to believe). As for one who turns away, being bent on denying the truth, him or her will God cause the greatest suffering (in the life to come). For verily, unto Us will be their return, and verily, it is for Us to call them to account.] (Al-Ghashiyah 88:21-26) [Had your Lord so willed, all those who live on earth would surely have attained faith, will you then compel people, against their will, to believe?] (Yunus 10:99).	0
467	Do Muslims need anything clearer than this to discern that MuhammadÂs Lord is Satan? Is this not a clear testimony in the QurÂan that Allah is Satan? This is an irrefutable admission in the QurÂan that Allah is Satan. Allah responded instinctively without hesitation because that is who he truly is. Allah took issue with the womenÂs remark that he has forsaken Muhammad but not with the more serious offense of being labeled as Satan. He finds nothing wrong in being identified as such. He did not voice a single word of objection against the womanÂs more serious offense of branding him as Satan. Had Allah remained silent altogether, there would not be much to argue. However, since Allah viewed the incident serious enough to warrant a response in the QurÂan, why did he not respond to the more severe charge brought on against him by the woman? Well, one thing that is made absolutely clear in the QurÂan is that Allah alias Satan did not forsake Muhammad. Or is it Satan  alias Allah? At times, even the most cautious serpent lets the truth slip out. This disclosure of the true identity of Allah in the QurÂan should not surprise us. The existence of many evil teachings in Islam is sufficient to reveal who Allah truly is. We will conclude this segment of the article by asking Muslims the following thought-provoking questions: Who would be happy when we sin? God or Satan?	1

472	 Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their husbands), and guard in the husbandÂs absence what Allah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husbandÂs property, etc.). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great.	0

477	And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I`tikaf in the Masjids.) meaning, `Do not touch your wives as long as you are in I`tikaf, whether you were in the mosque or outside of it'.'' It is also the opinion of several other scholars, that the Muslims used to have sexual intercourse with the wife while in I`tikaf if they departed the mosque until the Ayah was revealed. Ibn Abu Hatim commented that the Ayah means, `Do not touch the wife while in I`tikaf.''' What Ibn Abu Hatim reported from these people is the agreed upon practice among the scholars. Those who are in I`tikaf are not allowed to have sexual intercourse as long as they are still in I`tikaf in the mosque. If one has to leave the mosque to attend to a need, such as to relieve the call of nature or to eat, he is not allowed to kiss or embrace his wife or to busy himself with other than his I`tikaf. He is not even allowed to visit ailing persons, but he can merely ask about their condition while passing by. I`tikaf has several other rulings that are explained in the books (of Fiqh), and we have mentioned several of these rulings at the end of our book on Siyam (Fasting), all praise is due to Allah. Furthermore, the scholars of Fiqh used to follow their explanation of the rules for fasting with the explanation of the rules for I`tikaf, as this is the way these acts of worship were mentioned in the Qur'an. By mentioning I`tikaf after fasting, Allah draws attention to practicing I`tikaf during the month of the fast, especially the last part of the month. The Sunnah of Allah's Messenger is that he used to perform I`tikaf during the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan until he died. Afterwards, the Prophet's wives used to perform I`tikaf as the Two Sahihs recorded from `A'ishah the Mother of the believers. It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Safiyyah, the daughter of Huyai, went to Allah's Messenger to visit him in the mosque while he was in I`tikaf. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her back home, as it was night. Her house was at Usamah bin Zayd's house on the edge of Al-Madinah. While they were walking, two Ansari men met them and passed by them in a hurry, for they were shy to bother the Prophet while he was walking with his wife.	0
478	Is ÂRamaÂ and ÂRama-danÂ related? ItÂs a well known fact in Hinduism that if sacred mantras, text or chants are pronounced wrong Â they become counter productive and even turn destructive. It is confirmed from the Sirath and Hadiths that Islam was created during Ramadan. Since Islam was created during Ramadan, it indicates that some festivity was prevalent pre-Islam carrying the name Ramadan and served as some form of inspiration to create a new faith. However, why does the Muslim festivity in preparation for war contain the name RAMA, a name for one of the main Hindu incarnations said to have lived over 10,000 years ago, and widely celebrated in annual festivals? This is an indication that tribal criminal Mohammed likely tried to utilize the ancient rituals for success in his raids. Rama-dan today is a festivity where Muslims ÂpurifyÂ themselves to prepare for war. Its a time when terrorist attacks on mosques and people increases ten fold. Idol worship within Islam Although Islam forbids idol worship (a remnant from advaita, also known as non-dualism), and very strictly so, Muslims worship the black stone in the Kaaba and perform rituals around it.	1
479	Sadly, and despite the best intentions of many decent people who are Muslim, the Quran qualifies as hate speech on each count.	1
480	"Unlike the Old Testament prophets, Muhammad narrated petty defenses of his claim as a prophet (and even his own sanity) that are remarkably redundant. For example, no fewer than 8 passages (83:13, 27:68, 46:17, 16:24, 6:25, 26:137, 25:5 and 23:83) say that ""Allah's messenger"" is accused of repeating Âtales of the ancients,Â but that anyone who doesnÂt believe him will burn in Hell. Why wouldnÂt Allah just say it once and then use the remaining space for something more edifying? IsnÂt this more of what one would expect from an overly-defensive poseur than from an eternal revelation of God to man?"	1
481	There are many convincing evidences to reject MuhammadÂs claim as a prophet of the true God. Ironically, one of the most compelling reasons can be found in the QurÂan itself.	1

485	In the course of war, enemy soldiers are likely to be caught as prisoners. The QurÂan provides alternatives in dealing with the prisoners of war: either free them (ÂgenerosityÂ) or ransom them. The QurÂan says what means: *{Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers [in fight], smite at their necks; at length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly [on them]: thereafter [is the time for] either generosity or ransom: until the war lays down its burdens.}* (Muhammad 47:4) It is noteworthy that Allah does not give a third choice, so there is no provision for keeping enemy soldiers incarcerated in cells for abuse. And so Muslims cannot hold anybody either soldiers or civilians as Âenemy combatantsÂ in a legal limbo, to be chained or kept within cages as the leaders of the Âcivilized worldÂ do. The second option allowed in the case of prisoners of war is ransoming. This stands for a provision in the treaty following a war, for the release of the prisoners on certain conditions, such as the payment of compensation, exchange of prisoners, and so on. But undoubtedly, for fighting as an enemy soldier, no human should be put behind bars for an indefinite period.	0
486	Islamic legislation shows us the opposite and proves that Islam has exaggerated its humiliation of women to the extreme. Rather, it violated her humanity and dignity and degraded her value. We do not disagree that all religions and divine legislations have violated the rights of women and made them a sexual object and nothing more.!	1

489	The Quran confuses Mary the mother of Jesus with Mary the sister of Aaron (and Moses) in verses 19:27 and 66:12.

Thereupon Hisham said: I bear testimony to the fact that I heard Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) as saying: Allah would torment those who torment people in the world.	0
492	We can categorize all his marriages under two aspects of his personality: Â Muhammad the man who needed a loving wife, children, and a stable home, so he married Khadijah and remained with only her for 20 years until she died. Â Muhammad the Prophet who married the other wives for reasons pertaining to his duty to deliver the Message to the world. Those particular women were carefully selected, not just haphazardly ÂacquiredÂ for carnal reasons, as suggested. Here are some of the reasons for which Muhammad married: 1. To pass on Islam to the next generations as a practical legacy Prophet Muhammad is the only prophet without any privacy, and with a meticulously preserved tradition in speech and actions in all minute details of his public and private life. Preserved in the sharp minds of his wives and his Companions, those narrations comprise the Âdaily life manualÂ for Muslims to follow until the end of time. The fact that Islam was spread on the shoulders of women and preserved in their hearts is a great honor to the females of this Ummah. The books of authentic Hadith attribute more than 3,000 narrations and Prophetic traditions to his wives alone. 2. To cement the relations of the budding nation In a tribal society, it was customary to seal treaties through marrying into tribes. MuhammadÂs closest Companions later became the four caliphs who led Islam at the critical stage after his death. Two of them were the fathers of his wives `AÂishah (daughter of Abu Bakr) and Hafsa (daughter of `Umar); the other two married his daughters (`Uthman married Ruqayyah and Zainab in succession, and `Ali married Fatimah). 3. To teach Muslims compassion with women He taught them to be compassionate not just to the young and beautiful maidens, but more so to the weak and destitute widows, divorcees, orphans, and elderly women. Islam teaches that women are to be respected, protected, and cared for by their men folk. TheyÂre not to be cast out to face a harsh life alone while able men around them just pity them and do nothing to help, or worse, use their weakness to take them as mistresses! 4. To offer a practical role model to Muslims until the end of time Although many believing women often approached Muhammad offering him themselves in marriage, he politely turned down their offers. Most of his wives after the death of Khadijah were old, devoid of beauty, and previously married, except `AÂishah, who was the only young virgin. He married from other nations and religions; some were the daughters of his worst enemies, and his marriage to one woman won all her people into Islam. Regardless of his neutral feelings towards many of them, he was a model example of equal justice and kindness to them all, and he would never discriminate among them.	0
493	First, letÂs remember that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) led a life supported only by the bare minimum of necessities. His wives were not idly wasting away the hours in a luxurious harem but led a life of labor and sacrifice, while he was mostly busy away from home overseeing his numerous duties as a Prophet. So, obviously, lust was not a factor, as he wasnÂt even at home most of the time. Further, most of his marriages occurred at an age when lust is not a major factor in any manÂs life: 1. He remained single until age 25. 2. From age 25 to 50 he was faithful to only one wife, Khadijah, who bore all his children except one. She was 15 years older than him, with children from two previous marriages. She was his greatest ally when he received the Call at age 40 until she died when he was 50 years old. He remained in love with her until he died and often talked of his life with her with great nostalgia. 3. Between ages 50 and 52 he remained unmarried and mourning his late beloved wife. He lived alone with his daughters. 4. Between ages 53 and 60 he married all his other wives for many noble reasons detailed below. ItÂs unimaginable for a man to suddenly turn lustful at this age, especially as he was constantly traveling, with bloodthirsty enemies on his heels. 5. At age 60, Allah revealed to him verse preventing him from marrying any more until he died, which was at age 63. The QurÂan says what means: *{It is not lawful for you (to marry other) women after this, nor to change them for other wives.}* (Al-Ahzab 33:52).	0

Romans 1:20-25 [20]For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: [21]Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. [22]Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, [23]And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things [24]Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: [25]Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.	1
498	(Reference point in Quran: SURA 3:106 AND SURA 39:60) On the Day when (some) faces will be WHITENED and (some) faces will be BLACKENED ; and as for those whose faces have been BLACKENED , it will be said unto them: Disbelieved ye after your (profession of) belief? Then taste the punishment for that ye disbelieved. (Ãl 'Imran 3:106) And on the Day of Resurrection thou (Muhammad) seest those who lied concerning Allah with their faces BLACKENED . Is not the home of the scorners in hell? (Az-Zumar 39:60). What has always interested me is a person of race (black person) identifying as a Muslim... I mean Islam has proven to discriminate against black people from the time of Muhammad!!. Unlike Christianity, being a Muslim means that you have to put your race and culture as second class and have to embrace another culture (Arab). When you become a Muslim you have to learn Arabic so that you can read God's word or even pray!!!! In Christianity, Jesus teaches us to worship him in spirit and truth, that means whichever culture you come from you can worship the true GOD because HE is the one who created ALL Cultures AND LANGUAGES. When I see a black brother/sister throwing away his culture and start dressing like an Arab and even talking like an Arab it pains me so much at how Islam erodes other cultures. On top of that, the racism is just too much!! How can you be a fellow black brother and support a man that called another black man a raisin head?? Why would a so called prophet of God be uttering racial slurs?? The Islamic Allah even says that black people were created for HELL.. that means any black Muslim should FORGET ever entering Janna. Did I forget to mention that the most hated person is a BLACK Man?? ... Apparently, Muslims even say Noah was a racist according to their own books.  Shem, the son of Noah was the father of the Arabs, the Persians, and the Greeks; Ham was the father of the Black Africans; and Japheth was the father of the Turks and of Gog and Magog who were cousins of the Turks. Noah prayed that the prophets and apostles would be descended from Shem and kings would be from Japheth. He prayed that the AfricanÂs color would change so that their descendants would be slaves to the Arabs and Turks. Even the Devil was depicted as looking as a black man!! Even saying that the prophet is black straight away earned you a trip to the gallows!! You would be killed!! Here are some other sayings of famous Islamic scholars about the black race. Be the judge. 	1
499	(And the Qawa`id among women.) Sa`id bin Jubayr said that these are the women who no longer think that they can bear children, (who do not hope for marriage,) meaning, they no longer have any desire for marriage, (it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment.) meaning, they do not have to cover themselves in the same way that other women have to. (But to refrain is better for them.) means, not removing their outer garment, even though that is permissible for them, is better for them. (And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.) 	0
500	THE QURAN DOESN'T MAKE SENSE EVEN IN ARABIC; The Koran claims for itself that it is 'mubeen,' or clear.' But if you look at it, you will notice that every fifth sentence or so simply doesn't make SENSE. Many Muslims - and Orientalists - will tell you otherwise, of course, but the fact is that a fifth of the Koranic text is just INCOMPREHENSIBLE. This is what has caused the traditional anxiety regarding TRANSLATION. If the Koran is not comprehensible if it can't even be understood in ARABIC - then Ã­t's not TRANSLATABLE. People fear th?t. And since the Koran claims repeatedly to be CLEAR but obviously is NOT - as even speakers of Arabic will tell you - there is a contradÃ­ction.	1

I said: With due previously married, whereupon he said: Why did you not marry a virgin with whom you could sport? I said: Allah's Messenger, I have sisters; I was afraid that she might intervene between me and them, whereupon he said: Well and good, if it is so. A woman is married for four reasons, for her religion, her property, her status, her beauty, so you should choose one with religion. May your hands cleave to dust.	0

507	"The majority of the scientific claims that start with ""no one knew about this at the time"" - are found to be not true. While some may have been recently ""reconfirmed"" like: ""all life comes from water"" or "" Iron came from other planets not from Earth"" are all mentioned in past literature, several thousands years before Islam. That is why the people of that time did not challenge Muhammad on it or sounded ""surprised"" or claimed ""oh this does not make sense"". Ancient civilisations noticed that meteorite are made of iron and Mecca has a meteorite - it is the Blackstone! Water was easy to spot as source of life, specially for desert dwellers.  Finally, when the Quran gets is so wrong that there is just no way out of it, they'll just lie. Take the fact that the Quran says in 11 verses that the Earth is like carpet, sheet, bed, and cover - all says Earth is flat - a big debating point between theists and atheists of that time who challenged ancient Greece pagans who suggested Earth is round. When there is not once single verse that says that, invent a new meaning. So verse 79:30 that used the word ""Dahaha"" an Arabic word used to ""spread like a dough"", the likes of Dr Joker Zakri claimed it means ""ostrich egg""! Yet, even Quran.com and every single translation disagrees."	1
508	Jihad is an Arabic term derived from the root J-H-D, which means, literally, Âto strive or exert effort.Â It is the same root from which the legal term ijtihad is derived, as ijtihad refers to the exertion of intellectual effort by scholars so as to come up with an informed religious opinion on a new issue or problem. The term jihad and similar terms derived from the same root are used in the QurÂan and Hadith.	0

510	"This is a parable that Allah made of the believers, in that, if they needed to, their association with the disbelievers will not harm them. Allah the Exalted said, (Let not the believers take the disbelievers as protecting friends instead of the believers, and whoever does that, will never be helped by Allah in any way, except you indeed fear a danger from them.) Qatadah said, ""Fir`awn was the most tyrannical among the people of the earth and the most disbelieving. By Allah! His wife was not affected by her husband's disbelief, because she obeyed her Lord. Therefore, let it be known that Allah is the Just Judge Who will not punish anyone except for their own sins.'' Ibn Jarir recorded that Sulayman said, ""The wife of Fir`awn was tortured under the sun and when Fir`awn would finish the torture session, the angels would shade her with their wings. She was shown her house in Paradise.'' Ibn Jarir said that Al-Qasim bin Abi Bazzah said, ""Fir`awn's wife used to ask, `Who prevailed' When she was told, `Musa and Harun prevailed', she said, `I believe in the Lord of Musa and Harun.' Fir`awn sent his aides to her and said to them, `Find the biggest stone. If she insists on keeping her faith, throw the stone on her, otherwise she is my wife. When they came to her, she looked up to the sky and was able to see her house in Paradise. She persisted on the faith and her soul was then captured. The stone was thrown on her lifeless body."	0

Take for example when he was asked about the  End time.

514	"The Quran is full of metaphorical descriptions, which means one can make out anything out of it. Ultimately, Dawah people are looking for someone who is ready for the bind faith test based on one or two arguments. You pass it, you are in. The key test is actually going ahead with the Shahada, which is in effect saying you witness that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his messanger. But have you really been a witness to testify to this? No. But since you are ready to believe stuff you cannot see, how much harder is it going to be to get you accept vague stuff in the Quran you cannot see or if you research them yourself, you will find they don't make sense. Take a recent argument I had with a new Dawah guy on my page. He scrolled nearly four weeks down my posts to pick on one where I question how the Sun can go to a place and knee to Allah waiting for permission to raise again .. this is clearly a serious scientific errors as the Sun is fixed and we rotate around it....so how can the Sun ""go anywhere to knee to Allah"" this is clearly a desert dweller view from Earth and confirms many mistakes we see in the Quran. He argued that the ""meaning"" suggest to is always kneeing and asking permission, which is not. Related it to how a verse ""miraculously"" predicted the big bang when it says the sky and earth where one and it split...I pointed to the fact the Quran also said that Earth was created first ""then"" the sky. He challenged me saying my interpretation of the Quran is most definitely wrong. I gave him the verses and not heard from him in four days - he even stopped his posting new posts on his Dawah pages!  And there you have it. There are many pages found online set up by people who left the faith, books on Amazon, and YouTube videos taking about scientific errors, morality and logical problems in Islam that shows all the garbage."	1

516	The Quran makes a lot of claims about itself. It says that it is the perfect and incorruptible revelation of God to man, and that it is so important that it has existed eternally on tablets in heaven. Critics claim that it is a badly-arranged collection of quotations from one man, passed off as the word of God to a gullible audience in a primitive society.  When accused of being a madman, for example, Muhammad would go into his tent and then emerge with a pearl 'from Allah' like, ÂYou (Muhammad) are not a madmanÂ (68:2). The people would then take this as proof that he was not. Some Muslims say that the Quran would not be believed by so many today if it were not true. But belief does not make truth Â particularly when it has to be shamelessly enforced with discrimination, maiming and death. In fact, most Muslims have never read the Quran, a book they (nonetheless) are willing to kill and die over.  Their conviction is based on what they hear from other Muslims, particularly as they are growing up. An objective reader would almost certainly conclude that the Quran is less a product of divine origin than MuhammadÂs imagination and the circumstances in which he found himself.	1

519	We believe in the total separation of Islam and the planet: The total abandonment of Islam by Muslims -  an intellectual jihad against the Quran and the Sunna of this madman. This book and the Sunna are the inspiration and religious justification for Muslim men to kill. As stated countless times in this work, the Quran is not the teachings of a God of Moral Perfection but of Muhammad and therefore it is a fraudulent book of mass evil, of mass murder and Islam is fraudulent. We donÂt care if Muslims pray 5 times a day or 24 times a day, fast one month or 12 months a year, go on pilgrimage once in a lifetime or a dozen times.  But this book - the Quran and the evil ideology of Islam must be totally ostracized by the West.  Ostracization of Islam from society not itÂs inclusion is the key to destroying Islam. You cannot accommodate, cater to, coexist with evil in a free society otherwise The Evil will overpower and conquer The Good.	1

529	RAPE OR CONSENSUAL SEX? MUHAMMAD AND SAFIYYA BINT HUYAI: Among the women who were taken as captives was an eighteen year old Safiyya. SafiyyaÂs father was Huyai. He was killed in the attack. Kinana was a wealthy man who looked after the wealth of the city. He was beheaded by the commands of Muhammad but not after he was torture with fire to reveal where he kept the treasures of the city. [see ibn Ishaq 515] Kinana was the husband of Safiyya bint Huyai. So in just one day, Safiyya lost both her Father and husband. There came the Muslim soldiersÂ favorite part of war: Sharing the captive women! A Muslim man named Dihya chose Safiyya for himself. Muhammad seeing the beauty of Safiyya ordered Dihya to choose any other woman apart from Safiyya for he, (Muhammad) better deserve such beauty. [see sahih bukhari 1:8:367] Muhammad just couldnÂt wait to have sex with this poor woman whose husband and father he had just brutally murdered. Heading back home, just at the road side, between Khaiba and Madina, Muhammad pegged his tent, and had sex with Safiyya. [see sahih bukhari 7:62:22].	1

Why the whole tribe? This story makes more sense that the tribe,.after feeling worse and not better from drinking camel urine, told Muhammad to ""f# k off"" and made a joke of him in front of other people Muhammad did not like that, ordered their punishment but that the.story will cast the messenger of peace and love as a barbarian that he is, either he or the people around ""spiced.up"" the story to make it look justifiable.

Almighty Allah describes this situation as follows: ÂYet thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease racing toward them (the enemies of Islam), saying, ÂWe are afraid that a change of fortune may befall us.Â But it may be that Allah will give (thee) the victory or some decision from Himself, and then they will become regretful for what they thought secretly within themselves.Â (Al-MaÂidah 5:52). Allah also says the following: ÂGive to the hypocrites the tidings that they will have a grievous punishment.

536	(...and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs,) meaning, of pregnancy or menstruation periods. This is the Tafsir of Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hakam bin `Utaybah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah then said: (...if they believe in Allah and the Last Day.). This Ayah warns women against hiding the truth (if they were pregnant or on their menses), indicating that they are the authority in such matters as they alone know such facts about themselves. Since verifying such matters is difficult, Allah left this decision with them. Yet, women were warned not to hide the truth in case they wish to end the `Iddah sooner, or later, according to their desires. Women were thus commanded to say the truth (if they were pregnant or on their menses), no more and no less. (And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation.). Hence, the husband who divorces his wife can take her back, providing she is still in her `Iddah (time spent before a divorced woman or a widow can remarry) and that his aim, by taking her back, is righteous and for the purpose of bringing things back to normal. However, this ruling applies where the husband is eligible to take his divorced wife back. We should mention that, the ruling that made the divorce thrice and specified when the husband is ineligible to take his divorced wife back, had not been revealed yet. Previously, the man used to divorce his wife and then take her back even if he had divorced her a hundred separate times. Thereafter, Allah revealed that made the divorce only thrice. So there was now a reversible divorce and an irreversible final divorce. (And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable,) This Ayah indicates that the wife has certain rights on her husband, just as he has certain rights on her, and each is obliged to give the other spouse his due rights.	0

539	DoesnÂt the QurÂan state that Muslims should never take Jews and Christians for friends? Answer: This is an incorrect translation in the first place. The QurÂan does not tell Muslims not to take Jews and Christians as friends. The word used in the QurÂan is awliyaaÂ, which means ÂoverlordsÂ or Âprotectors,Â not mere friends. If we look at the verses that deal with this injunction, we will notice that they always refer to negative situations. For example, in Al-MaÂidah 5:57-58, the context refers to those who mock you as Muslims when you call for Prayers. Would any sane person of any religion take as their defender one who mocks them in this way? It is not appropriate to view these verses in isolation, since there are many verses that teach how peaceful relationships should be developed with non-Muslims. Coming back to the question of marriage, which is more intimate, the marital relationship or friendship? According to the QurÂan (Al-MaÂidah 5:5), a Muslim man can marry a Jewish or Christian woman. As a wife, her Muslim husband has obligations to her. As revealed in Surah 30, Ar-Rum, (The Romans), verse 22, he should dwell with her in peace and treat her with love and compassion. Does it make sense that a Muslim would be permitted to marry a non-Muslim, but not befriend her?	0
540	Malik related to me from Rabia ibn Abd ar-Rahman that az-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam bought a slave and set him free. The slave had children by a free woman. When az-Zubayr freed him, he said, They are my mawali. The man argued, They are the mawali of their mother. Rather, they are our mawali. They took the dispute to Uthman ibn Affan, and Uthman gave a judgement that az-Zubayr had their wala'. Malik related to me that he had heard that Said ibn al-Musayyab was asked who had the wala' of the children whom a slave had by a free woman. Said said, If their father dies and he is a slave who was not set free, their wala' belongs to the mawali of their mother. Malik said, That is like the child of a woman who is a mawla who has been divorced by lian; the child is attached to the mawali of his mother and they are his mawali. If he dies, they inherit from him. If he commits a crime, they pay the blood-money for him. If his father acknowledges him, he is given a kinship to him and his wala' goes to the mawali of his father. They are his heirs, they pay his blood-money and his father is punished with the hadd-punishment. Malik said, It is like that with a free-born woman divorced by lian. If her husband who curses her by lian does not acknowledge her child, the child is dealt with in the same way except that the rest of his inheritance after the inheritance of his mother and his brothers from his mother goes to all the muslims as long as he was not given kinship to his father. The child of the lian is attached to the patronage of the mawali of his mother until his father acknowledges him because he does not have a lineage or paternal relations. If his lineage is confirmed, it goes to his paternal relations. Malik said, The generally agreed-on way of doing things among us about a child of a slave by a free woman, while the father of the slave is free, is that the grandfather (the father of the slave), attracts the wala' of his son's free children by a free woman. They leave their inheritance to him as long as their father is a slave. If the father becomes free, the wala' returns to his mawali. If he dies and he is still a slave, the inheritance and the wala' go to the grandfather. If the slave has two free sons, and one of them dies while the father is still a slave, the grandfather, the father of the father, attracts the wala' and the inheritance. Malik spoke about a slave-girl who was set free while she was pregnant and her husband was a slave and then her husband became free before she gave birth, or after she gave birth. He said, The wala' of what is in her womb goes to the person who set the mother free because slavery touched the child before the mother was set free. It is not treated in the same way as a child conceived by its mother after she has been set free because the wala' of such a child, is attracted by the father when he is set free. Malik said that if a slave asked his master's permission to free a slave of his and his master gave permission, the wala' of the freed slave went to the master of his master, and his wala' did not return to the master who had set him free, even if he were to become free himself.	0
541	From the above accounts, we can clearly see that ProphetsÂincluding MuhammadÂwere allowed to be more polygamous than their followers, not just for carnal reasons, but for political and religious reasons pertaining to their call. Consequently, it is groundless to wonder why Muslims canÂt marry 12 wives like their prophet, just as it is groundless to wonder why Jews and Christians canÂt marry 700 like theirs! Islam didnÂt invent polygamy; Islam only made polygamy more humane, instituting equal rights for all wives. And even so, Muslim women are not forced to accept this and may put a condition against it in their marriage contract. The QurÂan Is the Only Holy Book That Actually Says ÂMarry Only OneÂ Images of Âsheikhs with haremsÂ are not consistent with Islam, as, in fact, the general rule in Islam is monogamy not polygamy. the QurÂan says what means: *{Marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one.}* (An-NisaaÂ 3:3) Polygamy in Islam is not recommended; it is only permitted under certain guidelines. Permission to practice polygamy is not associated with mere satisfaction of passion. It is, rather, associated with compassion toward widows and orphans. Before the QurÂan was revealed, there was no upper limit for polygamy, and many men had more than four wives. Islam put an upper limit of four wives, permitting a man to marry more than once, only on the condition that he deal justly with all of them. Yet the same verse points out: *{Ye are never able to be fair and just as between women}* (Al-NisaaÂ 3:129) Therefore polygamy is not a rule but an exception.	0
542	Unity and universality of the core teachings of all prophets: That core message is peace in submission to Allah, literally Islam. According to the QurÂan, a Muslim must accept, revere, and believe in all the prophets of Allah, without discrimination. They all represent one brotherhood of faith extending vertically to include many generations and horizontally to embrace all humanity. In the QurÂan we read [we (Muslims) make no distinction between any of His messengers (GodÂs messengers)] (Al-Baqarah 2:285). We read also [Behold, We have revealed to you (O Muhammad) as We revealed to Noah and all the prophets after him] (Al-NisaaÂ 4:163). Still in another verse we read [In matters of faith, He (God) has ordained for you that which He had enjoined upon Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: steadfastly uphold the (true) faith and make no divisions therein] (Ash-Shura 42:13). These QurÂanic texts preclude the notion of narrow partisanship that may lead to hatred or even violence against communities who perceive themselves as followers of other prophets.	0
543	It is legitimate for a Muslim to forgive an infidel, and to forgive him for stolen goods and other rights that he has over him, and that is something that is recommended and rewarded for him, and this is not more eloquent than giving charity to an infidel, which the general scholars see as desirable and legitimate.	0
544	If you think the use of black people as slaves started with the Europeans in the 15th century, think again. Muhammad the prophet of Islam and the Arabs engaged in active enslavement of black people centuries before the Europeans set foot here in Africa	1
545	The excuse moderates and apologists give for Islamic terrorism is that these people do NOT understand Islam and therefore do not represent Islam. The problem, however, that all these people refer to the Quran as their main source and Hadith for their interpretations. All of them spend their life time studying Islam. Al Baghdadi had a PhD from Baghdad University in Islam Studies!! But you, moderates and apologists, who have an occasional understanding of few verses in the Quran but clocked up hundred of hours of PR YouTube, understand Islam a lot better. ISIS don't understand Islam, Bokoharam does not understand Islam, AlQaida does not understand Islam, Taliban does not understand Islam, the Wahhabis do not understand Islam, Muslim Brotherhood does not understand Islam, Iran and Hizbullab do not understand Islam, individual terrorist who pick up Islam on their own (or get radicalised in ever different ways) do not understand Islam.....how long do we need to keep going before you realise there is no other religion in the WORLD that has this long list of people who do NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR RELIGION to the extend that they commit genocides and terrorism! So stop being a ridiculous apologist and look at the verses we are showing that shows the Quran NEVER once says love the others but has tons of verses that says otherwise.....and as such this cannot be a religion of peace or perfect!	1
546	Which confirms the greatness of tolerance among the honorable Companions; That a Christian woman from Egypt was complaining about Amr Ibn Al-Aas to Caliph Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, because he entered part of the construction of the mosque in her house, so Omar offered her to buy her house at double the price, but she refused, so Omar ordered the demolition of the new construction of the mosque, and return her entire house to it.	0
547	I am Arab born and bred in Islam, and I can tell here there is nothing to see here. The language of the Quran is difficult, the stories are scattered all over the place, constantly praising Allah and Muhammad. Even the sequence of the chapters is confusing as they are not chronological order. It is an organised mess. Muhammad did not put it in this order, Muhammad had died some 20 years before they attempted to put this book as one piece!! He was not around to show us how the book is supposed to be!	1
548	All that opened the door for women to many choices and rights. She has the right to engage in the political life or a public office job. Also, under Islamic jurisprudence the right to vote was given to her. Employment is also her right, and all the morals and bylaws of are to grant her equality. Although many such intellectual and civil advancements were unprecedented, still, many cultural and ethnic restraints have stopped the women in the Muslim world from realizing their destiny. It is the deterioration and decadence of Islamic morals and teachings that lead to the sad reality that we in the Muslim world Â men and women alike Â share. This has backfired on women status and rights and now they are back to the same position of women in all traditional Eastern societies! Yet, to say that women are not better off nowadays as they were in the pre-Islamic days is not completely true. Of course many legal and social reforms took place and there are many groups working on both the grass-root and international level. As for the cultural distortions, which stigmatize the Muslim attitude towards women, we must dig beneath such surfaces to see the truth of the reality of women under Islamic teachings. Of course, the roots and ideological misconceptions which stemmed from the OrientalistsÃ¯?Â½ canons come to the fore. There is a gulf of difference between the cultural fallacies of life in the East made by oreintalists, and are not particular to the Muslim, but extend to all Asian civilization. In that, it is the veil, for example, which is assumed to the chief way to oppressing women. But pornography, in return, is not seen as means to the enslavement of women to their own bodies and the manly desires.	0
549	Narrated `Abdullah: The Prophet Muhammed gave (the land of) Khaibar to the Jews (of Khaibar) on condition that they would work on it and cultivate it and they would have half of its yield.	0
550	"Moderates and extremists refuse to address the problems. And this is the problem!! When all sides agree it is perfect, no progress will ever happen. And when a brainwashed and deranged idiot decides they want to take a short cut to heaven to see those 72 virgins, they pull that trigger believing 100% Islam is true because all they see is both sides agreeing it is true!. You know what would stop him doing that? If he had 0.001% doubt that maybe just MAYBE he is wrong and maybe best stay peaceful so that who ever god it turns out to be, at least he will say ""I was good and I did not hurt anyone!"" ExMuslims need to shout out online. It starts first by studying Islam carefully, reading and following former Muslims books, pages, and YouTube channels. And only when you have established good knowledge and know you are 100% safe...speak out. The more they see people like us online, the more soul searching they will have. Every voice counts."	1
551	Faith in the One Universal God (Allah in Arabic): Islam is founded on the belief that there is only one God (Allah in Arabic), Who is the universal Creator, Sustainer, and Cherisher of all. Being the sole creator of all humankind precludes any notion of multiple, competing creators, each marshalling his creation against the other ÂgodsÂ and their creation. Allah is One and is impartial toward His creation. He provides for all, including those who reject faith in Him or even those who defy Him. He cares for the well-being of all and gives them ample opportunity to repent to Him and end the state of separateness suffered by those who reject Him or are unmindful of Him. This belief implies that all humans are equal before Allah in terms of their humanity, irrespective of their particular beliefs. Only Allah is the ultimate judge of any personÂs Âtheological correctness.Â No human should be oppressed or mistreated by other fellow humans because of a perceived Âtheological incorrectness.Â	0
552	And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect	0
553	In principle, non-Muslims are not to be given any zakah funds but they can be given sadaqah (optional charity). An exception to this ruling is when it is a matter of life and death. In this specific case zakah can be given to non-Muslims. A portion of zakah can also be given to non-Muslims whose hearts are inclined towards Islam.	0
554	We have been told that the Apostle of Allah once mentioned al-Uzza saying, ÂI have offered a white sheep to al-ÂUzza, while I was a follower of the religion of my people.Â Al-ÂUzza was one of the female deities worshipped by the Quraysh pagans. Muhammad who belonged to this tribe was once a worshipper of this pagan idol. And he made sacrifices to this pagan idol. MuhammadÂs roots began in paganism. Muslims should ponder deeply on these vital evidences regarding their Prophet. The evidences presented here and in our past episodes (and many more coming), from sources of Islam itself prove that Muhammad cannot be a chosen prophet of the true God. God would not choose his final prophet from a pagan source. And this would automatically disqualify Islam as a religion of the true God. This is THE END of THE EVIL BEGINNING OF ISLAM series What we have discussed so far is only the tip of the iceberg. There are many more shocking evidences to thoroughly prove that Islam cannot be the religion of mankindÂs Creator. Islam has many dark secrets. It is built on lies and it is allergic to truth. Islam planted its own seed of destruction when it relied on deceit to spread its teachings. Therefore, it is vital to expose the lies of Islam. It is our contention that honest Muslims must be fully informed.	1
555	Justice is a universal concept that should be observed without nepotism, even with the ÂenemyÂ: [O you who believe! Stand out for justice, as witnesses to Allah, and even as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor.] (An-NisaaÂ 4:134). [O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allah, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: that is next to piety and fear Allah, for Allah is well acquainted with all that you do.] (Al-MaÂidah 5:8) The above concept of universal justice relates to peace in at least two ways: 1. It is inconceivable to secure genuine lasting peace without justice. In fact, doing justice is a prerequisite to peace. 2. To harm, persecute, or fight against any person on account of his or her religious convictions is one of the worst forms of injustice, which is condemned in the primary sources of Islam. Universal human brotherhood: Addressing the entire human race, the QurÂan states, [O humankind! We (Allah) have created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female and have made you into nations and tribes, so that you may come to know one another. Verily, the most honored of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous (or Allah-conscious) of you. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.] (Al-Hujurat 49:13).	0
556	MUHAMMAD: THE WORLD MOST OBVIOUS FALSE PROPHET	1
557	Islam has given the people of the dhimmis full rights, and gave them freedom to enter into Islam, and commanded kindness to them in dealings, and fairness with them. When the Prophet - may GodÂs prayers and peace be upon him - emigrated and found a large number of Jews in Medina, he made covenants that define the relationship with them on the principle of tolerance and guarantee their rights. Some of the People of the Book were next to the Prophet - may God bless him and grant him peace. It is given to him by them.	0
558	These became known as Meccian verses and Madina verses. We have our own theory here. Muhammad in Mecca was relying on what he learned from his maternal uncle Waraqah Ibn Nawfal, a priest in Christianity and Judaism, to invent verses in the Quran. But in Madina Muhammad was on his own and making up his own material. What changed between Mecca and Medina that Allah's *language and style* of writing would change!!! 	1
559	According to Islamic theology, all Muslims will descend into the ÂIslamic-HellÂ immediately upon their death, And they will remain there until the Day of Resurrection. Thus, Allah made a bargain with the Muslims. Allah told them if they die fighting for his cause, he will save them from the Âgrievous sufferingÂ of Hell-fire. Till today, Muslim suicide-killers are motivated by this murderous bargain of Allah. AllahÂs bargain is still in force in the QurÂan. And the assurance of Paradise for those who die murdering in the name of Allah is still the standing order in the Book of Hate. Islam calls upon Muslims to do evil to others simply because they are not Muslims. The QurÂan has turned men into cold-blooded murderers, rapists, bandits, and terrorists. Muslims commit the most evil crimes with an untroubled conscience because these violent criminal acts are sanctioned in the QurÂan. The inspiration to murder comes directly from the teachings of Allah in the QurÂan. Islam is a culture of death and destruction. Do not take our word for it. Just look at the evidences. Look around at all the acts of violence committed by Muslims around the globe. Munich, New York, Madrid, Beslan, London, Mumbai, Boston, Kenya, Paris, Brussels, Nigeria, Somalia, Syria, Iraq are just a few out of the many countries that experienced the violence of Islam. Does not this teach you something about this religion? Islam is making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Do not be misled by the deception of the Muslims when the truth about Islam is crying out on the streets. ISLAM IS NOT A RELIGION OF PEACE.	1
560	When Mohammad lusted after a married woman or a concubine, it was the duty of the husband of that woman & owner of that Concubine to hand them over to M0hammad without any price. Ref. Seerat Halbiya Urdu vol. 3 last half page 383. NOTE: Mohammad was a sIave of the devil, the same devil who gave in to his every desire and whim and called it revelation. If you can call this depraved man a prophet, do you have any spirit of discernment to differentiate between God and Satan?	1
561	The Prophet, may GodÂs prayers and peace be upon him, accepted the invitation of the Jewish woman to her food, and the sick Jewish boy returned, and he received a delegation of Christians from Najran in his mosque and honored them in it. This situation continued in the Rightly-Guided Caliphate as well, and the best evidence of this is the document that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab gave to the Christians in Jerusalem, which was called the ÂOmar CovenantÂ in which he secured them for themselves, their money, their churches, and other rights and freedoms.	0
562	It is not permissible for a Muslim to oppress a dhimmi in person, money, or honor. If he is a dhimmi, a trustee, or a covenant, then the right will lead to him, so he does not wrong him with regard to his money, neither by theft, nor by treachery, nor by cheating, nor is he wronged in his body, whether by beating or otherwise; Because being a covenant or a dhimmi in the country or a trustee protects him.	0
563	(And among His signs) indicating His magnificent power. (is the creation of the heavens and the earth,) The heavens with their vast height and brightness and beauty of the stars and planets, and the earth with its density and its mountains, valleys, seas, plains, animals and trees. (and the difference of your languages) So, we see that some speak Arabic, and the Tatars have their own language, as do the Georgians, Romans, Franks, Berbers, Tou Couleurs (of Sudan), Ethiopians, Indians, Persians, Slavs, Khazars, Armenians, Kurds and others. Only Allah knows the variety of languages spoken among the sons of Adam. And the difference of their colors mentioned here refers to their appearance, for all the people of this world, from the time that Allah created Adam, and until the Hour begins, each of them has two eyes, two eyebrows, a nose, a forehead, a mouth and two cheeks, but none of them looks like another; there is bound to be some difference in posture, appearance and speech, whether it is apparent or is hidden and can only be noticed with careful observation. Each face has its own characteristics and does not look like another; even if there was a group of people who looked alike, having a beautiful or ugly characteristic in common, there would still be a difference between one person and the next. (Verily, in that are indeed signs for men of sound knowledge.)	0
564	This point is explained in other verses, in which Allah Almighty says the following: ÂThey will spare nothing to ruin you; they yearn for what makes you suffer. Hatred has been expressed by their mouths, but what their hearts conceal is still greater. Thus have We made clear to you the revelations (or signs), if you possess understanding. Ah! You love them, but they do not love you.Â (Aal `Imran 3:118-119) This verse sheds light on the character of such people, who conceal great enmity and hatred against the Muslims in their hearts and whose tongues express some of the effects of such hostility. Almighty Allah also says the following: ÂThou wilt not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even though they may be their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kin.Â (Al-Mujadalah 58:22)	0
565	The woman also has her right in financial transactions, and she has the right to own, dispose of, gift and give alms with her money. In the hadith on the authority of Ibn Abbas: ÂThe Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, went out on the day of sacrifice, or breaking the fast, and prayed two units of prayer, he did not pray before or after it, then he came to the women and with him Bilal. So he commanded them to give alms, so the woman made her drop her waist, and she throws her noses.Â She also has the right to buy and sell and give alms. Neither my son nor my husband has any other maintenance, and they have distracted me from charity, so I cannot give anything in charity, so will I have a reward for what I spent? The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said to her: Spend on them, for you will have a reward for what you spent on them.	0
566	"(And those of your women who commit illegal sexual intercourse, take the evidence of four witnesses from among you against them; and if they testify, confine them (i.e. women) to houses until death comes to them or Allah ordains for them some (other) way.) `Some other way' mentioned here is the abrogation of this ruling that came later. Ibn `Abbas said, ""The early ruling was confinement, until Allah sent down Surat An-Nur which abrogated that ruling with the ruling of flogging (for fornication) or stoning to death (for adultery). Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said, ""When the revelation descended upon the Messenger of Allah , it would affect him and his face would show signs of strain. One day, Allah sent down a revelation to him, and when the Messenger was relieved of its strain, he said, (Take from me: Allah has made some other way for them. The married with the married, the unmarried with the unmarried. The married gets a hundred lashes and stoning to death, while the unmarried gets a hundred lashes then banishment for a year.)''"	0
567	And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of your languages and colours. Verily, in that are indeed signs for men of sound knowledge	0
568	Narrated `Aisha: The Prophet Muhammed and Abu Bakr employed a (pagan) man from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail and the tribe of Bani 'Abu bin `Adi as a guide. He was an expert guide and he broke the oath contract which he had to abide by with the tribe of Al-`Asi bin Wail and he was on the religion of Quraish pagans. The Prophet Muhammed and Abu Bakr had confidence in him and gave him their riding camels and told him to bring them to the Cave of Thaur after three days. So, he brought them their two riding camels after three days and both of them (The Prophet (PBUH) and Abu Bakr) set out accompanied by 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the Dili guide who guided them below Mecca along the road leading to the sea-shore.	0

572	According to the Quran, all peace loving Muslims, those who don't fight or drive unbelievers out of their cities are hypocrites & are close to unbelief than faith, this makes over 95% of today's Muslims. This means that the true believers of Islam must fight or they are labeled unbelievers and hypocrites. There's no middle ground, nothing like moderate Islam. So, according to the Quran, who are the true, non-hypocrite believers ? The short answer is Taliban, Al-qaeda, Boko Haram, Al-shabab...etc. The majority of Muslims are hypocrites, Allah said so.	1
573	And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the ÂIddah (prescribed period), if you have doubts (about their periods), is three months, and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their ÂIddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise, except in case of death] . And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their ÂIddah (prescribed period) is until they deliver (their burdens), and whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him.	0
574	As a religious faith, normative Islam is not identical with the actions of its Âfollowers.Â Like other religions, followers or claimed followers are imperfect, fallible human beings. There are times when their actions conform, in various degrees, to the normative teachings of their faith. But there are also times when their actions are either independent of or even in violation of such normative teachings. Outsiders may see these offending acts as part of the practice of faith. Sometimes, these acts are committed, falsely, in the name of faith. These claims are made as a result of ignorance, ÂsincereÂ misinterpretations, or even deliberate misrepresentations that are intended to provide sanction and authority for such acts. Examples of that include attempting to justify or explain the killing of innocent non-combatants by making out-of-context references to the QurÂan.	0
575	HYGIENE OF THE PROPHET: LICE: Muhammad had lice in his head and guess who used to pick them out from his head? None other than his own daughter in law cum wife, Zainab. And worse... Another man's wife also did the same to the prophet and we are here being lied to that a Muslim man cannot visit another Muslims man's wife unless the husband is around... Well in here, Muhammad visits someone else's wife and is getting spa treatment from her... 	1
576	THIS IS SHOCKING. The True Face of Islam [The religion of Pieces] The Islam preached at the mosque is different from the Islam preached to non-Muslims.	1
577	"The Qur'an contains a prophecy that wasn't fulfilled. The Qur'an presents a test for divine inspiration, but fails the test. The central argument for the inspiration of the Qur'an is the ""Argument from Literary Excellence,"" which is absurd on multiple levels. The author of the Qur'an doesn't know that Miriam, the sister of Aaron and Moses, is a different person from Mary, the mother of Jesus (because their names are the same in Arabic). The Qur'an claims that Alexander the Great and Aesop were devout Muslims. Allah promises to protect the Qur'an from corruption, but the Qur'an has been corrupted (by Muslim standards). Muslims believe that the Qur'an is Allah's eternal Word. Yet Allah repeatedly changes his eternal mind about his eternal Word via abrogation. The Qur'an is missing at least two verses in which Allah commands grown women to breastfeed grown men in order to prevent sexual misconduct. The Qur'an contains numerous false stories that were plagiarized from other sources."	1
578	"The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, A woman should not travel except with a Dhu-Mahram (her husband or a man with whom that woman cannot marry at all according to the Islamic Jurisprudence), and no man may visit her except in the presence of a Dhu-Mahram."" A man got up and said, O Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him)! I intend to go to such and such an army and my wife wants to perform Hajj. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said (to him), Go along with her (to Hajj)"	0
579	Divorce before consummating the Marriage. Allah allowed divorce after the marriage contract and before consummating the marriage. Ibn `Abbas said that `touched' (mentioned in the Ayah) means sexual intercourse. The husband is allowed to divorce his wife before consummating the marriage or giving the dowry if it was deferred.	0
580	The above injunctions include all People of the Book wherever they may be. Those people who live under the protection of an Islamic government enjoy special privileges. They are referred to as Âthe protected peopleÂ (ahl adh-dhimmah or dhimmis), meaning that Allah, His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him), and the community of Muslims have made a covenant with them that they may live in safety and security under the Islamic government. In modern terminology, dhimmis are ÂcitizensÂ of the Muslim state. From the earliest period of Islam to the present day, Muslims are in unanimous agreement that dhimmis enjoy the same rights and carry the same responsibilities as Muslims themselves, while being free to practice their own faiths.	0
581	From the ProphetÂs farewell sermon: Show fear towards God regarding women, for you have got them under GodÂs security, and have the right to intercourse with them by God's word. They must not bring into your houses anyone whom you dislike, but if they do that beat them, though not severely. You are responsible for providing them with their food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you something, i.e. GodÂs Book, by which, if you hold to it, you will never again go astray.	0
582	(The believers, men and women, are supporters of one another;) they help and aid each other. (The example of the believers in the compassion and mercy they have for each other, is the example of one body: if a part of it falls ill, the rest of the body suffers with fever and sleeplessness.) (...they enjoin good, and forbid evil), (they perform the Salah, and give the Zakah), they obey Allah and are kind to His creation, (and obey Allah and His Messenger), concerning what he commands and refraining from what he prohibits, (Allah will have mercy on them.) Therefore, Allah will give mercy to those who have these qualities, (Surely, Allah is All-Mighty), He grants glory to those who obey Him, for indeed, might and glory is from Allah Who gives it to His Messenger and the believers, (All-Wise), in granting these qualities to the believers, while giving evil characteristics to hypocrites. Surely, Allah's wisdom is perfect in all His actions; praise and glory be to Him.	0
583	Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) as saying: Let him be humbled, let him be humbled. It was said: Allah's Messenger, who is he? He said. He who finds his parents in old age, either one or both of them, and does not enter Paradise.	0
584	Allah the Exalted declares to mankind that He has created them all from a single person, `Adam, and from that person He created his mate, Hawwa'. From their offspring He made nations, comprised of tribe, which include subtribes of all sizes. It was also said that `nations refers to non-Arabs, while `tribes refers to Arabs. Various statements about this were collected in an individual introduction from the book, Al-Inbah, by Abu `Amr Ibn `Abdul-Barr, and from the book, Al-Qasad wal-Amam fi Ma`rifah Ansab Al-Arab wal-`Ajam. Therefore, all people are the descendants of `Adam and Hawwa' and share this honor equally. The only difference between them is in the religion that revolves around their obedience to Allah the Exalted and their following of His Messenger . After He forbade backbiting and belittling other people, alerting mankind that they are all equal in their humanity.	0
585	Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said, The one who looks after and works for a widow and for a poor person is like a warrior fighting for Allah's Cause. (The narrator Al-Qa'nabi is not sure whether he also said: Like the one who prays all the night without slackness and fasts continuously and never breaks his fast.)	0
586	This attitude was quite different from the behavior of the invading crusaders. When the Christian army entered Jerusalem on July 15, 1099, it slaughtered 70,000 Muslims, including women, children, and old men. They broke childrenÂs skulls by knocking them against walls, threw babies from roof tops, roasted men over fire, and cut open women bellies to see if they had swallowed gold. So wrote the famous Christian historian Edward Gibbon. (Quoted by Draper, History of the Intellectual Development of Europe, Vol. 2, p. 77.) Islam never fought nations but fought only despotic rulers. War in Islam is always for truth and justice, or, in other words, in the Way of God. Muslims must bear this in mind, and so their behavior before, during, or after a war should never violate the commands of Allah and the example of His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).	0
587	"(divorce them at their `Iddah), ""The `Iddah is made up of clean- liness and the menstrual period.'' So he divorces her while it is clear that she is pregnant, or he does not due to having sex, or since he does not know if she is pregnant or not. This is why the scholars said that there are two types of divorce, one that conforms to the Sunnah and another innovated. The divorce that conforms to the Sunnah is one where the husband pronounces one divorce to his wife when she is not having her menses and without having had sexual intercourse with her after the menses ended. One could divorce his wife when it is clear that she is pregnant. As for the innovated divorce, it occurs when one divorces his wife when she is having her menses, or after the menses ends, has sexual intercourse with her and then divorces her, even though he does not know if she became pregnant or not. There is a third type of divorce, which is neither a Sunnah nor an innovation where one divorces a young wife who has not begun to have menses, the wife who is beyond the age of having menses, and divorcing one's wife before the marriage was consummated"	0
588	Muhammad allowed his followers to hire prostitutes. When Muhammad's wife Sauda became fat and unattractive, Muhammad intended to divorce her. Sauda had to relinquish some of her marital rights to avoid being abandoned. After Muhammad got caught having sex with his slave girl in the bed of one of his wives, he swore that he would stop having sex with his slave-girl. Allah ordered him to break that oath. Muhammad claimed that women are less intelligent and less moral than men. When Muhammad's wives asked why he was giving special privileges to Aisha, he justified his actions by saying that he received revelations while wearing Aisha's dress!	1
589	Salvation for prostitutes according to the wisdom of Allah. Hello, are you a prostitute? Have you been a slave and contracted by a Muslim as a prostitute according to Quran SURA 24 33 popularly known as MUKTAABA? Are you afraid that you might not make it to strip club Janna where you can continue to offer your services but now free from charging the man? No WORRY!! we have THE SOLUTION FOR YOU.... just give water to a dog and Allah the self proclaimed Merciful will allow you Janna with all your perversion and body COUNTS!! NO NEED TO REPENT AND LIVE A RIGHTEOUS LIFE LIKE THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE SAYS. JUST GIVE WATER TO A DOG AND COME CLAIM JANNA!! 	1
590	Muslims know that Islam is a new & totally different religion of a 1 man who died & went to hell. Their quarrel over the incarnation of God or Trinity, is a distraction from truth. I challenge you, first admit that Muhammad was a false prophet, then you will easily understand that God can take human form without ceasing to be God and can be at two places at once. Save yourself from hell. Jesus died for you on the cross to give you life of abundance and true peace.	1
591	The Assault in the Cave, If you've read the hadith narration of Muhammad's first encounter with jibreel, you'll come to one conclusion; that is, Muhammad was visited by an evil spirit rather than an angel. When the supposed angel visited Muhammad in the cave, the spirit assaulted him by forcefully squeezing him till he felt like dying. Constantly asking Muhammad to read, forgetting that he was an illiterate. 	1
592	(How can there be a covenant for the Mushrikin), a safe resort and refuge, while they persist in Shirk with Allah, and disbelief in Him and His Messenger,  (except those with whom you made a covenant near Al-Masjid Al-Haram), on the day of Hudaybiyyah. Allah said in another Ayah concerning the day of Hudaybiyyah, (then stand you true to them. Verily, Allah loves those who have Taqwa.) The Messenger of Allah and the Muslims preserved the terms of the treaty with the people of Makkah from the month of Dhul-Qa`dah in the sixth year of Hijrah, until the Quraysh broke it and helped their allies, Banu Bakr, against Khuza`ah, the allies of Allah's Messenger. Aided by the Quraysh, Banu Bakr killed some of Bani Khuza`ah in the Sacred Area! The Messenger of Allah led an invasion army in the month of Ramadan, of the eighth year, and Allah opened the Sacred Area for him to rule over them, all thanks are due to Allah. The Messenger of Allah freed the Quraysh who embraced Islam after they were overpowered and defeated. These numbered around two thousands, and they were refered to by the name `Tulaqa' afterwards. Those among them who remained in disbelief and ran away from Allah's Messenger were sent promises of safe refuge for four months, during which they were allowed to move about freely. They included Safwan bin Umayyah, `Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl and many others. Allah later on guided them to Islam, and they became excellent believers. Surely, Allah is worthy of all praise for all His actions and decrees.	0
593	"The moderate apologists who are desperately trying to ""clean up"" the mess real Islamists show about women's rights, human rights, scientific errors in the Quran and Hadith...it is these people I cannot have a meaningful debate with them to the point I gave up. They will insist what is clearly authentic hadith, to be weak or fake. They would stubbornly insist certain Arabic meanings do not mean what they say, despite I am an Arab and I know the meaning of these words, the translators know the meaning of these words, and the tafsir (explanation) of the Quran explains exactly what they mean... And as we in Islam followed it for 1400 - they would reject it and turn a blind eye claiming they found a different meaning to it all. These are the people who are so desperate and pathetic...that we now call them apologists. And what do they do when they see themselves cornered? They call their followers to mass report. "	1
594	"(But if you intend to replace a wife by another and you have given one of them a Qintar, take not the least bit of it back; would you take it wrongfully without a right and (with) a manifest sin) The Ayah commands: When one of you wants to divorce a wife and marry another one, he must not take any portion of the dowry he gave to the first wife, even if it were a Qintar of money. We mentioned the meaning of Qintar in the Tafsir of Surah Al `Imran. This Ayah is clear in its indication that the dowry could be substantial. `Umar bin Al-Khattab used to discourage giving a large dowry, but later on changed his view. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Al-`Ajfa' As-Sulami said that he heard `Umar bin Al-Khattab saying, ""Do not exaggerate with the dowry of women, had this practice been an honor in this world or a part of Taqwa, then the Prophet would have had more right to practice it than you. The Messenger of Allah never gave any of his wives, nor did any of his daughters receive a dowry more than twelve Uwqiyah. A man used to pay a substantial dowry and thus conceal enmity towards his wife!''. Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la recorded that Masruq said, ""`Umar bin Al-Khattab stood up on the Minbar of the Messenger of Allah and said, `O people! Why do you exaggerate concerning the dowry given to women The Messenger of Allah and his Companions used to pay up to four hundred Dirhams for a dowry, or less than that. Had paying more for a dowry been a part of Taqwa or an honor, you would not have led them in this practice. Therefore, I do not want to hear about a man who pays more than four hundred Dirhams for a dowry.' He then went down the Minbar, but a woman from Quraysh said to him, `O Leader of the Faithful! You prohibited people from paying more than four hundred Dirhams in a dowry for women' He said, `Yes.' She said, `Have you not heard what Allah sent down in the Qur'an' He said, `Which part of it' She said, `Have you not heard Allah's statement."	0
595	And wish not for the things in which Allah has made some of you to excel others. For men there is reward for what they have earned, (and likewise) for women there is reward for what they have earned, and ask Allah of His Bounty. Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knower of everything.	0
596	God revealed what means, [Men shall have a portion of what the parents and the near relatives leave, and women shall have a portion of what the parents and the near relatives leave, whether there is little or much of it; a stated portion.] (An-NisaaÂ 4:7) The Islamic law of inheritance is extremely detailed, but its most salient features are that: a. The extent of the share of inheritance is dependent on the heirÂs relationship to the deceased. b. In most cases, the maleÂs share of the inheritance is twice that of the femaleÂs. This is due to the variant financial responsibilities of the male and the female in Islam. It is clear that men need the extra share of inheritance in view of the commitments they have, not only to their own families, but also to other poor relatives who may be dependent on them. c. The shares to be allotted out of any inheritance are determined by Allah and not by any human being.	0
597	"The Quran mastered the process of brainwashing, having learned from earlier faiths and Arabian pagans faith. Three things are central to their brainwashing: making you feel special, repeation, and reward system that makes you feel you are there but never really there. 1.Like many cults, feeling special or selected few helps build a special bond that makes you feel almost god-like even when you are asked to pray like a slave. It is a feeling that even slaves working for their masters felt when they accomplished their tasks. 2. The contents of the Quran and Hadith are filled with repeated content part of the brainwashing process. But more disturbing is that it regularly suggest that ""you"" were a witness to things that you could not possibly have been there. For example, ""did you not see what we did to the elephant people?"" Quran 105:1. Did you? Or ""did you not see that Allah created the heavens and Earth..?""Quran 14:19. Part of the brainwashing process of the Quran, is to keep repeating statements insisting that YOU are a witness to something you did not see. If you keep repeating the same lie again and again, eventual you will start believing it. There is a criminal term for this. It is called ""coercive behaviour"". The Quran is scattered with these statements!! 3. Reward system, a system that suggest you are being rewarded now and later. When good things happen, you attribute it to Skydaddy with questioning and when bad things happen you forget about it. And constantly day dreaming of brothel-Jannah means you are injecting your brain with happy hormones that you become addicted to it. And just like that, we get brainwashed! So desperate to maintain this faith, we become good at, turning undeniable nonsense, reinventing it again and again to make it sound like it makes sense! Like the many claims that the science confirms the Quran, and rationalising the many immoral commands in the Quran and Hadith! Once you open your eyes, you simply cannot go back to this place and you start seeing them for what they are...a cult!"	1

Today we are going to talk about the hygiene of the prophet and how Muhammad did some really disgusting things to be an example to anyone when it comes to personal hygiene. Please be advised that what will be posted may be nauseating to others but it has to be done to expose this man who leads so many astray to this day.	1
602	THE QURÂAN AND HADITH CONFIRM MUHAMMAD IS IN HELL & ALL MUSLIMS ARE GOING TO HELL. The shocking truth most Muslims don't know. Islam stands and falls on the person of Muhammad. The entire structure of Islam is built upon the belief that Muhammad was GodÂs greatest prophet. As such, Muslims will naturally expect Allah to resurrect him to a heavenly Paradise immediately upon his death. However, it may come as a shock for them to learn that according to the most authentic Hadith in the Muslim world and substantiated by a verse in the QurÂan, their beloved Prophet is in Hell. Yes! AllahÂs perfect QurÂan clearly states that Muhammad is in Hell along with his pious followers who have passed away in death. Even more troubling for Muslims today is the fact that the very same destiny awaits them. Unbelievable? We will now consider the evidences from both the QurÂan and from authentic Islamic sources to substantiate our case. The vast majority of the Muslims are ignorant of their religion. Many who read this account may find it shocking. Shocking as it may be, it is nonetheless based on the true teachings of Islam. There is no doubt in the meaning of this Hadith. According to the clear teaching of this Hadith, Muhammad descended straight into Hell following his death. He did not ascend to any heavenly Paradise as Muslims claim. At this very moment, Muhammad is in Hell waiting to be rescued by Allah. And the account continues on to state that a ÂbridgeÂ (As-Sirat) will be Âlaid across HellÂ for the pious to escape from there on the ÂDay of Judgment.Â And the Hadith clearly states that Muhammad will be amongst Âthe first to cross itÂ with his followers. Since the ÂbridgeÂ is Âlaid across Hell,Â Muhammad has to be in Hell in order to exit from that fiery place through that Âbridge.Â	1
603	Religion is supposed to make bad people good. But Islam makes good people bad.	1
604	There is no legal provision in either the QurÂan or the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, which prohibits women from seeking a career or a job. Indeed in the ideal Islamic society, it is desirable that women are treated and nursed by women, and that female children are educated by women teachers at primary and advanced levels. Women are entitled to equal rates of pay with men doing similar work. In Islamic law, however, the most significant role for a woman is that of motherhood and household management; if there is a conflict between this and a career, Islam says motherhood should take precedence because of its importance to society. The biggest problems in contemporary society result from looking down on the role of the mother, yet no one is as productive as she is: A husband would become bankrupt very quickly if he had to pay her for all the work she does; sometimes she is Âon callÂ 24 hours a day! There is no greater fulfillment than a happy home with healthy and well-brought up children.	0
605	When the Prophet Muhammad stood in the Farewell Pilgrimage, he announced in his immortal speech, this divine balance of justice, and said: ÂO people, your Lord is one, and your father is one, is there no preference for an Arab over a non-Arab, nor for a non-Arab over an Arab, nor for a red over a black, Nor for black over red except with piety	0
606	The QurÂan emphasizes the essential unity of men and women in a most beautiful metaphor: ÂThey (Your wives) are your garments and ye are their garments. Â. Surah 2 Verse 187 Just as a garment hides our nakedness, so do husband and wife, by entering into the relationship of marriage, secure each otherÂs chastity. The garment gives comfort to the body; so does the husband find comfort in his wifeÂs company and she in his. Actually a garment is the grace, the beauty, the embellishment of the body, so too are wives to their husbands as their husbands are to them. Islam does not consider woman Âan instrument of the devilÂ, but rather the QurÂan calls her muhsana, a fortress against Satan. This is because a good woman, by marrying a man, helps him keep to the path of rectitude in his life. It is for this reason that Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) considered marriage as a most virtuous act. The QurÂan has given the raison dÂetre of marriage in the following words: ÂAnd among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquility with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts): verily in that are Signs for those who reflectÂ. Surah 30 Verse 21 Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) always praised virtuous and chaste women. He said: ÂThe world and all things in the world are precious, but the most precious thing in the world is a virtuous woman.Â He (pbuh) was also most emphatic in enjoining upon Muslims, to be kind to their women, when he delivered his famous sermon, khutbat al-wadaÂ on the Mount of Mercy, at Arafat. This was in the presence of one hundred and twenty-four thousand of his Companions. who had gathered there forhajjat al-wadaÂ (farewell pilgrimage). It was in this famous Farewell Sermon that he ordered Muslim men to be respectful and kind towards women. He said: ÂFear God regarding women. Verily you have married them with the trust of God, and made their bodies lawful with the word of God. You have got (rights) over them, and they have got (rights) over you ÂÂ	0
607	And We have sent you (O Muhammad ) not but as a mercy for the ÂAlamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists	0
608	As is the case of the Prophet - may GodÂs prayers and peace be upon him - with all people; easy, gentle, humble and generous, with those who knew him and did not know him; So how is he with the enemies of Islam who hope - may GodÂs prayers and peace be upon him - their Islam?	0
609	It is one thing to execute murderers but to torture them excessively as Muhammad did is contrary to the laws of human justice. Can someone claiming to be a messenger of God display such excessive cruelty? He actually pierced their eyes with heated nails and had both their hands and feet cut off. The bodies were then thrown on stony ground to die slowly of dehydration. The dying menÂs plea for water was refused. Even a prisoner on death-row is given a decent meal before he is executed. Such actions as barbaric as these will shock any decent human with a minute sense of justice but not the followers of Islam. They will defend the actions of this extremely cruel man no matter how barbaric it may be. This is the legacy of Islam. Islam gave mankind one of the cruelest laws as a punishment for those who do not conform to its barbaric teachings. And Islam was founded by an equally cruel prophet to match this cruelty. The above list describing MuhammadÂs criminal behavior is provided by the most authentic Islamic sources. They are based on eyewitness accounts of the most devout Muslims who are defenders of the Islamic faith. These are the testimonies of the Companions of Muhammad who lived with him. They have no reason, whatsoever, to fabricate these stories. In fact, they viewed MuhammadÂs conduct as divinely designed. Even after his death, they emulated him and continued in the same wicked course. Their devotion to him was so absolute that could not even perceive the wickedness he committed in the name of Allah. Even so, the above list is not complete. They are too many to decipher. Time and space will not permit us to detail all his sins and atrocities of Muhammad. For instance, Muhammad was also a Rapist, a Warmonger, a Wife-beater, a Slave-owner, an Animal hater, an Idolater, a Polygamist who even exceeded the Islamic limits. And the list goes on. Can we expect such behavior from a man claiming to be a prophet of God? A true prophet will not act the way as Muhammad did. He will not force his faith on the people but will win them over by his virtue. He will not wage war on others to spread his message. He will not command armies. He will not kill. Yet, Muhammad committed all these evil deeds in the name of Allah. Will the true God encourage his worshippers to emulate such ungodly behavior? Yet, Allah does. What does this reveal to us about Allah?	1
610	Muslims are right in saying Allah cannot become a man or take form of a man, that's because he's already a man or a creature with body parts, as acknowledged by the authentic sources of Islam. Allah says he can produce sons with the sex houris of paradise Q 21:17, he prays to other gods like Muslims Q 33:56. Islam is polytheism. He's not like the true all powerful God.	1
611	QURAN THE SOURCE OF TERRORISM, Islam is not a religion of peace at all; the perpetrators of terrorism are following the edicts clearly given in the Surahs (verses) that constitute the Quran, their holy book. The word Islam means submission. The Quran dictates repeatedly that its followers must convert you to Islam or kill you if you refuse to convert. Much of the Quran speaks not about religion but only about how one must submit; it commands how one must live, dress, treat women and slaves, and practice jihad. The Quran is replete with Surahs directing its followers to violence.	1

614	Numerous verses of the QurÂan state that men and women are equal in the site of Allah; the only thing that distinguishes people in His site is their level of God-consciousness. Islam teaches that a woman is a full person under the law, and is the spiritual equal of a male. Women have the right to own property, to operate a business, and to receive equal pay for equal work. Women are allowed total control of their wealth. They cannot be married against their will, and they are allowed to keep their own name when married. They have the right to inherit property and to have their marriage dissolved in the case of neglect or mistreatment. Islam does not consider woman an Âevil temptress,Â and thus does not blame woman for Original Sin (a doctrine that Islam rejects). Women in Islam participate in all forms of worship that men participate in. Prophet MuhammadÂs mission stopped many of the horrible practices against women that were present in the society of his time. He actually harnessed the unrestricted polygamy of the Arabs of the time, and put many laws in place to protect the well-being of women. In his Farewell Sermon just weeks before his death, he summarized the teachings of Islam to the believers in a final farewell. His last words were ÂBe kind to women!Â	0

Then Allah mentioned the parable, saying, (the wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut. They were under two of our righteous servants,) means, they were the wives of two of Allah's Messengers and were their companions by day and night, eating with them and sleeping with them, as much as any marriage contains of interaction between spouses. However, (they both betrayed them.) meaning, in the faith, they did not adhere to the faith sent through their husbands nor accepted their message. Therefore, all the intimate knowledge of their husbands neither helped them nor prevented punishment, hence Allah's statement, (So, they availed them not against Allah) means, because their wives were disbelievers, (and it was said) meaning, to these wives, (Enter the Fire along with those who enter!) The part of the Ayah that reads?	0
619	Being Kind to the Divorced Wife. This is a command from Allah to men that when one of them divorces his wife with a reversible divorce, he should treat her kindly. So when her term of `Iddah (waiting period) nears its end, he either takes her back in a way that is better, including having witnesses that he has taken her back, and he lives with her with kindness. Or, he should release her after her `Iddah finishes and then kindly asks her to depart from his house, without disputing, fighting with her or using foul words.	0
620	Zaynab was married to Zaid, Muhammad's adopted son. One day Muhammad paid a visit to Zaid's house. Not expecting Muhammad, , Zaynab answered the door dressed in a revealing garment, and Muhammad immediately developed a desire for her. When Zaid learned of the prophet's infatuation, he divorced Zaynab so Muhammad could marry her. This turned into a scandal among the Arabs, who equated Muhammad's actions with incest, since he married his daughter-in-law. 	1
621	"This is a promise from Allah to those Children of Adam, male or female, who do righteous deeds - deeds in accordance with the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet , with a heart that believes in Allah and His Messenger , while believing that these deeds are commanded and enjoined by Allah. Allah promises that He will give them a good life in this world and that He will reward them according to the best of their deeds in the Hereafter. The good life includes feeling tranquillity in all aspects of life. It has been reported that Ibn `Abbas and a group (of scholars) interpreted it to mean good, lawful provisions. It was reported that `Ali bin Abi Talib interpreted as contentment. `Ali bin Abi Talhah recorded from Ibn `Abbas that it meant happiness. Al-Hasan, Mujahid and Qatadah said: ""None gets ?this? good life ?mentioned? except in Paradise.'' Ad-Dahhak said: ""It means lawful provisions and worship in this life''. Ad-Dahhak also said: ""It means working to obey Allah and finding joy in that.'' The correct view is that a good life includes all of these things."	0

624	"(The Zaniyah and the Zani, flog each of them with a hundred stripes.) This honorable Ayah contains the ruling on the law of retaliation for the person who commits illegal sex, and details of the punishment. Such a person will either be unmarried, meaning that he has never been married, or he will be married, meaning that he has had intercourse within the bounds of a lawful marriage, and he is free, adult and of sound mind. As for the virgin who is unwedded, the prescribed punishment is one hundred stripes, as stated in this Ayah. In addition to this he is to be banished from his homeland for one year, in the Hadith about the two bedouins who came to the Messenger of Allah . One of them said, ""O Messenger of Allah, this son of mine was employed by this man, and committed Zina with his wife. I paid a ransom with him on behalf of my son one hundred sheep and a slave-girl, but when I asked the people of knowledge, they said that my son should be given one hundred stripes and banished for a year, and that this man's wife should be stoned to death. (Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allah,) Meaning, with a ruling prescribed by Allah. So the meaning of the Ayah is: ""Do not feel too sorry for them where the laws of Allah are established.'' This does not mean that we should not naturally feel pity when carrying out the punishment. What is prohibited here is the kind of pity that may make the judge ignore the punishment altogether. This is what is not permitted for the judge. (if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. ) means, then do that, carry out the punishments on those who commit illegal sex, and strike them hard without causing any wound, so that he and others like him will be deterred by the terror of that. In Al-Musnad, it was recorded that one of the Companions said, ""O Messenger of Allah, when I slaughter a sheep I feel pity for it. (And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.)

At the same time, not a single copy or fragment of either the Torah or Gospel from any era has ever been found which deviates in a way that agrees with the Quran. How is that the ""true"" Bible - the one that supposedly confirms the Quran - never survived in any form, while so many ""corrupted"" copies did? Isn't it more likely that Muhammad simply made it up as he went along and later accused Christians and Jews as a cover story for his own mistakes?"	1

629	Islam is corrupt. The Quran [Hadith and Sirath] gives plenty of testimony to it being a fabricated faith, created out of theft and loot, and out of greed and desire to conquer, occupy and destroy other nations and cultures. Islam is religion gone in reverse. It had no authentic leadership or prophet. It was an imaginary invention by a barbaric, illiterate crude and cruel criminal who was greedy for an empire. It was collected from booty, compiled out of bits and pieces from other faiths [360 religious customs and tribal faiths existing in the region], which the self-invented prophet of Islam gathered during his raids and genocide of innocent people.	1
630	"Muslims often complain of ""misconceptions"" about their religion, yet few seem to know all that much about the true history of Islam and its founder, Muhammad.  As a result, the biggest misconceptions about Islam are often those propagated by Muslims themselves. Here, we refute the contemporary mythology of Muhammad by referring to the earliest and most reliable Muslim historians, who based their writings on those who actually knew their revered prophet. The Hadith (traditions), Sira (biography of Muhammad) and the Quran provide the true Islamic counterpart to the Christian Bible and Jewish Torah.  The Quran is simply the purported words of Allah arranged in no particular order.  It makes little sense outside of the context provided by the other two sources."	1

Do not just pick the SUGAR COATED lessons from Quran that fit your personal need that made you fake Muslims.

Shall I give 2/3 of my property in charity? He said, No. I said, 'Then 1/2 of it? He said, 'Even 1/3 is too much, for, to leave your inheritors wealthy is better than to leave them in poverty, begging from people.

637	A quick summary of the events on the Islamic: judgement day. Allah will burn all muslims in hell, then he will save those who might have been pious to him from inside hell, all burnt out and only the prayer marks on their faces will remain when they are being saved, leaving the rest on their knees in hell. The only way to go straight in to Islamic paradise without being burnt in hell first is to die while killing or trying to kill someone for Allah, and the murderers are entitled to a mansion, 72 virgins, rivers of alcohol, milk and honey. It's not important whether you are naked or not, circumcised or not, bare footed or not, if you didn't die in a fight, you go to hell first and you'll be either saved from inside hell or left there on your knees, depending on your deeds. And most of the dwellers of hell are women. Muhammad promised the 7th century desert Arabs lots of nonsense simply to lure them in to fighting for him. Any rich man can have better than Allah's paradise right here in this life. So, who is Allah?	1

Makes no sense and has no historical context or evidence. Nothing...it appears to be a pagan folklore story (myth) that made it into the Quran. Killing dogs is yet another irrational fear where Muhammad liked cats and disliked dogs...Allah who created everything, suddenly (never mentioned any issues with dogs in past messages) decides they are bad. You can see the hesitation here, a human hesitation, where the killing of dogs is strongly in the hadith but not really mentioned in the Quran. And why ""black dogs""? Again...no rational reason. You can read this another crazy issues Islam have with many animals here...the one thing they all have in common: Muhammad dislike them."	1
641	Abu Huraira told that when GodÂs Messenger was asked which woman was best he replied, ÂThe one who pleases [her husband] when he looks at her, obeys him when he gives a command, and does not go against his wishes regarding her person or property by doing anything of which he disapproves.	0
642	In fact, taking Islamic law as a whole, women are much more favored financially than their male counterparts for the following reasons:     During the period of engagement prior to marriage, any gifts given by the womanÂs fiancÃ© are her own.     On marriage, she is entitled to receive a marriage gift, dowry, (which usually takes the form of money) and this is her own property.     If the woman has any property prior to her marriage, this property continues to be at her sole disposal after the marriage; her husband has no claims on it.     Even if the wife is rich, she is not required to spend a single penny on the household; the full responsibility for her food, clothing, housing, medication, recreation, etc. is her husbandÂs.     Any income the wife earns through investing or working is entirely hers, to be spent as she alone wishes.     In case of divorce, if there is any deferred part of the dowry still to be paid, it becomes due immediately.     The divorced woman is entitled to full maintenance during the waiting period which follows divorce, and is also entitled to maintenance for her children.	0

644	There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower	0
645	"Umar expelled the Jews and the Christians from Hijaz. When Allah's Apostle (SAW) had conquered Khaibar, he wanted to expel the Jews from it as its land became the property of Allah, His Apostle (SAW), and the Muslims. Allah's Apostle (SAW) intended to expel the Jews but they requested him to let them stay there on the condition that they would do the labour and get half of the fruits. Allah's Apostle (SAW) told them, ""We will let you stay on thus condition, as long as we wish."" So, they (i.e. Jews) kept on living there until Umar forced them to go towards Taima and Ariha."	0
646	"Yes...if this was any other religion, we would be THE FIRST to mock it ..but because it is from ours...we should say ""Subhan Allah"" ""Take for example the case where a companion of the Prophet drinks his blessed urine, only to discover that she has now been shielded completely from the fire of Hell!"" Yes....if this was any other religion, we would be THE FIRST to mock it ..but because it is from ours...we should say ""Subhan Allah"" Here is the source that shows this incident is mentioned in multiple authentic hadith: Yes...if this was any other religion, we would be THE FIRST to mock it ..but because it is from ours...we should say ""Subhan Allah"	1
647	The QurÂan never addresses the Jews and Christians without saying, ÂO People of the BookÂ or ÂO You who have been given the Book,Â indicating that they were originally people of a revealed religion. For this reason, there exists a relationship of mercy and spiritual kinship between them and Muslims, all having in common the principles of the one true religion sent by Allah through His Prophets (peace and blessings are upon them all). In the QurÂan, Allah says: Â(He has ordained for (the Muslims) the same religion which He enjoined on Noah, and that which We have revealed to thee (Muhammad) and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: that you should establish the faith and make no division in it.Â (Ash-Shura 42:13).	0
648	Abdullah bin Abu Awfa said: When Muadh bin Jabal came from Sham, he prostrated to the Prophet who said: 'What is this, O Muadh? He said: I went to Sham and saw them prostrating to their bishops and patricians and I wanted to do that for you. The messenger of Allah said: Do not do that. If I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone other than Allah, I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad! No woman can fulfill her duty towards Allah until she fulfills her duty towards her husband. If he asks her (for intimacy) even if she is on her camel saddle, she should not refuse.	0
649	The Prophet Muhammed offered a two-rak`at prayer on `Id day and he did not offer any (Nawafil prayer) before or after it. He then went towards the women, and Bilal was accompanying him, and ordered them to give alms. And so the women started giving their earrings (etc .).	0
650	"(And give to the women (whom you marry) their Saduqat Nihlah) refers to the dowry. `A'ishah said that `Nihlah' means `obligatory'. Muqatil said, `Nihlah' means `obligatory' Ibn Jurayj added: `specified.' Ibn Zayd said, ""In Arabic, Nihlah, refers to what is necessary. So Allah is commanding: Do not marry unless you give your wife something that is her right. No person after the Prophet is allowed to marry a woman except with the required dowry, nor by giving false promises about the dowry (intended). Therefore, the man is required to pay a dowry to his wife with a good heart, just as he gives a gift with a good heart. If the wife gives him part or all of that dowry with a good heart, her husband is allowed to take it, as it is lawful for him in this case. This is why Allah said afterwards, (But if they, of their own pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm.)"	0
651	Everytime we speak to Muslims we get stupified by how ignorant and manipulated they are by their so called teachers imams and sheikhs. We have come across Muslims that have this idea that YAHWEH who is the TRUE GOD and the GOD OF ISRAEL AND ALL NATIONS is a pagan god. The problem is... When we look at the Quran we get to read about two characters who are 'prophets of allah' named ZACHARIYAH and YAHYA. when we analyze these two names we get to find that ZACHARIYAH is a Hebrew name that mean YAHWEH REMEMBERS and YAHYA is also a Hebrew name that means YAHWEH is GRACIOUS So the questions to my Muslim brothers and sisters are... 1. Why are TWO of your prophets named after A PAGAN GOD?? 2. Why is Allah giving two of his prophets names after another god apart from him?	1
652	(Those who take an oath not to have sexual relations with their wives) meaning, swear not to have sexual relations with the wife. This Ayah indicates that the Ila' involves the wife and not a slave-women, as the majority of the scholars have agreed, (...must wait for four months,) meaning, the husband waits for four months from the time of the vow and then ends the Ila' (if the vow was for four or more months) and is required to either return to his wife or divorce her. This is why Allah said next: (...verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) with any shortcomings that occurred in the rights of the wife because of the vow of Ila'.	0
653	Is Islam imperialistic? Are there verses in the QurÂan stating that Islam is the religion of truth, and therefore it must prevail over all other religions? (9:33, 48:28 and 61:9) Answer: True Islam, practiced according to its original sources, the QurÂan and Sunnah, is not imperialistic at all. Some Muslim rulers throughout history may have deviated from its teachings in some degree or the other. Their actions, however, are not to be equated with normative Islam. Some jurists even gave opinions that seemed to have justified these actions. Such interpretations may have been influenced by the kind of world in which they lived, which is vastly different from ours today. None of these scholars claimed infallibility or finality of their interpretations. Yet, whether such interpretations were valid for their times and specific circumstances or whether they were contrary to the overall text and spirit of Islam, the fact remains that interpretation of the primary sources of Islam is an endeavor which is not frozen in time. Historically, those who espoused such arguments may have erred in understanding some parts of the QurÂan. They may have failed to understand how those parts fit into the total picture of the teachings of the QurÂan teachings on the relationship between Muslims and others. History bears testimony that Islam spread much faster during the periods of peace, not war. Even in periods when Muslims did not ÂprevailÂ economically, socially, militarily, or politically, Islam continued to spread. The same phenomenon can be seen in our time, which is a time of great suffering and persecution of Muslims in many parts of the world. Even some of those who attacked Islam and Muslims and committed horrible massacres of Muslims, such as the Mongols and the Crusaders, ultimately accepted Islam themselves. It is rather interesting to see the conqueror accepting the faith of the conquered rather than the reverse. Clear historical and geographical facts show that Islam has spread more by peaceful means than by force. A look at the map of the Muslim world today shows that the bulk of Muslims live in countries where there was no fighting, not even defensive fighting. An example is Indonesia, with nearly 200 million Muslims. Thomas Arnold, a former Christian missionary in India, in his famous book Preaching of Islam, indicated that while there have been certain periods where Muslim rulers have diverted from this tolerance, it was the fault of the rulers and not attributed to Islamic teachings. He concludes that the two primary reasons for the spread of Islam all over the world were the merchants and the Sufis (mystics), two groups of people who went out, worked with humanity, and gently invited others to the path of Allah. If it were true that Islam allows use of force to convert people, then how did religious minorities thrive in regions under Muslim rule? It is also worth asking why did the QurÂan and Sunnah explicitly dictate regulations and rights for the protection of non-Muslim minorities living under the rule of Islam, if other religions are to be eliminated so that Islam may Âprevail.Â The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) even said that if a Muslim hurts a dhimmi or covenanted person (a non-Muslim living under the rule of Islam) or commits any injustice to him, then on the Day of Judgment, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) will be the advocate on behalf of the non-Muslim against the Muslim. What is the sense of these prescriptions and advice if those people had to accept Islam or be killed? Why does the QurÂan repeatedly speak about peaceful dialogue with non-Muslims (Al-`Ankabut 29:46) if they have to be killed in the first place? If indeed Islam insists on the use of force for conversion, then why did people, when no longer under Muslim rule, not revert back to their previous faiths? It is true that three verses in the QurÂan (At-Tawbah 9:33, Al-Fath 48:28, and As-Saff 61:9) state that Allah sent forth His Messenger (Muhammad) with the message of guidance and the religion of truth, so that it may ÂprevailÂ over all religions. What does prevail mean in this context? Must we limit our understanding of the word prevail to the narrow context of military or political power? There have been many tyrannical empires throughout history that prevailed economically, politically, or militarily at one time or another. Their dominance was impermanent. This is a very superficial and temporary type of prevailing. Real prevailing is the prevailing of the truth and belief in the One True God and all that that implies. In fact, a better translation of the original QurÂanic Arabic term li-yuzhirahu is Âto proclaim it,Â rather than Âto make it prevail.Â This was the translation adopted by Abullah Yusuf Ali.	0
654	Ramadan, Islam's holiest month, was a non-Muslim pagan Arab festival. In fact almost every important ritual in Islam was stolen from pre islamic pagans. The Month of Ramadan, The 5 daily prayers , The pilgrimage to Kaaba, The running between safa and marwa hills. The difference between pre-Islamic Ramadan and Islamic Ramadan is that pre-Islamic Ramadan was practiced by pagan tribes in Arabia and Islamic Ramadan is practiced by Muslims all over the world. During Ramadan pagan Arabs used to abstain from food, water, sexual contact etc, from dawn to dusk. Muslims practice the same pagan rituals during Ramadan. It is a well-known fact that Islam adapted this pagan practice of fasting. There is a Hadith in Sahih Bukhari that mentions the ritual.	1
655	It is permissible for a Muslim to be kind to a peaceful person of the People of the Book, whether by being soft in speech, or by helping, or by treating them with justice and fairness and fulfilling their rights, and other things.	0
656	As a matter of fact, before the advent of Islam, women were often treated worse than animals! Pagan Arabs used to bury their female children alive, make women dance naked in the vicinity of the KaÂba during their annual fairs, and treat women as mere chattels and objects of sexual pleasure Â possessing no rights or position whatsoever, these teachings of the Noble QurÂan were revolutionary. Unlike other religions, which regarded women as being possessed of inherent sin and wickedness, and men as being possessed of inherent virtue and nobility, Islam regards men and women as being of the same essence created from a single soul. ÂO mankind! revere your Guardian-Lord, who created you from a single soul, created, of like nature, its mate, and from the two, scattered (like seeds) countless men and women;- revere God, through whom ye demand your mutual (rights), and (revere) the wombs (That bore you): for God ever watches over youÂ. Surah 4 Verse 1.	0
657	Hijacking pagan practices and rebranding it for Islam was Muhammad's specialty.  All he needed to do was to associate the practice with the Jews or their prophets. The pagan rituals of running between marwa and safa, kissing of the black stone circumambulating the Ka'aba were all done by the pagan Arabs before the advent of Islam. When Muhammad conquered mecca, he not only hijacked their city, but also their ritual practices. The companions of Muhammad serves as eye witnesses and admitted the truth of the practices originating from the pagan Arabs.	1
658	Kaaba, a name originating from the Tamil language? The word Kabaa may originate from Tamil and the word Kabaalishwaran . Tamil is considered one of the oldest languages of the world. DravidianÂs worshiped Lord Shiva as their Primal Deity Â from the Indus valley civilization. Shiva TempleÂs in South India are called as Kabaalishwaran templeÂs. Kabaali, therefore Â refer to Lord Shiva. There are many other words in Islam that appear to be connected to Hinduism. For example, in Sanskrit Allah, Akka and Amba are synonyms. They signify a goddess or mother. 	1

660	(Verily, the Muslims: men and women, the believers: men and women...) indicates that Iman is something other than Islam, and that it is more specific, (the Qanit: men and the women,) Al-Qunut means obedience during quite time.(the men and women who are truthful,) This refers to their speech, for truthfulness is a praiseworthy attribute. Some of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, were never known to have lied even once, neither during Jahiliyyah nor in Islam. Truthfulness is a sign of faith, just as lying is a sign of hypocrisy. (the men and the women who are patient,) This is the attribute of those who are steadfast, which is patience in the face of adversity and knowing that what is decreed will inevitably come to pass. So, they face it with patience and steadfastness. Patience is the most difficult when disaster first strikes, then after that it becomes easier, and this is true steadfastness. (the Khashi`: men and the women,) Khushu` means serenity and tranquillity, deliberation and dignity and humility. What motivates a person to be like this is the fear of Allah and the awareness that He is constantly watching. (the men and the women who give Sadaqat,) As-Sadaqah (charity) means doing good to people who are in need or who are weak and have no means of earning a living and none to financially support them. They give them from the excess of their wealth in obedience to Allah and as a good deed to His creation. (the men and the women who fast,)'' Fasting is also one of the greatest means of overcoming one's desires, (the men and the women who guard their chastity) i.e., they protect their private parts from forbidden and sinful things, except for that which is permitted, (and the men and the women who remember Allah much). (Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward.) Here Allah tells us that for all of those mentioned in this Ayah, He has prepared for them forgiveness of their sins and a great reward, meaning, Paradise.	0

664	Rejection of belief in God will surely have consequences in the afterlife. However, it is up to God to determine these consequences. Such future determination has no bearing on the respect of the humanity of every person in this life. After all, the human is a free agent, and as such, each is individually responsible before God for his or her beliefs and moral choices. A person can be held accountable in this life only if such a moral choice infringes on the rights of individuals or society, such as the commission of crimes or acts of aggression. In other words, no human is entitled to dehumanize or punish another on the sole ground that the later is following a different religion or no religion at all. This value implies that peaceful co-existence among followers of all religions and respecting their humanity is not only possible, but also mandated in the QurÂan.	0
665	Not even one with the brains of a gnat would believe that a Muslim imam engaged in inviting non-Muslims to Islam would undermine his cause by making an open declaration that the Muslim mission in life is to kill all non-Muslims. Or else he must be insane or hopelessly dim-witted. And lastly, if Allah had commanded Muslims to kill all non-Muslims, the Prophet and his companions would not have left alive any non-Muslim tribes in Arabia, when they had got complete authority over them. Speaking of the Christian missionary claim that Islam was spread at the point of the sword, one may ask: Was it because of the fear of the sword that hundreds of thousands of the most warlike Arabs of the time literally followed the Prophet in everything he commanded?	0

669	You will never be able to do perfect justice between wives even if it is your ardent desire, so do not incline too much to one of them (by giving her more of your time and provision) so as to leave the other hanging (i.e. neither divorced nor married). And if you do justice, and do all that is right and fear Allah by keeping away from all that is wrong, then Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.	0
670	(Except from their wives or their right hand possessions) meaning, from their female slaves.	0
671	Divorce before consummating the Marriage: Allah allowed divorce after the marriage contract and before consummating the marriage. Ibn `Abbas said that `touched' (mentioned in the Ayah) means sexual intercourse. The husband is allowed to divorce his wife before consummating the marriage or giving the dowry if it was deferred. The Mut`ah (Gift) at the time of Divorce: Allah commands the husband to give the wife (whom he divorces before consummating the marriage) a gift of a reasonable amount, the rich according to his means and the poor according to his means, to compensate her for her loss. Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih that Allah's Messenger married Umaymah bint Sharahil. When she was brought to the Prophet he extended his hand to her, but she did not like that. The Prophet then ordered Abu Usayd to provide provisions for her along with a gift of two garments.	0
672	What is clear, historically, about Prophet MuhammadÂs dealings with the Jewish tribes in and around Madinah is that as soon as he migrated to Madinah, he established the constitution of Madinah or sahifa. As Dr. Hamidullah described it, it was the first multicultural, multi-religious constitution in the world. It gave everyone equal rights, including the Jews. It conferred legal autonomy and the right to practice oneÂs own religion freely, and it required a commitment to defend the city of Madinah against external aggression. None can accuse the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) of breaking this agreement. Even non-Muslim scholars such as Montgomery Watts never mention that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) betrayed his agreements. In fact, other parties committed acts that were contrary to the agreements on more than one occasion. Whatever penalty was applied, however, it was only applied to the specific group of people who committed the offense, not to all. If it was applied to all, one might suspect group bias, such as anti-Semitism, but it was only to the offending tribe. Furthermore, the punishment was always proportionate to the offense that was committed. Uncovering a Muslim woman was different from conspiring to kill the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and such actions were handled in different ways. The ultimate betrayal occurred during the Battle of the Trench, when a group of Jews from Madinah contacted the enemy, unilaterally renounced the constitution of Madinah, and helped the enemy during war against the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and Madinah. In modern times, this is referred to as high treason at the time of war. Referring to this incident, many say the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) massacred the tribe of Banu Quraizhah, but this is a distortion of the historical facts. In fact, it was not a sentence by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). The people of Banu Quraizhah chose their own arbitrator and former ally (Sa`d), who determined their punishment according to the law of the Torah, which specifies killing for treason. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) simply agreed with his sentence, but it was not the sentence of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in the first place. A scholarly article by W. N. Arafat questions the exaggerated estimate of the number of fighting men who were punished, which is found even in some biographies about the ProphetÂs life, like that of Ibn Ishaq. His argument is compelling and well researched. The main question is whether 5:85 speaks of all Jews and at all times or to those who were hostile to Muslims and betrayed them contrary to their treaty. Given both the textual and historical contexts, it refers only to those who adopted an attitude or initiated enmity, if not outright aggression, against Muslims, not to a whole religious group.	0
673	Ibn 'Abbas reported that the Messenger of Allah went out on the day of Adha or Fitr and observed two rak'ahs, and did not observe prayer (at that place) before and after that. He then came to the women along with Bilal and commanded them to give alms and the women began to give their rings and necklaces.	0

He was asked about a person who remembered that he had a sexual dream but did not find moisture. He replied: Bath is not necessary for him. Umm Salamah then asked: Is washing necessary for a woman if she sees that (in her dream)? He replied: Yes. Woman are counterpart of men.	0
677	"(You will never be able to do perfect justice between wives even if it is your ardent desire,) means, O people! You will never be able to be perfectly just between wives in every respect. Even when one divides the nights justly between wives, there will still be various degrees concerning love, desire and sexual intimacy, Imam Ahmad and the collectors of the Sunan recorded that `A'ishah said, ""The Messenger of Allah used to treat his wives equally and proclaim, (so do not incline too much to one of them) means, when you like one of your wives more than others, do not exaggerate in treating her that way, so as to leave the other hanging. ) referring to the other wives. Ibn `Abbas said that Mu`allaqah (hanging) means, ""She is neither divorced nor married.'' (And if you do justice, and do all that is right and have Taqwa, then Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) The Ayah states: If you do justice and divide equally in what you have power over, while fearing Allah in all conditions, then Allah will forgive you the favoritism that you showed to some of your wives"	0

I have two daughters whose father died, and they do not own anything. "	0

685	Is Islam a religion of the true God or is it of the Devil? Knowing the answer to this question makes the difference between eternal salvation and eternal ruination. And more than a billion lives are at stake. To determine the true source behind the origin of Islam. We must study how Islam came into existence. Islam began with the person of Muhammad. It began with the revelations Muhammad received from Allah. Therefore, it is absolutely important to begin our evaluation of Islam by investigating the calling of Muhammad as a Prophet of Allah. Muhammad received his calling in the darkness of a cave. His immediate conclusion was that the spirit which delivered the very first verses of the QurÂan was an evil force. He concluded that the spirit which spoke to him in the cave was a demon. After this terrifying and violent encounter with the spirit, Muhammad believed he was possessed by a demon. MuhammadÂs reaction was one of terror. And he fled the cave. 	1

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Malik Al-Ghifari said that Ibn `Abbas said that when this Ayah was revealed, (And do not marry idolatresses till they believe,) the people did not marry the pagan women. When the following Ayah was revealed, ((Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture before your time) they married women from the People of the Book.

The Prophet (SAW) said, Yes, keep good relation with her.	0
689	Islam looks at the people of the book, Jews and Christians, with a special view, and an increasing interest appears in their direction: they are followers of a heavenly religion, who share with Muslims the origin of the religion and the message, and it is not surprising when we see in the QurÂan, a recurring talk about their prophets and messengers, and the history of their peoples.	0

697	We have mentioned in previous posts that the pagans of the Middle East during pre-Islamic times may actually refer to Hindus, not Christian pagans. Hindu scriptures refer to their own worshipers as ÂpagansÂ. The HinduÂs are the main polytheistÂs in the world and the Hindu faith spread far beyond their own country. Some sources indicate that Hinduism was prevalent even in the Arabia peninsula. In Hinduism it is often claimed that religious verses and symbols mispronounced or used wrongly, has the opposite effect and becomes malign, destructive and evil. Islam is that distortions of what was Hindu worship in the medieval times.	1
698	"ISLAM THE RELIGION OF SEX: ÂAccording to Prophet Muhammad (SW), the Hurs of Paradise will be pure women, free of menstruation, urine, stool, cough and children. The Hurs will sing in Paradise on divine purity and praiseÂwe are most beautiful Hurs and we are for the honored husbands. Muhammad said that an inmate of Paradise will have the sexual strength of 70 men. Muhammad said, ÂAn inmate of Paradise will have 500 Hurs, 4,000 unmarried women and 8,000 widowed women. Each of them will keep embracing him for the duration of his whole worldly life.Â, Abu Umama narrated: ""The Messenger of God said, 'Everyone that God admits into paradise will be married to 72 wives; two of them are houris and seventy of his inheritance of the [female] dwellers of hell. All of them will have libidinous sex organs and he will have an EVER-ERECT PENIS.' Sunan Ibn Majah, Zuhd (Book of Abstinence). It was mentioned by Daraj Ibn Abi Hatim, that Abu al-Haytham 'Adullah Ibn Wahb narrated from Abu Sa'id al-Khudhri, who heard the Prophet Muhammad PBUH saying, 'The smallest reward for the people of Heaven is an abode where there are eighty thousand(80.000) servants and seventy-two(72 VIRGINS) houri, over which stands a dome decorated with pearls, aquamarine and ruby, as wide as the distance from al-Jabiyyah to San'a. Each time we sleep with a Houri we find her VIRGIN. Besides, the PENIS of the Elected never softens. The erection is ETERNAL; the sensation that you feel each time you make love is utterly DELICIOUS and out of this world and were you to experience it in this world you would faint. Each chosen one [i.e. Muslim] will marry seventy [sic] houris, besides the women he married on earth, and all will have APPETIZING VAGINAS."	1
699	[LetÂs ignore the fact that Muhammad was forcing his religion down the throat of the Jews when he previously stated that there is no compulsion in religion. LetÂs also ignore the fact that the same people who welcomed Muhammad when he was expelled from mecca are being expelled from their land by the same man they opened their doors to years ago.] Muhammad obviously committed shirk here by making himself a partner with allah on ownership of the earth. If Allah claims in the Quran to be the owner and creator of the earth with no partners, how did Muhammad also become a partner? If Muhammad was also a partner owner of the earth, why did Allah forget to mention it in the Quran when he was claiming to be the sole owner of the earth?	1

But bestow on them gift, the rich according to his means, and the poor according to his means, a gift of reasonable amount is a duty on the doers of good.), it was recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d and Abu Usayd, may Allah be pleased with them both, said, ""The Messenger of Allah married Umaymah bint Sharahil, and when she entered upon him he reached out his hand towards her, and it was as if she did not like that, so he told Abu Usayd to give her two garments.'' `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said ""If the dowery had been named, she would not be entitled to more than half, but if the dowery is not been named, he should give her a gift according to his means, and this is the ""handsome manner.''"	0
701	IDOLATRY IN ISLAM: Islam retained many of the rites and rituals that had been prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula. While Muhammad destroyed the rest of the idols at the conquest of Mecca, he left the Black Stone untouched. Why? It was simply due to his deep-rooted reverence for the Black Stone which was brought on by years of submission to the pagan practice of stone worship. Here we find another prominent Muslim scholar who candidly testifies that the Black Stone was indeed worshipped by the Pagans  before the coming of Islam. The fact that many of the rituals performed during the Hajj are connected to pagan worship shows that Islam was conceived in idolatry. Such practices are consistent with pre-Islamic pagan rituals involving the KaÂba.  The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob would never send a Black Stone to entice his worshippers to practice idolatry. If God forbids even the bowing towards the glorious sun that he himself had created, do you think he will command his worshippers to bow towards a dead Black Stone? While Christians can clearly see this as absolute idolatry, Islam is blind to this abomination. Of course, Muslims will strongly deny that the Black Stone is an idol. And they will insist that their prayers are actually directed towards Allah alone. However, in actual practice, the Black Stone is treated with the same reverence that the Pagans show to their idols. A MuslimÂs denial of his idolatrous worship of the Black Stone can be likened to that of a man who pleads innocence for his adulterous affair by claiming that he was only thinking of his wife while committing the illicit sexual act. The justification for the veneration of a dead stoneÂespecially to the extent of bowing down and kissing itÂcan only be identified with the primitive pagan practice of idolatry than with the true spirit of monotheistic worship. It is idolatryÂpure and simple.	1

704	Why does the QurÂan refer to Jews and Christians as kuffar or infidels? What kind of respect and tolerance is that? Answer: Again, here is a big mistake with translation, one that is sometimes committed by Muslims, too. If you look at the English dictionary meaning of infidel, it means someone who does not have a faith or does not believe in Allah. Does the QurÂan say that the Jews and Christians do not believe in Allah? No. Surah 29, Al-`Ankabut, verse 46, says that the God of Christians, Jews, and Muslims is one and the same. The word infidel is an inaccurate translation of the word kafir in this case. The term kafir, referring to a person, or kufr, referring to an act, is used in the QurÂan in a variety of contextual meanings. This is why I hesitate to use even the terms non-believer or disbeliever for the translation, as is it is not clear from these English terms what is the object of unbelief or disbelief: God? a particular prophet? others? I would prefer the term non-Muslim, as it applies to various categories of kufr, whether it refers to knowingly rejecting the message of Islam (disbelief) or being a non-Muslim due to the lack of awareness of the authentic message of Islam (unbelief). Following are examples of the varied contextual uses of the term kufr in the QurÂan: Â· Kufr is sometimes used in a positive sense. A good believer can also be a kafir. How? The QurÂan says ÂFaman yakfur bil taghoout wayuÂmim billah.Â (whoever rejects taghut and believes in Allah) (Al-Baqarah 2:56). Anyone who believes in one thing is a kafir (rejecter) of its opposite. Kufr can be used in a neutral or benign sense, as the origin of kufr in the Arabic language means Âto cover up.Â So the farmer who is putting a seed in the ground and covering it up is performing kufr. Spiritually, deliberate deviation from the true and authentic prophets is a form of Âcover-upÂ of truth. The word kufr can also be applied to a Muslim when he is doing something wrong, but not necessarily something that would place him or her outside the state of belief in Islam. For example, a Muslim who is able to go for Hajj but does not go, without denying the need to go, would be committing an act of kufr in a sense of ungratefulness to Allah (3:96-97). Kufr is used in QurÂan as the opposite of shukr, Âto be gratefulÂ (31:12). Kafir is used in the QurÂan, not only to refer to Jews or Christians, but also those who rejected the prophets and denied the existence of God. It has been used to refer to the people of Noah and the people of Abraham. It has also been used to refer to those who denied prophethood and rejected the existence of Allah altogether, which obviously is not the case with Christians and Jews. It can be used in a more serious sense, but with a variety of meanings. It refers to the rejection of Islam. It describes one who knows the truth, but rejects it out of pride or vanity. This is someone who knows the truth in his or her heart and deliberately rejects it. Nonetheless, we cannot assess this. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) gave Muslims very clear instructions after one incident when people assumed to know why someone professed belief in Islam. He asked them whether they had opened up his heart, did they know whether what was in his heart was sincere. The bottom line is that we have to leave it to Allah; only Allah knows the sincerity of a particular personÂs acceptance. Allah is All-Knowing, and He is the only Judge of all of us.	0
705	Islam has provided the most humane of the rules of combat in existence, and I assure you that Islam does forbid the killing of non-combatants, particularly the killing of women, children, the elderly or disabled, and soldiers who surrender. Considering the importance of the topic against the background of the American invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq, we have been repeatedly giving the details of IslamÃ¯?Â½s rules of combat and other related topics in our Web site. It is evident that we can never have a world here below without the possibility of humans fighting one another. So the best we can strive for is to have a code of rules for war. And it is the merit of Islam that it does provide such rules, which remain ever nobler and more realistic than any other code existing for the conduct of war.	0

707	The injunction against befriending enemies of Islam is even more emphatic when they have upper hand over Muslims, crushing hopes and generating fear in the minds of people. In such a situation, only hypocrites and those who are sick at hearts hasten to befriend them, giving them help today in order to benefit from them tomorrow. Almighty Allah describes this situation as follows: ÂYet thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease racing toward them (the enemies of Islam), saying, ÂWe are afraid that a change of fortune may befall us.Â But it may be that Allah will give (thee) the victory or some decision from Himself, and then they will become regretful for what they thought secretly within themselves.Â (Al-MaÂidah 5:52)	0
708	In having dialogue with the People of the Book, Muslims should avoid such approaches that may cause bitterness or arouse hostility, Allah says: ÂAnd do not dispute with the People of the Book except by (the way) which is best, unless it be with such of them as transgress, and say, ÂWe believe in what has been sent down to us and sent down to you, and our God and your God is one, and to Him do we submit.'Â (Al-`Ankabut 29:46).	0

712	Christians and Jews are not considered fully human in Islam.  The penalty for killing one of them is limited to one-third of the compensation due for unintentionally killing a Muslim.  Muhammad made it clear that a believer cannot be put to death for killing a non-believer, since they are not equal (see Conclusion).  Thus, killing kafir is less serious than engaging in a consenting sexual relationship outside of marriage.	1
713	He Almighty also says the following: ÂO you who believe, do not take My enemy and your enemy as friends, offering them affection, even though they have disbelieved in what has come to you of the truth, driving out the Messenger and yourselves because you believe in Allah, your Lord.Â (Al-Mumtahanah 60:1) This verse was revealed in connection with the pagans of Makkah, who declared war against Allah and His Messenger driving the Muslims out of their homes simply because they said, ÂOur Lord is Allah.Â With this type of people, friendship and alliance cannot be permitted. Yet in spite of this, the QurÂan did not dismiss the hope that one day, there might be a reconciliation; it did not declare utter disappointment in them but encouraged the Muslims to kindle the hope of better understanding and improved relationships, for in the same surah Allah says: ÂIt may be that Allah will bring about affection between you and those who are your enemies from among them. And Allah is All-Powerful, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.Â (Al-Mumtahanah 60:7) This QurÂanic statement gives the assurance that this bitter hostility and deep hatred is something that may pass way, as it is also stated in the hadith, ÂHate your enemy mildly; he may become your friend one dayÂ (Al-Tirmidhi).	0

Let not a group scoff at another group, it may be that the latter are better than the former; nor let (some) women scoff at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former, nor defame one another, nor insult one another by nicknames. How bad is it, to insult oneÂs brother after having Faith [i.e. to call your Muslim brother (a faithful believer) as: ÂO sinnerÂ, or ÂO wickedÂ, etc.]. And whosoever does not repent, then such are indeed Zalimun (wrong-doers, etc.).	0

717	The QurÂan is based completely on the personal experiences of one man spanning a period of 23 years. Only one person allegedly saw the Âangel.Â Only one person allegedly heard the voice. The entire faith is limited to one book with only one person who allegedly received the vision. There is absolutely no way to verify anything. The only way to become a Muslim, then, is to take this one manÂs word for it. When we contemplate the beginning of the QurÂan, with its delivery in the darkness of a cave by a spirit who displayed all the manifestations of a demon right from the start (see part 1 of this series), it is difficult to understand just how anyone can place their conviction and their eternal salvation in a book built upon a foundation as this. Muhammad claimed to be GodÂs final prophet. What supporting evidence is there that the angel Gabriel spoke to him? Are there testimonies of eyewitnesses? As Islamic sources themselves testify, Muhammad is the only witness to his claim that Gabriel spoke to him. One witness is not acceptable in substantiating such an important claim. We cannot accept the sole testimony of Muhammad. Allah even required four male witnesses to prove rape. 	1

This Ayah means, `Fight for the sake of Allah and do not be transgressors,' such as, by committing prohibitions, ""includes mutilating the dead, theft (from the captured goods), killing women, children and old people who do not participate in warfare, killing priests and residents of houses of worship, burning down trees and killing animals without real benefit.''"	0
721	He reported the Prophet as saying, ÂA woman should be concealed, for when she goes out the devil looks at her.Â The basic idea is to lift up the eyes to look at something.
