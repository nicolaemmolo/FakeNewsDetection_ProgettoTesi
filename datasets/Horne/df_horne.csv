0	"NEW YORK, NYÃÂDuring his Sunday interview with 60 Minutes, president-elect Donald Trump revealed that he has arranged to be sworn into the White House on January 20 on a copy of Playboy Magazine, rather than the traditional Bible as most past presidents have done.

Sources were able to confirm that he plans to use the March 1990 issue of the magazine, with Trump himself of the cover, on which he will swear while delivering the sacred oath of office to the nation.

ÃÂTremendous magazine, Playboy. The best magazine. ItÃÂs got beautiful women in it. I love beautiful women,ÃÂ President-elect Trump told reporter Leslie Stahl in the interview.

ÃÂThe BibleÃÂlook, we all know I love the Bible, but to be honest with you, itÃÂs a little boring. No pictures. It talks about women, some, but no pictures,ÃÂ Trump continued. He further stated that the raunchy pornographic magazine lined up more closely with his values than the Bible, which ÃÂhas some real nasty things to say about me.ÃÂ

White House transitional teams confirmed the news, and further stated TrumpÃÂs inauguration will include an open bar, craps tables, and go-go dancers."	0
1	"Congress is preparing to do major battle next month over President-elect Donald TrumpÃÂs secretary-of-state nominee, Rex Tillerson, in a brewing proxy fight over TrumpÃÂs potential financial conflicts of interest and his unconventional foreign policy.

The official sparring is expected to take place on Jan. 11, when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to hold a two-part hearing to grill Tillerson over his tenure as ExxonMobilÃÂs chief executive and what many lawmakers see as unseemly links to Russia.

But behind the scenes on Capitol Hill, the strategizing has already begun.

Democrats do not think they stand much chance of stopping Tillerson from being confirmed. But they plan to press the top diplomat-designate to commit to full divestiture from Exxon and detail how he would pursue a different approach to the world as secretary of state, in what one Senate Democratic aide who requested anonymity to candidly discuss strategy called a ÃÂvery thorough, tough vetting.ÃÂ As they have with Trump, Democrats plan to focus sharply on potential conflicts of interest deriving from TillersonÃÂs finances, as well as his views on critical foreign-policy matters.

ItÃÂs a grilling they would happily give Trump, if only they had reason to drag him before a congressional committee.

Already, the minority party is railing against Republicans for refusing to demand Tillerson produce his tax returns. Their frustration stems from TillersonÃÂs response to a routine question about tax returns on the Foreign Relations CommitteeÃÂs pre-hearing questionnaire. According to a Senate Democratic aide and a Trump transition team spokesman, Tillerson said he stood ready to provide only ÃÂtax return informationÃÂ for himself and his wife for the previous three years. That means itÃÂs possible Tillerson isnÃÂt willing to provide complete returns.

Democrats have demanded that all TrumpÃÂs Cabinet nominees release their tax returns ÃÂ something Trump himself steadfastly refused to do during the campaign, because, he said, the returns were under routine audit.

Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said the GOP would not break with years of precedent to compel Tillerson to turn over his tax returns without good reason, no matter how loud the clamor from Democrats. ÃÂUnless there was a case where thereÃÂs some irregularity thatÃÂs known, the committee just does not ask for tax returns,ÃÂ Corker said in an interview.

Corker said Tillerson is ÃÂnot going to be the proxy [for Trump], because weÃÂre not going to ask for tax returns.ÃÂ

ÃÂI understand there are a number of Democrats who are very upset about President-elect Trump not putting his tax returns,ÃÂ Corker said. ÃÂBut thatÃÂs not going to change the way we go about our committee process.ÃÂ

Senate Democrats believe they can fight miniature versions of the political battles they are waging with Trump during the confirmation hearings for his Cabinet choices ÃÂ particularly those such as Tillerson who hail from the private sector. They intend to focus on TillersonÃÂs four-decade career at a major oil conglomerate and what they ÃÂ and some Republicans ÃÂ see as questionable ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Several Democratic members of the committee have said they also plan to ask Tillerson about human rights and climate change in light of his Exxon work.

Many lawmakers are leaning on Trump to fully divest from his companies because his wide-ranging business empire lends itself at the very least to an appearance of conflicts of interest. Democrats argue TillersonÃÂs business career raises similar questions.

Just how thorny those conflicts may be wonÃÂt be clear until the committee receives TillersonÃÂs financial disclosure statements, documents that Corker expects to have before the end of 2016. Corker plans to give other committee members a copy of the disclosure ÃÂas soon as we have it,ÃÂ providing ample time to review what is expected to be a ÃÂvery extensiveÃÂ document.

Committee Democrats are planning to scour TillersonÃÂs financials once they receive them and are exploring options to beef up their resources by borrowing tax and financial experts from other corners of the Hill or seconding Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department employees to help, according to an aide.

The all-in effort is vital, they argue, because unlike many previous secretaries of state, Tillerson has not had to publicize details about his personal finances. If confirmed, Tillerson would be the first secretary of state in decades who has not previously worked as a public servant or a member of the military.

ÃÂThis proposed nominee for secretary of state will likely be asked more questions than normal. Secretary Kerry was somebody that we knew. Secretary Clinton was somebody that we knew,ÃÂ Corker said. ÃÂSince [Tillerson] will be up under the hood advising the president on foreign policy, a president who hasnÃÂt been involved in foreign policy in his business life, we certainly want to understand fully the kind of advice he would be giving the president as secretary of state.ÃÂ

Part of the logic behind planning a two-part hearing (one session in the morning and one in the afternoon), as Corker put it, is so there can be ÃÂplenty, plenty, plenty of time for people to learn everythingÃÂ they want to from Tillerson.

A particular point of concern for Democrats and Republicans will be TillersonÃÂs relationship and business dealings with Putin, who awarded him the KremlinÃÂs Order of Friendship in 2013. Tillerson also opposed sanctions that the United States imposed on Russia in 2014 as a reaction to the annexation of Crimea and MoscowÃÂs support of separatists in eastern Ukraine, arguing that Exxon lost $1 billion from the policy change.

On Thursday, Corker had a 30-minute conversation with Tillerson in which he questioned him about Russia, with the bulk of that conversation focusing on sanctions. He came away with the impression that Tillerson had no interest in ripping up existing sanctions on Russia, even if he criticized them as ExxonÃÂs CEO.

ÃÂThat would be hugely problematic to this one senator, if I felt that was how we were going to begin the relations with Russia,ÃÂ Corker said, referring to himself. He noted the conversation ÃÂalleviated some of the concernsÃÂ he harbored about TillersonÃÂs relationship with the Kremlin.

Corker said he encouraged Tillerson to start calling other lawmakers on his committee. Tillerson and lead Foreign Relations Committee Democrat Ben Cardin (Md.) also spoke by phone Thursday, but a spokesman for Cardin would not detail what was discussed.

On Tuesday, Tillerson was in Washington, where he met with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who endorsed his nomination. He hopes to meet with as many senators as possible to discuss his nomination, according to the Trump transition team.

ÃÂI think, at least I hope, that when these meetings take place that weÃÂre going to see a Rex Tillerson that has a standard view of RussiaÃÂs malicious activities, nefarious activities,ÃÂ Corker said. ÃÂI got a good sense of how heÃÂd [approach] Russia and Putin, and it was certainly different, if you will, than the picture of him toasting Putin with champagne.ÃÂ

Several key GOP senators ÃÂ including John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) ÃÂ have expressed concerns that TillersonÃÂs ties to Russia could be a dangerous echo of TrumpÃÂs seeming affinity for Putin. Those concerns have taken on even more urgency in wake of CIA allegations that Russia attempted to tilt the election to Trump.

Since the president-elect selected Tillerson, TrumpÃÂs transition team has been rolling out foreign policy heavyweights such as Bob Gates, Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley and Dick Cheney to vouch for TillersonÃÂs global bona fides. Gates, Rice and Hadley run a consulting firm that has Exxon is a client.

Only one Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee ÃÂ Rubio ÃÂ has publicly criticized Tillerson over his Kremlin ties, and he communicated those concerns directly to Corker before the nomination was formally announced.

Democrats need only persuade one Republican to oppose Tillerson to block his nomination in committee. But it is still possible he could get to a floor vote even if the committee rejects him. In the past, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reported out nominations unfavorably, a procedure that expresses the membersÃÂ discontent without blocking the full Senate from voting. In 1983, the full Senate confirmed President Ronald ReaganÃÂs Arms Control and Disarmament Agency nominee, Kenneth Adelman, despite his rejection by the panel.

But Corker expressed confidence that Tillerson would pass the committeeÃÂs test, even if his track record as an oil-company CEO gives members pause.

ÃÂMy sense is, based on the conversation we had, heÃÂs going to very much understand that his job now is to pursue our countryÃÂs national interest,ÃÂ Corker said."	0

Trump Plans To Dissolve His Foundation; N.Y. Attorney General Pushes Back
THE TWO-WAY
Trump Plans To Dissolve His Foundation; N.Y. Attorney General Pushes Back
And in doing so, Trump incorrectly stated the charitable reach of the Donald J. Trump Foundation.

In a series of tweets Monday evening, Trump said he had given millions to the foundation he began in 1987 and that all of the money raised went to ""wonderful charities.""

I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report!
ÃÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016

The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!
ÃÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016
But extensive reporting over the past year has shown those claims to be overstated. According to the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold, who has researched the foundation's donations and expenses for several months, Trump and his companies have given about $6 million to the charity since its launch, according to tax records up to 2015.

However, the president-elect has not given anything to the foundation from 2009 until 2014; his businesses gave to the foundation in 2015 for the first time in several years, according to the Post.

In fact, the two largest donors were professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave $5 million to the foundation from 2007 until 2009. Trump has nominated Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration.

And as Fahrenthold reported during the campaign, not all of the money was solely for charitable purposes. In many cases, spending benefited Trump and his business interests. Trump used his foundation's money to buy a 6-foot-tall portrait of himself for $20,000, and had earlier bought another portrait for $10,000, the Post's reporting showed. He also used the foundation's money to buy an autographed Tim Tebow Denver Broncos helmet for $12,000.

Trump tapped his foundation to help settle lawsuits for his businesses. In one case, Palm Beach, Fla., agreed to forgive fines for Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club if he made a $100,000 donation to a veterans' charity. In another instance, Trump settled a case involving one of his New York golf courses to make a $158,000 donation to a charity of the plaintiff's choosing.

""So if Trump is using this money basically to save his businesses, the money isn't helping people. That's a violation of the letter and the spirit of law,"" Fahrenthold told NPR's All Things Considered on Sunday.

Trump announced on Christmas Eve that ""to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.""

But Trump cannot shutter the foundation just yet since it's under investigation by the New York attorney general, according to the office's spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop raising money in New York in October, saying it wasn't registered by law to be able to do so in the state.

And last year Trump had to pay a $2,500 fine to the IRS when he used $25,000 of the foundation's money to donate to a group supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. At the time, she was weighing whether or not to pursue an investigation into Trump University; ultimately, she decided not to, and this year was a vocal surrogate for Trump.

RealClearPolitics also reported in October that many of the Trump Foundation's donations in recent years went to top conservative or policy groups that could aid Trump as he prepared for a White House run.

'Saving Lives' Or 'Selling Access'? Explaining The Clinton Foundation

'Saving Lives' Or 'Selling Access'? Explaining The Clinton Foundation
Throughout the campaign, Trump took sharp aim at his opponent Hillary Clinton's own family foundation, claiming it was a pay-to-play vehicle for the Democratic nominee and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.

""It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office,"" Trump said at an August rally in Texas. ""They sold access and specific actions by and really for I guess the making of large amounts of money."" Those claims have not been borne out by evidence.

In August, the Clintons vowed to drastically reduce the size of their foundation to avoid appearances of conflict. They denied any insinuation of pay-to-play and defended the work of the Clinton Foundation.

At the time, RNC chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement, ""If everything was above board while Hillary Clinton ran the State Department as the Clintons have said, then why change a thing?""

But now it's Trump and his family who have come under fire for some of the same alleged behaviors. An AP investigation found that Trump's son Eric "" has exaggerated the size of his foundation and the donations it receives. At the same time, the charity's payments for services or donations to other groups repeatedly went to one of Donald Trump's private golf clubs and to charities linked to the Trumps by corporate, family or philanthropic relationships.""

My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with...

ÃÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016
Eric Trump announced last week he would also close his personal foundation after it was auctioning off a coffee with his sister, Ivanka, who is expected to have considerable influence in her father's White House. The president-elect also tweeted about that last Friday, saying it was a ""ridiculous shame"" that Eric would have to stop fundraising for his foundation, which gave much of its money to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.


Back in October, NPR's Joel Rose compared the Trump and Clinton foundations and found some marked differences. While the Clinton Foundation does have hundreds of employees and a large budget, it spent almost 90 cents of every dollar received on charitable causes, such as HIV and malaria prevention in Africa. It's a public charity, meaning it mostly raises money from other people and organizations (including a gift from the Trump Foundation in 2009). And while it did accept money from foreign donors, some of whom wanted meetings when Clinton was secretary of state, ""there's no evidence that big donors got any special favors from the State Department,"" Rose reported.

The Trump Foundation is a private foundation, originally intended to give away Trump's own money. But, as noted earlier, he stopped making personal contributions about eight years ago.

""The Trump Foundation has engaged in documented, flagrant acts of violation,"" said Pamela Mann, a former head of the charities bureau in the New York attorney general's office, told Rose. ""That's really different."""	0
3	"WASHINGTON DC ÃÂ On Monday afternoon, an extremist carried out an attack on Capitol Hill, shooting and injuring a police officer. The man has been identified as Thomas Finnigan, a white supremacist from Maryland. He has been taken into police custody, although currently Capitol Hill, including Congress and and the White House, remain on lockdown.



When the attack was carried out, Finnigan was described by eyewitnesses as trying to leave the visitorÃÂs center, and advance further into either the library, Supreme Court, or even the White House.
ÃÂAll I heard was ÃÂ[expletive removed] Obama! [expletive removed] liberals and ISIS! Make America great again!ÃÂ John Burke, a college student visiting the visitors center stated to ABC News. ÃÂThen we heard gun shots and were immediately instructed to leave the building.ÃÂ



Thomas Finnigan is a 32 year old white supremacist linked towards having a strong affinity for Republican frontrunner Donald Trump on his Facebook. He grew up in a lower class family in Tennessee, and later moved to Maryland. Not much else is known about the shooter.
ÃÂItÃÂs concerning, how some of our own born-and-bred American citizens are turning into terrorists over political unrest,ÃÂ ABC political analyst Ana Cuddy said. ÃÂWhile in my own opinion, I must say I take no issue with the conservatives of the United States in general, this is not the first time a Donald Trump supporter specifically has carried out violent acts towards other members of the population. It is concerning to see how the Republican party has radicalized, and I hope the United States of America can learn its lesson from the treacherous acts Trump incites in our citizens.ÃÂ

4	"Senate Democrats dropped their objections Friday night to a short-term-funding bill to keep the government running, and the bill passed less than an hour before the midnight deadline.

It's become a familiar year-end act for Congress: passing a short-term-funding bill that will keep the government running for a few more months. This funding measure, which passed 63-36, runs out in April.

Despite overwhelming support in the House on Thursday, the spending package hit a roadblock in the Senate, where coal state Democrats staged a late protest to try to alter provisions affecting miners.

The stopgap includes $45 million to continue health benefits for four months for certain retired coal miners, whose coverage was set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats, led by West Virginia's Joe Manchin, wanted a full-year extension, but with little leverage and a shutdown looming, they relented with a promise to reignite that fight in four months.

""Would I have preferred that provision to be more generous? Of course I would have,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""But we'll be back at it in April, and I think it's highly unlikely that we'll take it away.""

With House lawmakers already back home for the holidays on Friday ÃÂ and zero interest from GOP leaders to reopen negotiations ÃÂ Democrats backed down in time to avert a midnight Friday shutdown.

The spending bill keeps the federal government running on autopilot until April 28. Congressional Republicans opted to punt the annual spending bills into next year to wait until President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. With control of both the White House and Congress, Republicans will have more sway over how roughly $1 trillion is spent on federal agencies and programs.

The bill runs through April to buy Congress more time to negotiate the fiscal year 2017 spending bills, because the Senate is expected to be consumed by the confirmation process for Trump administration nominees in the first quarter of next year.

Since the spending bill is a must-pass measure, it also includes some unrelated provisions and additional funding measures. For instance, Senate Republicans included language that will help expedite the confirmation process for Trump's defense secretary nominee, retired Gen. James Mattis.

For Mattis to be confirmed, Congress must waive a law that requires a seven-year cooling-off period for current or former military officials to hold that Cabinet post. Mattis retired in 2013.

Democrats objected to the language, but Republicans said it was necessary to expedite consideration of a critical administration post. The waiver will still be reviewed by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, and it will need to pass a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.

Mattis has been widely praised on both sides of the aisle and is expected to be confirmed, barring something unforeseen coming to light during the confirmation process.

The measure also includes just over $10 billion in Overseas Contingency Funding, better known as the side Pentagon account that funds the ongoing war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

An additional $4.1 billion is directed to disaster relief, including recovery efforts from Hurricane Matthew.

Democrats also secured funding to assist the Flint, Mich., community with repairing its drinking water systems. Some $170 million is directed toward infrastructure improvements and preventive care against lead poisoning for mothers and children.

Congress approved a biomedical research bill this week, and the stopgap spending measure includes funds for new programs authorized in the legislation, such as $352 million to the National Institutes of Health for medical research and $500 million to states to combat the opioid epidemic.

The measure also includes a provision that will prevent a pay raise for members of Congress. The pay freeze has been in place since 2010."	0

6	"In any normal election year, weÃÂd compare the two presidential candidates side by side on the issues. But this is not a normal election year. A comparison like that would be an empty exercise in a race where one candidate ÃÂ our choice, Hillary Clinton ÃÂ has a record of service and a raft of pragmatic ideas, and the other, Donald Trump, discloses nothing concrete about himself or his plans while promising the moon and offering the stars on layaway. (We will explain in a subsequent editorial why we believe Mr. Trump to be the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history.)

But this endorsement would also be an empty exercise if it merely affirmed the choice of Clinton supporters. WeÃÂre aiming instead to persuade those of you who are hesitating to vote for Mrs. Clinton ÃÂ because you are reluctant to vote for a Democrat, or for another Clinton, or for a candidate who might appear, on the surface, not to offer change from an establishment that seems indifferent and a political system that seems broken.

Running down the other guy wonÃÂt suffice to make that argument. The best case for Hillary Clinton cannot be, and is not, that she isnÃÂt Donald Trump.

The best case is, instead, about the challenges this country faces, and Mrs. ClintonÃÂs capacity to rise to them.

Can Hillary Clinton Keep You Safe? SEPT. 24, 2016
The next president will take office with bigoted, tribalist movements and their leaders on the march. In the Middle East and across Asia, in Russia and Eastern Europe, even in Britain and the United States, war, terrorism and the pressures of globalization are eroding democratic values, fraying alliances and challenging the ideals of tolerance and charity.

The 2016 campaign has brought to the surface the despair and rage of poor and middle-class Americans who say their government has done little to ease the burdens that recession, technological change, foreign competition and war have heaped on their families.

Over 40 years in public life, Hillary Clinton has studied these forces and weighed responses to these problems. Our endorsement is rooted in respect for her intellect, experience, toughness and courage over a career of almost continuous public service, often as the first or only woman in the arena."	0
7	"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Donald Trump cannot move ahead with his plan to dismantle his charitable foundation because state prosecutors are probing whether the president-elect personally benefited from its spending, the New York attorney generalÃÂs office said Tuesday.

ÃÂThe Trump foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,ÃÂ said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.

The statement came after Trump announced that he wanted to dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation, part of what his presidential transition team says is an effort to erase any potential conflicts of interest before he takes office Jan. 20.

But the foundationÃÂs inner workings have been the subject of SchneidermanÃÂs investigation for months and could remain a thorny issue for TrumpÃÂs incoming administration. Democrats nationally have said they are ready to raise any legal or ethical issues from TrumpÃÂs global business empire during his presidency.

TrumpÃÂs charity has admitted that it violated IRS regulations barring it from using its money or assets to benefit Trump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation.

President-elect announces he will shutter Trump Foundation
The admissions by the Donald J. Trump Foundation were in a 2015 tax filing made public after a presidential election in which it was revealed that Trump has used the charity to settle lawsuits, make a $25,000 political contribution and purchase items, such as a painting of himself, that was displayed at one of his properties.

The 2015 tax filing was posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar on Nov. 18 by someone using an email address from the foundationÃÂs law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said GuideStar spokeswoman Jackie Enterline Fekeci.

In the tax filing, the foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets in violation of the regulations not only during 2015, but in prior years. But the tax filing doesnÃÂt provide details on the violations.

Schneiderman, a Democrat, launched his investigation into the charity after reporting by The Washington Post drew attention to some of the foundationÃÂs purchases.

Trump asserted on Twitter late Monday that his foundation was run efficiently.

""Before this year ends, I want to thank you again for your support of our campaign,"" Clinton wrote in the email. ""While we didn't achieve the outcome we sought, I'm proud of the vision and values we fought for and the nearly 66 million people who voted for them.""

Clinton also encouraged supporters to keep pressing forward saying she believes it is ""our responsibility to keep doing our part to build a better, stronger, and fairer future for our country and the world.""

But she did not indicate any specific plans for the future.

14	"Republicans on Capitol Hill are already laying the groundwork for a rapid repeal of President ObamaÃÂs signature health-care law beginning on the first day of the new Congress, before President-elect Donald Trump is even sworn in.

But the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it, and how long a transition period to allow before the lawÃÂs insurance would go away.

Hard-liners are pushing to move as fast as possible, bolstered by a GOP base eager to see lawmakers follow through on years of promises. But key congressional leaders are keenly concerned about potentially throwing millions off their insurance plans and repeating what they have long decried as Democratic missteps eight years ago, sparking a fierce political backlash by moving too far, too fast.

While Trump could sign legislation gutting the Affordable Care Act before the spring bloom, a full replacement could take months, if not years.

ÃÂIÃÂd like to do it tomorrow, but reality is another matter sometimes,ÃÂ said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that will help lead the ÃÂrepeal and replaceÃÂ efforts. ÃÂWe have to live with the real world. And the real world right now is that the Democrats wonÃÂt help with anything.ÃÂ

Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, once he gets into office. Now that he's won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)
Hatch and other high-ranking Republican senators are pushing for an extended transition period that could keep large portions of Obamacare in effect until 2019 or beyond, allowing time to carefully craft a replacement and push the final debate past the midterm elections.

Many of them, like Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), have been chastened by conversations with insurers and state regulators who are warning of chaos in the market for individual insurance if Congress moves rashly.

ÃÂI donÃÂt want to leave the 84,000 people in Maine who are buying insurance on the exchange uninsured because, all of a sudden, two-thirds of them who have subsidies have lost that subsidy,ÃÂ Collins said.

But those Republicans are clashing with GOP colleagues ÃÂ many of them sent to Congress in the midterm, anti-Obama waves of 2010 and 2014 ÃÂ who see little reason to dawdle.

ÃÂThe history of this place is, the longer it takes, the more exponentially the probability grows that itÃÂll never get done,ÃÂ said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), elected recently as the new chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. ÃÂRepublicans have been saying they have a replacement plan for over two years, so why do we need three years?ÃÂ

Part of the problem is that Republicans have never been able to agree on a replacement plan, despite railing against Obamacare for nearly eight years now. Their foot-dragging is a function of internal divisions and the political peril of floating a detailed alternative that would be closely evaluated for costs and benefits. Trump has also been vague, promising a ÃÂterrificÃÂ replacement that will provide ÃÂgreat health care at a fraction of the cost.ÃÂ

The current battle centers on when exactly to schedule ObamacareÃÂs sunset. But other fights loom ÃÂ over what precisely a replacement plan should look like, whether ObamacareÃÂs Medicaid expansion will continue, whether lawmakers should also now tackle the future of Medicare, and how Congress should assist insurers during the transition.

The battle lines, however, are familiar, with ÃÂestablishmentÃÂ Republicans on one side and conservative insurgents, mainly in the House, on the other. Those dynamics pushed GOP leaders into increasingly dramatic confrontations with President Obama and last year helped force House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to retire.

Come Jan. 20, Obama will no longer serve as a foil for Republicans, and while Senate Democrats could block parts of a health-care overhaul, the real fight will occur inside the GOP.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor come Jan. 3. But that will only set the stage for a future repeal bill that will have to tackle major decisions such as a sunset date and interim measures to stabilize insurance markets.

So far, Trump and key GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have shied away from taking firm positions on repeal and replace, but they have done little to tamp down the expectations of conservatives expecting a swift and wholesale substitute.

ÃÂWeÃÂre going to repeal Obamacare lock, stock and barrel,ÃÂ Vice President-elect Mike Pence told donors to the conservative Heritage Foundation recently. ÃÂThe number one priority of this administration is to keep that promise to the American people.ÃÂ

Hard-liners on Capitol Hill see Pence and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), TrumpÃÂs pick for health and human services secretary, as allies in their push for quick and decisive action. Pence called on Congress to pass a repeal bill ÃÂwith all deliberate speedÃÂ but pledged only to then ÃÂset into motion a process to replace it.ÃÂ

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday that Republicans would move ÃÂas well and as fast as we can but make sure that the transition does not pull the rug out from under people.ÃÂ

Transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday that Obamacare replacement strategy has been part of discussions Trump and Pence are having with top congressional leaders and that the talks are ongoing.

ÃÂThe idea is to really figure out the sequencing on both the repeal and the replace,ÃÂ he said.

Conservative activists who pushed a take-no-prisoners approach toward the Obama administration say their patience is limited.

ÃÂWhen Republicans have the House, the Senate and the White House, you donÃÂt wait,ÃÂ said Adam Brandon, president and chief executive of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. ÃÂIÃÂm a Cleveland Indians fan. I only get a shot at a World Series every couple decades. When you have a shot to do it, you do it. ThatÃÂs it.ÃÂ

Democrats and many health-care experts are warning that a swift repeal could lead insurers to stop selling policies to individuals on federally mandated exchanges. More than 12 million Americans are covered under those policies.

Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell briefed Senate Democrats on Thursday on the expected unraveling of ObamacareÃÂs insurance exchanges, according to people familiar with her remarks inside the closed-door meeting.

ÃÂDelayed replacement is a situation where it is basically repeal and chaos in terms of what will ensue, because of the uncertainty that will get presented to insurers, providers, consumers and states,ÃÂ Burwell told reporters after the meeting.

Republicans want to end ObamacareÃÂs system of penalties and subsidies. But many ÃÂ including Trump ÃÂ want to continue to ban insurers from denying coverage or sharply increasing rates for the sick.

Experts warn that ÃÂrepeal and delayÃÂ under those conditions would prompt insurers to flee the individual market. Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said insurers could face as much as $3 billion in losses if healthy individuals leave the market once the subsidies and penalties are eliminated.

ÃÂThat $3 billion is the tip of the iceberg,ÃÂ Blumberg said. ÃÂWith all of these changes and the uncertainty, it is hard to predict how bad the risk is going to get.ÃÂ

Keeping insurers in the market during the transition could require Congress to step in with bailout payments, something that would be deeply unpopular among conservative lawmakers.

ÃÂThe insurance industry should understand that thereÃÂs a new sheriff in town,ÃÂ said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a Freedom Caucus member. ÃÂThey signed up for Obamacare, and if they want to make a profit, theyÃÂre going to have to figure out how to make a profit in a free-market insurance industry.ÃÂ

The strategy of repealing Obamacare without first replacing it reflects not only the wishes of the GOP base, but also Senate arithmetic.

There will be a slim 52-to-48 Republican majority come January, and while Republicans can gut Obamacare with a simple majority using arcane budget rules, passing a complete replacement will require 60 votes.

Only by dismantling Obamacare first, Republicans say, will they have a chance to persuade enough Democrats to support a replacement plan ÃÂ and Democrats have already signaled that they will not do so.

ÃÂWe all know we have to repeal it to get them to even settle down and work with us at all,ÃÂ Hatch said.

Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), however, has rejected that strategy. ÃÂWeÃÂre not going to do a replacement. If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it,ÃÂ he told The Washington Post recently.

But the Republican base, prodded by conservative media outlets and well-organized activist groups, has been loath to accept Democratic obstruction as an excuse for inaction.

One prominent activist, Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, suggested that Trump could goose the repeal-and-replace efforts by reversing an administrative ruling that gave financial assistance to 11,000 congressional members and staff who were forced onto the Obamacare exchanges under a compromise included in the original law.

ÃÂI donÃÂt think anyone thinks that youÃÂre going to flip a switch .?.?. but the replacement for it needs to happen quickly,ÃÂ she said. ÃÂWe want it done as quickly as it possibly can be done.ÃÂ

Brandon was even blunter: ÃÂThis is going to be a hard thing for Republicans, but tough [cookies],ÃÂ he said. ÃÂTheyÃÂre going to have to push this through using parliamentary maneuvers, and guess what? ItÃÂs hard.

ÃÂThe political risk in doing nothing is why you got Donald Trump in the first place,ÃÂ he added. ÃÂThe old excuses of having divided government, theyÃÂre gone.ÃÂ

A few strident Obamacare critics are urging activists to soften a bit. ÃÂThey have to look at the complexity of the problem here, and hopefully theyÃÂll recognize that itÃÂs not quite so simple,ÃÂ said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who was first elected in the 2010 tea party wave.

But many others are not.

ÃÂLiterally every Republican member has made this part of their platform in running for Congress,ÃÂ said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), a first-termer who will chair the conservative Republican Study Committee next year. ÃÂWeÃÂve got to act on it.ÃÂ"	0
15	"The suspicious circumstances surrounding the death last week of former U.N. President John Ashe had many wondering whether foul play was involved.

The New York PostÃÂs Page Six reported that after Ashe was found dead Wednesday, the U.N. claimed that he had died from a heart attack. Local police officers in Dobbs Ferry, New York, later disputed that claim, saying instead that he died from a workout accident that crushed his throat.

Adding to the mysterious nature of AsheÃÂs death was the fact that he had been slated to be in court Monday with his Chinese businessman co-defendant Ng Lap Seng, from whom he reportedly received over $1 billion in donations during his term as president of the U.N. General Assembly.

According to an unidentified source who spoke with Page Six, prosecutors had intended to use the latter fact to link Ashe directly to Democrat front-runner Hillary Clinton, with whom he could be seen schmoozing in the picture above.

ÃÂIt would have been very embarrassing,ÃÂ the source added. ÃÂHis death was conveniently timed.ÃÂ

There was no evidence at the moment to corroborate the sourceÃÂs theory of foul play, but that certainly did not stop conspiracy theorists from theorizing about ÃÂwhat really happened.ÃÂ

Those theorists inclined to believe the stories about Hillary and Bill Clinton ordering the murders of their opponents wondered whether the former U.N. president was merely their latest victim

However, AsheÃÂs own lawyer, Jeremy Schneider, strongly disagreed with these theories.

16	"WASHINGTON ÃÂ President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on a vow to repeal what he claims are job-killing federal regulations, including rules limiting power plant emissions, protecting rivers and streams, and preventing banks from reckless lending.

Easier said than done.

The same deliberate process used to enact the Clean Power Plant rule, the ÃÂwaters of the U.S.ÃÂ Clean Water Rule, or regulations under the Dodd-Frank law designed to clamp down on Wall Street usually requires the same long slog to undo them, making quick repeal unattainable.

In general, rule changes originate from the agencies who must offer a legal, scientific or other legitimate reason in defense of the proposed change, and solicit public comments first before a new rule or its repeal can take effect. In most cases, the final rule may not become effective until at least 30 days after its publication in the Federal Register.

ÃÂThe process is laborious, but that shouldnÃÂt stop every agency head from setting it in motion,ÃÂ Andy Koenig, vice president of policy at the Koch-affiliated Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a recent column on the groupÃÂs website. ÃÂThe very fact that it is so time-consuming makes it essential for agencies to start the process immediately.ÃÂ

Republicans seek quick repeal of latest Obama administration regulations
Small businesses can expect policy changes under Trump
But a Republican president and a compliant Congress controlled by Republicans can still do quite a bit in short order to block a host of proposed regulations or reverse rules that were recently implemented. Overall, critics say regulations pose a $4 trillion drag  on to the U.S. economy every year, according to some estimates, though agencies also design rules to maximize economic benefits.

Stakeholders have been weighing in about the rules they'd like to see tossed.

Among them is the House Freedom Caucus, the hard right faction of House lawmakers who have clashed with congressional leaders in recent years. The group Wednesday asked the incoming Trump administration to jettison 227 rules its members view as burdensome, costly or unworkable, including ones setting nutrition standards for school lunches, requiring certain animal and plant inspections, and development of alternative fuels.

Despite some steep hurdles, hereÃÂs what Trump and Congress can do:

Incoming presidents can prevent regulations that have yet to be finalized from ever taking effect.

ItÃÂs standard practice for a new administration to freeze any regulations that are in the pipeline until the incoming regime can review them, said Jerry Ellig, senior research fellow at George Mason UniversityÃÂs Mercatus Center.

President Obama did just than when he came into office in 2009, as did his predecessors.

ÃÂIf itÃÂs something that the current administration has finished and sent to the Federal Register but it isnÃÂt published before Inauguration Day, then itÃÂs easy for a new administration to pull those rules back,ÃÂ he said.

Many could still go forward after the review is complete and the Trump administration supports them.

Congress also has a limited window where it can undo rules with a simple majority vote that cannot be filibustered. 

Such ÃÂresolutions of disapprovalÃÂ must be passed and signed within 60 legislative days from their publication in the federal register and their insertion into the Congressional Record.

Under the Congressional Review Act, agencies must report on their rulemaking activities to Congress and provide lawmakers a legislative roadmap to overturn those rules if they oppose them, according to the Congressional Research Service.

The Mercatus Center lists 172 Obama administration rules adopted since June 9 that could be subject to the review act. They include rules on implementing school wellness policies, regulating municipal solid waste landfills and food labeling guidelines.

But the incoming Congress will have to be picky because the law requires that rule reversals can only be done one at a time. With all the other priorities facing them such as working on a budget and considering TrumpÃÂs nominees, thereÃÂs may not be much floor time for wholesale regulatory rollback, Ellig said.

That hurdle helps explain why the Congressional Review Act has been used only once since it became law 20 years ago. In 2001, Congress and the George W. Bush administration overturned a Clinton administration rule setting an ergonomics standard for the workplace.

Agencies can decide not to enforce certain regulations because theyÃÂre focused on other priorities. Or the Trump administration could choose to stop defending rules if they are the subject of a court challenge.

That passive approach ÃÂis a pretty easy way to undermine laws that are already around and public protections that already exist,ÃÂ said Lisa Gilbert, director of Public CitizenÃÂs Congress Watch, a government watchdog group.

Deciding not to defend the regulation in court wouldnÃÂt guarantee the ruleÃÂs demise.

Affected third parties would likely still be arguing for its enforcement and judges could still rule on the legality of the provision. But it could leave ÃÂopen questions that we would obviously rather have answered about our regulatory state,ÃÂ Gilbert said.

Lawmakers could pass a law undoing the rule.

The cleanest ÃÂ and in many ways steepest ÃÂ path to eliminating a rule is to have Congress approve legislation doing just that.

ThatÃÂs what it will probably take to gut some of the Obama administrationÃÂs most high-profile regulations, such as ones associated with clean water, clean power, overtime protections, the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reform.

Within that category, there are several approaches: using spending bills to insert language known as ÃÂridersÃÂ preventing an agency from allocating funds to enforce a regulation, using a process known as ÃÂreconciliationÃÂ to fast-track bills to undo rules, and passing bills through the regular legislative process.

That last option is least desirable for regulatory reformers because it could take years, and it gives Democrats the chance to stop a rule rollback through filibuster.

None of this includes the executive orders that President Trump could undo with a stroke of his pen, namely President Obama's deportation protections for millions of undocumented immigrants who arrived here as young children.

Trump has already unveiled his plan to tackle regulation reform: ÃÂAsk all department heads to submit a list of every wasteful and unnecessary regulation which kills jobs, and which does not improve public safety, and eliminate them.ÃÂ

Gilbert, with Public Citizen, said itÃÂs hard to predict how many of the Obama-era rules will survive.

ÃÂOur success in (preserving) any of them is going to depend on our ability to make it very clear to the American public ... what it means to take away these things that are so populist, so important,ÃÂ she said. ÃÂNobody wants to lose pay raises theyÃÂve already achieved or protections of their health and their air.ÃÂ"	0
17	"In an unusual move, the remaining scheduled Republican debates will be replaced by a series of wrestling matches that pit the competing presidential candidates against a variety of large bears. ÃÂThe American people are sick and tired of talk, talk, talk, talk, talk,ÃÂ said Evan Reutmaster, the Republican National Committee Press Director/Bear Wrangler. ÃÂThey want action and itÃÂs clear that the candidates who can successfully wrestle and defeat a bear are ready to wrestle the economy, foreign policy, and Barack Obama.ÃÂ

In tonightÃÂs debate, televised live on CNN and Animal Planet, the eight Republican candidates will choose between Greco-Roman and freestyle human-bear wrestling; a lottery has already determined the ursine opponents, from a field including Grizzlies, Giant Pandas, and Asiatic Black Bears. Should the winner of each match actually be a bear, that bear will then be eligible to enter the Iowa Caucuses in February 2012, following appropriate periods of hibernation.

Washington insiders are unsure of what strategies the Republican candidates will bring to these matches, given their limited experience in bear wrestling. ÃÂAside from Rick Perry shooting a coyote, this really levels the playing field,ÃÂ says Republican strategist Pete Hallmeck. ÃÂI have wrestled the bears of tax burdens and out-of-control government,ÃÂ Michele Bachmann told reporters earlier today. ÃÂA real bear should not be a problem, whether itÃÂs a Kodiak or a koala.ÃÂ When it was pointed out that a koala is not actually a real bear, Bachmann asked, ÃÂWhat about Yogi Bear?ÃÂ

18	"NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂGovernor Chris Christie, of New Jersey, called Donald J. Trump a ÃÂgeniusÃÂ on Monday for his controversial plan to burn down the White House to collect insurance money.

Appearing on Fox News, Christie said that TrumpÃÂs scheme to collect fire-insurance payments on the White House would ÃÂmake a serious dentÃÂ in the national debt.

ÃÂItÃÂs not just the White House,ÃÂ Christie told FoxÃÂs Sean Hannity. ÃÂThat building is chock-full of priceless antiques, paintings, and rugs, all of which, when burned, would fetch a pretty penny.ÃÂ

19	"President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Mick Mulvaney, a conservative Republican congressman from South Carolina who is known as a budget ÃÂhawkÃÂ, as director of the Office of Management and Budget.

In a statement issued on Saturday morning ÃÂ shortly after Trump tweeted an inflammatory comment about ChinaÃÂs seizure of a US navy drone in the South China Sea ÃÂ Trump called Mulvaney a ÃÂvery high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nationÃÂs finances and save our country from drowning in red inkÃÂ.

Trump also said that with Mulvaney as his budget director, his administration would make ÃÂsmart choicesÃÂ and ÃÂrenew the American taxpayerÃÂs trust in how their money is spentÃÂ.

Mulvaney said he would help restore ÃÂbudgetary and fiscal sanity ÃÂ after eight years of an out-of-control, tax-and-spend financial agendaÃÂ under Barack Obama.

Like other Trump nominations, the budget directorÃÂs job requires Senate approval.

MulvaneyÃÂs nomination follows a pattern of Trump turning to individuals with records apparently hostile to the agencies they are nominated to lead.

For example, the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, a leading critic of climate change theories, has been nominated to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.

In other such moves, the billionaire and charter schools advocate Betsy DeVos has been nominated as education secretary and the Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, a critic of voting rights legislation, has been nominated as attorney general.

The announcement about Mulvaney was made as Trump, who takes office on 20 January, began his holiday vacation at Mar-a-Lago, his oceanfront club in Palm Beach, Florida.

Mulvaney, 49, was an outspoken critic of the former House speaker John Boehner, who resigned in 2015 amid opposition from fellow Republicans who were members of the House Freedom Caucus. 

His selection points to a strategy by Trump to cut government where he can. The president-elect has recently railed against what he has called a far too expensive new version of the Air Force One aircraft he will use, which Boeing is supposed to build.

ÃÂWith Mick at the head of OMB,ÃÂ Trump said in his statement, ÃÂmy administration is going to make smart choices about AmericaÃÂs budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayerÃÂs trust in how their money is spent.ÃÂ

Mulvaney said: ÃÂEach day, families across our nation make disciplined choices about how to spend their hard-earned money, and the federal government should exercise the same discretion that hard-working Americans do every day,ÃÂ he said.

On Friday night, Trump vowed to seek approval from Congress for $1tn in new spending to rebuild the countryÃÂs crumbling network of roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure as a way to create jobs and make some needed repairs.

ÃÂWe are going to fix our country. ItÃÂs time. We have no choice. ItÃÂs time,ÃÂ Trump said at a rally in Orlando, Florida."	0
20	"The Obama administration is preparing to announce a response, which may include ÃÂcyber-operations,ÃÂ to the alleged Russian interference in last monthÃÂs election, according to a Washington Post report citing anonymous U.S. officials.

The report says that details are still being finalized but are likely to include new economic sanctions.

President Obama has said that his administration would respond to Russian meddling in the U.S. election. 

ÃÂI think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections, that we need to take action and we will -- at a time and a place of our own choosing,ÃÂ Mr. Obama told NPRÃÂs Steve Inskeep earlier this month. ÃÂSome of it may be ... explicit and publicized. Some of it may not be.ÃÂ

Intelligence officials believed Russia was involved in the hacking of Democratic servers last summer. Russia dismisses the charges.

A 2015 executive order, as intended, gives the president the authority to respond to foreign cyberattacks. However, officials concluded that the order did not give the president authority to respond to Russian meddling in American elections, prompting a last-ditch effort within the administration to expand the presidentÃÂs authority on the matter.

According to the Post, officials are also trying to figure out ways to make it difficult for president-elect Trump, who has frequently spoken of improving relations with Russia, from diminishing any response from the Obama administration.

ÃÂPart of the goal here is to make sure that we have as much of the record public or communicated to Congress in a form that would be difficult to simply walk back,ÃÂ the Post quotes a senior administration official as saying.

The announcement of the response could come as early as this week, the paper states. Officials quoted in the story say they hope to create a deterrent against future election meddling by other nations.

ÃÂAs much as I am concerned about what happened to us in the election, I am also concerned about what will happen to us in the future,ÃÂ the Post quotes an administration official as saying.

21	"We are really ready for this presidential election to be over. WeÃÂre ready for an end to the rancor and tackiness.

Voters on both sides feel frustrated, even embarrassed by it all. There is a visceral fear, an angst about the result. What if so and so wins? When we wake up to November 9, post-election, when the confetti is swept away and the election is finally over, what will we see?

I have a prediction. I know exactly what November 9 will bring. Another day of GodÃÂs perfect sovereignty.

He will still be in charge. His throne will still be occupied. He will still manage the affairs of the world. Never before has His providence depended on a king, president, or ruler. And it wonÃÂt on November 9, 2016. ÃÂThe LORD can control a kingÃÂs mind as he controls a river; he can direct it as he pleasesÃÂ (Proverbs 21:1 NCV).

On one occasion the Lord turned the heart of the King of Assyria so that he aided them in the construction of the Temple.  On another occasion, he stirred the heart of Cyrus to release the Jews to return to Jerusalem. Nebuchadnezzar was considered to be the mightiest king of his generation. But God humbled and put him in ÃÂdetentionÃÂ for seven years.  ÃÂThe kingdom is the LordÃÂs, and He rules over the nationsÃÂ (Psalms 22:28).

Understanding GodÃÂs sovereignty over the nations opens the door to peace. When we realize that God influences the hearts of all rulers, we can then choose to pray for them rather than fret about them. Rather than wring our hands we bend our knees, we select prayer over despair.             

Jeremiah did this. He was the prophet to Israel during one of her darkest periods of rebellion. He was called ÃÂthe weeping prophetÃÂ because he was one. He wept at the condition of the people and the depravity of their faith. He was so distraught that one of his books was entitled Lamentations. But then he considered the work of God. Note the intentionality of his words:

This I recall to my mind,

Therefore I have hope.

The LORDÃÂs lovingkindnesses indeed never cease,

For His compassions never fail.

They are new every morning;

Great is Your faithfulness.

(Lam. 3:21-23)

Imitate Jeremiah. Lift up your eyes. Dare to believe that good things will happen. Dare to believe that God was speaking to us when he said: ÃÂIn everything God works for the good of those who love himÃÂ (Romans 8:28).

Many years ago, I spent a week visiting the interior of Brazil with a long-time missionary pilot. He flew a circuit of remote towns in a small plane that threatened to come undone at the slightest gust of wind. Wilbur and Orville had a sturdier aircraft.

I could not get comfortable. I kept thinking that the plane was going to crash in some Brazilian jungle and IÃÂd be gobbled up by piranhas or swallowed by an anaconda.

I kept shifting around, looking down, and gripping my seat. (As if that would help.) Finally, the pilot had had enough of my squirming. He looked at me and shouted over the airplane noise. ÃÂWe wonÃÂt face anything I canÃÂt handle. You might as well trust me to fly the plane.ÃÂ

Is God saying the same to you? If so, make this your prayer:

Dear Lord,

You are perfect. You could not be better than you are.

You are self-created. You exist because you choose to exist.

You are self-sustaining. No one helps you. No one gives you strength.

You are self-governing. Who can question your deeds? Who dares advise you?

You are correct. In every way. In every choice. You regret no decision.

You have never failed. Never! You cannot fail! You are God! You will accomplish your plan.

You are happy. Eternally joyful. Endlessly content.

You are the king, supreme ruler, absolute monarch, overlord, and rajah of all history.

An arch of your eyebrow and a million angels will pivot and salute. Every throne is a footstool to yours. Every crown is papierÃÂmÃÂ¢chÃÂ© to yours. No limitations, hesitations, questions, second thoughts, or backward glances. You consult no clock. You keep no calendar. You report to no one. You are in charge.

And I trust you.

Circle November 9 on your calendar and write upon it the words: Our good God rules the world."	0
22	"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) ÃÂ Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 14302, which makes it illegal to perform the national anthem at sporting events nationwide. Under the new order, it is now illegal to perform or recite the national anthem in any public venue. Because the anthem is primarily performed before sporting events, this is where the new order will have its biggest impact. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to 5,000 dollars and up to one year in federal prison.



The president said that his decision is a show of solidarity with the athletes who have been taking a knee during the anthem to protest police brutality. The President went on to say that the language used in the anthem is ÃÂviolentÃÂ and ÃÂhostile to African Americans.ÃÂ

ÃÂIf the recent protests by athletes like San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick have taught us anything, itÃÂs that the anthem is far too violent and far too polarizing to have any place in the national discourse. Our nation is being torn apart by a song, a song that is outdated and, jingoistic. Without swift action, we cannot move forward as a nation; we cannot heal the wounds of racial division. How can we expect our police officers to stop killing African Americans when the very song of our nation is one that glorifies killing?ÃÂ

Obama said that he would consider rescinding the order if Congress can come up with a politically correct version that more accurately reflects our changing values as a nation.

ÃÂThe days of the United States being a domineering world power that seeks to police the entire world through military force are coming to an end,ÃÂ Obama said. ÃÂWe need an anthem that reflects the nation we are becoming, not the nation we used to be.ÃÂ

It has now been over two months since Kaepernick was first spotted sitting down as the national anthem was sung at a preseason NFL game because he refused to ÃÂshow pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.ÃÂ

In a relatively short period of time, his protest of police brutality and racial injustice in the United States has captivated the country and sparked a debate not only about the state of race relations in America, but about what exactly it means to be a patriot.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of President ObamaÃÂs decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in NovemberÃÂs general election. She echoed his concerns about the anthemÃÂs militaristic language and called it one of the last remnants of slavery.



Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had some harsh words for both President Obama and democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over the new Executive Order.

ÃÂThe hatred that President Obama and crooked Hillary have for this country really knows no bounds,ÃÂ Trump said at a press conference this morning in southern Iowa. ÃÂI can tell you that when IÃÂm elected IÃÂll have them both thrown in jail, and IÃÂll make sure that they have to listen to the anthem in their jail cells all day long. I just hope we can stop them from rigging the election.ÃÂ

Chicago Cubs third baseman Paul Horner said that he will refuse to play until the PresidentÃÂs order is reversed.

ÃÂThe national anthem is part of the game,ÃÂ Horner told ESPN. ÃÂHe might as well outlaw peanuts and crackerjacks. We always sing the anthem before we play ball, so if they arenÃÂt going to sing the anthem, IÃÂm not going to play ball. I think youÃÂre going to find that IÃÂm not the only one who feels this way. IÃÂve already got at least ten teammates who are ready to join me in a show of solidarity. I really think we can start a trend here.ÃÂ

The reaction to the new Executive Order has not been all negative, however. Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall, who has himself taken a knee in protest of the National Anthem, called this ÃÂA great day not just for African Americans, but for all Americans who value freedom.ÃÂ He said that ÃÂencouraging people to sing a song that contains such blatant nationalism and militarism makes us no better than North KoreaÃÂ, and causes the majority of Americans to behave like ÃÂa pack of rabid, mind-controlled zombies.ÃÂ

Obama also managed to garner the support of MLB commissioner Rob Manfred.

ÃÂPeople like to watch sports because they provide a distraction from their day to day lives.ÃÂ the commissionerÃÂs office told CNN via e-mail. ÃÂThere no need to taint that with political statements. I applaud the PresidentÃÂs leadership on this difficult issue.ÃÂ



Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the ban.

ÃÂThis is a story about President Obama banning the National Anthem at sporting events around the country,ÃÂ Bradley said. ÃÂI just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.ÃÂ

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told CNN he disagrees with the President

ÃÂWhat the President really needs to do is put a ban on masturbation in this country. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then weÃÂll burn in Hell for eternity.ÃÂ

While Executive Order 14302 is likely to be challenged in court, experts say it could be tied up for years, meaning that it is unlikely to be reversed before it takes effect on December 1st. In the meantime, they say to expect numerous protests from those who disagree with the presidentÃÂs decision.

The Obama Administration has set up a special 24-hour hotline to address any questions and concerns regarding the new Executive Order. The number for the hotline is (785) 273-0325."	1
23	"Donald Trump was promised a smooth and respectful transition by President Barack Obama, but itÃÂs been anything but. ObamaÃÂs massive ego and thin skin now has him publicly degrading TrumpÃÂs landslide Electoral College victory and diligently working behind the scenes to thwart the will of the people.

Barack Obama sat in the Oval Office with Donald Trump about one month ago and vowed to do his best to foster a peaceful transition of power and to carry out the desire of the American people. Those lofty sentiments turned snarky quickly when it came time for Obama to start packing up his belongings and vacate the peopleÃÂs house.

Over the course of the past month, Obama added a record number of new regulations across a myriad of federal agencies that try to control our lives ÃÂ and livelihoods. In the past few days, he surpassed his own record and likely isnÃÂt done trying to curtail President-Elect TrumpÃÂs authority after he is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.

Obama instructed his ambassador to the United Nations to abstain from a vote which drastically impacted one of our most staunch allies, Israel. A veto by the United States, which has been done in the past, would have prevented the U.N. Security Council from attempting to create a ÃÂtwo-state solutionÃÂ between Israel and the Palestinians by demanding that settlement building in disputed areas cease immediately.

Very quietly, Obama also welcomed more than 2,000 new Muslim refugees onto American soil. These people, largely men, already had their asylum requests denied by the Australian government. They were being held in a detention facility when Obama decided the American taxpayers should begin paying for their resettlement ÃÂ regardless of the risks to national security.

President Obama had heralded George W. BushÃÂs commitment to a respectful transition and promised his distraught staff would adhere to the same level of professionalism and decorum. Instead, he led the charge to behave like a petulant spoiled child himself.

First, Michelle Obama sat down for a chat with Oprah Winfrey and claimed America is now without hope. Tens of millions of Americans are feeling hopeful for the first time in eight years, but those of us who live in flyover country or are part of blue collar communities or the middle class really donÃÂt matter to liberals.

Lashing out at Donald Trump because We the People chose him over a corrupt, lying career politician simply showcases how shallow and self-involved Barack Obama and his wife truly are. There is nothing Democrats in Congress can do to stop TrumpÃÂs agenda from passingÃÂthanks to Harry ReidÃÂs short-sighted pushing for the ÃÂnuclear option.ÃÂ

Michael Moore and his horde of liberal followers will not be able to stop Trump from being sworn in on January 20 ÃÂ nor will they succeed in pushing his oath-taking ceremony inside. The efforts of #Disrupt20 protesters will fail just as surely as Jill SteinÃÂs recount endeavors.

If Barack Obama wanted his legacy to involve appearing small, glib, and completely delusional, he has succeeded. He is now nothing more than a frustrating nuisance for President-Elect Donald Trump and the patriotic Americans who cast ballots in his favor. Soon Obama will finally be gone, and Trump can repeal his foolish liberal regulations and executive orders and put the nation back on the track to greatness and prosperity for ALL!"	1
24	"There were two notable Trumpworld headlines Wednesday morning. One was the news that Corey Lewandowski ÃÂ Donald Trump's former campaign manager who remained part of his inner circle long after leaving that job ÃÂ had just opened a ÃÂfull service government relations and consulting firmÃÂ half a block from the White House.

The other was that the president-elect is apparently over ÃÂdrain the swamp.ÃÂ

That's according to Newt Gingrich, a top ally who told NPR in an interview that aired Wednesday morning that he was instructed not to use the phrase anymore because it has fallen out of favor with Trump.

ÃÂI'm told he now just disclaims that,ÃÂ Gingrich said on ÃÂMorning Edition.ÃÂ ÃÂHe now says it was cute, but he doesn't want to use it anymore.ÃÂ

Gingrich said he had ÃÂwritten what I thought was a very cute tweet about 'the alligators are complaining,'"" but that ÃÂsomebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff.ÃÂ

Gingrich actually drafted two tweets in recent days about draining the swamp ÃÂ tweets that apparently earned him the rebuke.


But this should really come as no surprise. Trump himself has acknowledged his on-again, off-again relationship with the phrase. And it actually wasn't a mainstay in the campaign until the final days.

Trump freely admitted that he never much liked the phrase, in fact. But he said that his crowds had prevailed upon him to embrace it.

""'Drain the swamp.' We put it in about two days ago. I said, 'Drain the swamp.' I didn't like it. I didn't like the expression: 'Drain the swamp in Washington,'"" Trump said Oct. 26 at a rally in North Carolina. ÃÂSo I said it three days ago; the place went crazy. I said, 'You know what? I'm starting to like that expression.' And now it's a hot ÃÂ it's like trending all over the world.ÃÂ

Trump explains why he ÃÂdidnÃÂt likeÃÂ the phrase ÃÂdrain the swampÃÂ but now does  Play Video0:39

As admissions of political expediency go, this is pretty forthcoming.

But it's also worth noting here that Trump's flip on this phrase seems to have come pretty suddenly. Just a day before Gingrich's first tweet above, Trump promised in Alabama to ÃÂdrain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C.ÃÂ He said the same in Orlando the day before and in Hershey, Pa., the day before that.

So it's not clear whether a specific story or cable news item ÃÂ which have a tendency to draw instant Trump policy directives and declarations ÃÂ might have influenced this change of course, if indeed it sticks. But what's clear is that Trump's efforts to ÃÂdrain the swampÃÂ have increasingly been derided and scoffed at as he has named a Goldman Sachs executive to head the Treasury Department and politicians and fellow billionaires to lead other departments. And then there are the many possible conflicts of interest.

BALDWIN-AS-TRUMP: No, that's too many things. Just smush them together.

The sketch earned an immediate rebuke from Trump. It's not clear whether he objected to this particular passage ÃÂ his visage was compared in the sketch to a plate of mashed potatoes, after all ÃÂ but you can bet Trump has noticed the derisive coverage of his pledge to ÃÂdrain the swamp.ÃÂ

Just as it was an attractive mantra on the campaign trail, it's become an easily accessible counterpoint to Trump's ongoing struggles with his business empire, conflicts of interest and Cabinet picks that don't really jibe with his promise to shake up Washington.

And given that he never really liked the phrase, it should be no surprise he might be willing to drop it like a bad habit."	0

26	"Indianapolis, IN ÃÂ Some are calling Donald TrumpÃÂs recent revelation a low blow and dirty politics. Some are calling it fair play in a very dirty game. This morning via Twitter as promised, Donald Trump spilled the beans about his opponent, LyinÃÂ Ted CruzÃÂ wife, Heidi. In a Skype interview with Donald Trump this morning, The Scooper was able to get some clarification in this new aspect of the Trump, Cruz feud.

ÃÂLyinÃÂ Ted Cruz is married to a former call girl. ItÃÂs terrible. So terrible,ÃÂ stated the Donald. ÃÂI mean, LyinÃÂ Ted Cruz thinks that Americans want a call girl in the White House? ItÃÂs terrible. Just terrible,ÃÂ rambled Mr. Trump.

When asked how he came to be in possession of this information, Mr. Trump responded, ÃÂItÃÂs terrible. I didnÃÂt want to have to spill the beans. But I warned him (Cruz) not to go down this path. I warned him. ItÃÂs terrible. He put out an attack ad about my wife. ItÃÂs terrible, terrible. I warned him. But, he wants to play dirty. I know about a lot of skeletons in GOP closets. ItÃÂs terrible. That is why the GOP is so very, very afraid of me. They know that I know, and they know that I will say what I know if I have to say what I know. You know? ItÃÂs terrible. Just horrible.ÃÂ

When asked why he thought this was terrible, the Scooper asked a follow-up question.

ÃÂHow do you know, and is your assertion that Heidi Cruz is a former call girl the truth?ÃÂ

ÃÂWell, I have been in the same room with her when she has committed these terrible, terrible acts. I have pictures! I have video!ÃÂ exclaimed The Donald. ÃÂShe is sitting there, dialing the phone. One poor person after another having to endure unsolicited calls from this girl. She wouldnÃÂt stop. She called, and called, and called. ItÃÂs terrible. Horrible. And the things she says to these poor voters. Horrible.ÃÂ

At this point, some woman with a lazy eye came into frame, screamed, and our connection went dead."	1
27	"Donald Trump has requested to have a meeting with Charles Koch of the Koch Brothers to discuss his campaign going forward. Now I know some of you may be thinking ÃÂBut we donÃÂt want Donald in bed with the Kochs!ÃÂ

Well, hold on a second. This may be genius. You see, in reality, the Kochs WILL end up funding one of the 2 main party candidates, either Trump or Clinton. If Trump can ensure they do NOT support the Clinton campaign, he can effectively deprive her of billions while securing some for himself.



But thatÃÂs not all. Unlike normal politicians, Donald Trump is not coming into the meeting absolutely NEEDING their cash. In fact, he has more than enough of his own to whoop Hillary Clinton back to 1967! This gives him what professional negotiators call a ÃÂPower Position.ÃÂ

See, his popular support amongst the people and his own money mean that the Kochs NEED HIM if they want to maintain their corrupt empire and vast fortune. Since itÃÂs not mutual, how could they say no?

So I am proud to see Donald Trump leveraging his position to build a war chest so MASSIVE that all the Clinton media ties in the world will not be able to stop the infinite momentum of the Trump Train."	1
28	"WASHINGTON ÃÂ The FBI warrant that shook Hillary ClintonÃÂs 2016 presidential campaign in its final two weeks has been unsealed, and the lawyer who requested it says it offers ""nothing at all"" to merit the agency's actions leading up to the Nov. 8 election.

The warrant was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Los Angeles lawyer Randy Schoenberg, who wants to determine what probable cause the agency provided to suspect material on disgraced congressman Anthony WeinerÃÂs computer might be incriminating to Clinton. Weiner is the estranged husband of ClintonÃÂs top aide, Huma Abedin. Under the Fourth Amendment, search and seizure can only be granted when proof of probable cause of criminal findings has been documented.

The letter confirms news reports in late October that the FBI had detected ÃÂnon-content header informationÃÂ suggesting correspondence with accounts involved in its already-completed investigation of Clinton's private email server. The FBI request concludes there is ÃÂprobable cause to believeÃÂ that the laptop contained ÃÂevidence, contraband, fruits and/or items illegally possessed,ÃÂ without providing specifics.

""I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between"" Clinton and Abedin, Schoenberg said in an email to USA TODAY. It remains unknown ""why they thought they might find evidence of a crime, why they felt it necessary to inform Congress, and why they even sought this search warrant,"" he said. ""I am appalled."" The FBI's Manhattan office did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

Clinton campaign officials echoed Schoenberg's complaints Tuesday. Campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on Twitter that the ""unsealed filings regarding Huma's emails reveals Comey's intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time.""

New emails under review in Clinton case emerged from Weiner probe
FBI declares it is finally done investigating Hillary Clinton's email
The FBI concluded in July that there was no ÃÂclear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate lawsÃÂ and that ÃÂno reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.ÃÂ Then, two weeks before the election, Comey sent a three-paragraph letter to Congress that said in the course of an unrelated investigation investigators found emails that ÃÂappear to be pertinentÃÂ to ClintonÃÂs private email server. Comey also wrote that he could not assess whether the material was ÃÂsignificant.ÃÂ

The letter was so vague that ClintonÃÂs opponents seized on it to shift the narrative from a damaging drumbeat of news stories about Donald Trump, including his past treatment of women. Trump called it ÃÂbigger than WatergateÃÂ and predicted that the FBI would ""right the ship"" after previously deciding against criminal charges.

ComeyÃÂs investigation was the primary cudgel for Trump and his supporters, who claimed ÃÂ falsely ÃÂ that Clinton was guilty of ÃÂcriminalÃÂ activity. His large rallies regularly chanted ÃÂLock her up!ÃÂ and ClintonÃÂs motorcade was greeted in city after city with angry crowds waving signs.

AbedinÃÂs lawyers have also been requesting permission to review the warrant, which they say their client never saw and hadnÃÂt or even been alerted to, preventing them from responding publicly in the final days of the campaign. Two days before the election, Comey confirmed there was no new information.

At the same time, Comey was in possession of evidence showing Russia was hacking into the Democratic Party apparatus, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., accused him of holding back ÃÂexplosiveÃÂ information about Russian interference.

Republicans have mocked the ClintonsÃÂ contention and said itÃÂs an excuse for some of the strategic mistakes the campaign made.

Yet the election was decided by the smallest of margins in a handful of Rust Belt states. Nate Silver, a leading elections statistician and editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight, says ÃÂComey had a large, measurable impact on the race"" and that she ÃÂwould almost certainly be president-elect if the election had been heldÃÂ the day before the letter. He cited late-deciding voters breaking strongly against her enough to cost her Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Schoenberg said more information needs to be made public before the matter is put to rest. ""The FBI agentÃÂs name has not been disclosed, but I think that it may be appropriate to find out his/her name and determine what the motivations were, since it must have been obvious to the FBI that there was no real probable cause to believe they would find evidence of a crime,"" he said in a follow-up email.  ""It was very wrong for Director Comey to give that impression.""

29	"Trump might be able to reverse it, but itÃÂs tricky.

HeÃÂs only got a few weeks left to damage AmericaÃÂs energy independence. Obama needs to work fast, and he is. Ever the creative one, Obama has found a way to twist the original intent of a law passed in 1953 to enact bans on offshore drilling in massive sections of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The law was never intended to facilitate any such action, as The Hill explains, but since when does Obama consider himself constrained by the law?

Obama will use a section of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to implement the protections, Bloomberg and The New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the plans.

ItÃÂs unclear, however, how large ObamaÃÂs protected areas will be.

The action would answer calls from environmentalists to implement so-called 12(a) protections in the Atlantic and Arctic as a more lasting legacy against fossil fuels from Obama.

Obama last month made final a plan for offshore drilling lease sales from 2017 to 2022 that excludes the Atlantic and Arctic.

But that planÃÂs time period is limited, and President-elect Donald Trump can revise the plan to insert lease sales if he wishes.

Previous presidents have used the 1953 law rarely. In each case, they focused on small areas of water and set time limits in an effort to protect particular species.

ItÃÂs unclear how easily Trump can undo the protections, since no previous president has tried to roll back a predecessorÃÂs actions under that law. Congress may also step in to undo ObamaÃÂs actions.

This is a classic act of recklessness on ObamaÃÂs part ÃÂ applying a law beyond all recognition of its original intent, and telling American oil companies they canÃÂt explore gigantic portions of the world. Just because heÃÂs Barack Obama and he hates fossil fuels. He also leave a mess for Donald Trump to try to clean up, if he can.

Can he?

Maybe. The most effective way for Trump to reverse ObamaÃÂs heading-out-the-door finger in the eye to AmericaÃÂs oil industry, if not necessarily the simplest, would be to ask Congress to make an amendment to the law, essentially nullifying ObamaÃÂs actions. He could also amend ObamaÃÂs drilling lease plan for the period of 2017-2022 by adding more leases, conceivably in the areas of the Atlantic and Arctic where Obama is trying to ban them.

What Trump might try to do instead is simply declare that ObamaÃÂs action under the law is null and void at the executive level, and substitute his own. ItÃÂs not clear how much force of law ObamaÃÂs action has, although itÃÂs not purely an executive order because he did take the action under an existing statute ÃÂ albeit very far afield from the original intent of the statute.

I suspect that if Trump simply tries to reverse ObamaÃÂs actions unilaterally, there will be political resistance but no real constituency with an avenue to effectively prevent TrumpÃÂs action.

There is some luxury of time here, because at the moment most American oil companies who engage in offshore drilling do so almost exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico. Offshore drilling in the Pacific has also been made very difficult by political resistance, and that could also be a challenge for TrumpÃÂs new EPA.

In the meantime, Obama shows us once again that his priority above all else is the service of a left-wing ideological agenda. If he wanted to enact this ban at any point during his presidency, he could have done so and dealt with the political blowback. Instead, he waited until the final weeks of his presidency so he could lay this trap for his successor, and for the nation, to deal with.

As relieved as we are that we will never have to talk about President Hillary, the end of President Obama canÃÂt come soon enough either."	1

UPDATE: Poe deleted his tweet and then claimed that he never made the comments. The tweet is archived here and a screenshot of it appears below.

HeÃÂs now whining about ÃÂslanderÃÂ. Talk crap, then play the victim when you get challenged on your crap. Same process EVERY time with social justice warriors.

Prominent ÃÂBlack Lives MatterÃÂ activist and rapper Tef Poe has a message for ÃÂwhite peopleÃÂ: If Donald Trump wins the presidency, ÃÂniggasÃÂ will ÃÂincite riots everywhereÃÂ.

ÃÂDear white people if Trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go. Just so you know,ÃÂ Poe tweeted today.

He followed up with another promise: ÃÂTrump wins aint no more rules fammo. WeÃÂve been too nice as is.ÃÂ

Poe is by no means a nobody, he has appeared in innumerable articles charting the rise of ÃÂBlack Lives MatterÃÂ and was credited with coining the phrase, ÃÂThis ainÃÂt your grandparentsÃÂ civil rights movement.ÃÂ

The rapper was one of the co-founders of Hands Up United, a ÃÂsocial justiceÃÂ organization that emerged after the death of Michael Brown that was responsible for coordinating large BLM protests in the St. Louis area.

St. Louis was hit by riots in August last year as police were forced to use tear gas to disperse demonstrators who threw bricks and bottles at officers.

The ÃÂhands up, donÃÂt shoot!ÃÂ mantra was later discredited by DNA and autopsy evidence that confirmed Michael Brown did not have his hands up when he was shot by Officer Darren Wilson.

PoeÃÂs threat to incite riots comes on the same day as it emerged that some of the radical groups involved in shutting down Donald TrumpÃÂs rally in Chicago last week are planning a ÃÂmass civil disobedience movementÃÂ beginning next month.

Donald Trump himself also warned that any attempt by the GOP establishment to steal the nomination from him may result in civil unrest.

ÃÂI think you would have riots. I think you would have riots,ÃÂ Trump told CNNÃÂs Chris Cuomo this morning. ÃÂI think you would see problems like youÃÂve never seen before. I think bad things would happen. I really do.ÃÂ

Trump was quickly blasted by many sectors of the media for invoking the prospect of riots, a sentiment that wasnÃÂt seen immediately after the riots in Ferguson, Missouri, when publications like Time Magazine argued that rioting was a justifiable form of protest."	1
31	"CAMBRIDGE, Ma. ÃÂ A groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at MIT suggests Americans living in the United States could find themselves outnumbered by illegal immigrants by a staggering ratio of at least two to one within the next ten years unless significant changes are made to U.S. immigration policy.

ÃÂIf we continue traveling at our current trajectory, we as Americans will soon become a minority in our own country,ÃÂ warned Dr. Emilio Martinez. Using satellite imagery obtained from the National Reconnaissance Office, Dr. Martinez and his team were able to map the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States over a ten-year period. ÃÂWhat weÃÂve seen is an incremental increase of twenty-three per cent over the last decade in the flow of undocumented individuals crossing over our southern border.ÃÂ

The U.S. Census Bureau projects the U.S. population will reach just over 345 million people by 2025. However, according to Dr. Martinez, the current data doesnÃÂt factor in the millions of undocumented persons arriving in the United States each year. ÃÂOur models show that if this trend continues, the population of the United States by 2025 will reach approximately 621 million with just under forty-nine per cent consisting of American citizens,ÃÂ Martinez explained, adding that the data is offset by a 2% margin of error.

In contrast, the population of Mexico, which currently rests at about 126.3 million, is expected to shrink drastically over the next ten years due, in part, to rapidly changing climates and the countryÃÂs ongoing internal conflict with violent drug traffickers. ÃÂMexicans -as weÃÂve seen over the last quarter century ÃÂ have already begun to emigrate north into the U.S. and Canada,ÃÂ said Luis Garcia, a third-year statistics major at MIT who serves as an assistant to Dr. Martinez. ÃÂThese numbers, while relatively small, are expected to rise exponentially over the next four decades.ÃÂ

GarciaÃÂs data shows that by 2050, a number of Central and South American countries including Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, could see their populations dwindle below 2.5 million. ÃÂThese people arenÃÂt simply disappearing,ÃÂ said Garcia. ÃÂOn the contrary, theyÃÂre coming to the United States.ÃÂ"	1

Electors in those and other states ratified Trump's victory in Monday meetings of the Electoral College.

Despite the efforts of anti-Trump organizations, only two electors defected from the Republican candidate; five Democratic electors refused to vote for Clinton.

35	"A record number of Americans signed up for Obamacare Thursday on what they thought would be the last day to enroll in health insurance coverage that starts in the new year, President Barack Obama said Friday.

So many people visited the federal government website that the administration extended the deadline until early next week to give more people time to sign up for what could be the last year of Obamacare coverage.

The Republicans who will control Congress and the White House starting next month say they'll repeal the law that provides the insurance markets as soon as they can ÃÂ although there's no clear plan for how, when or what to put in its place.

Obama plugged the health insurance marketplace, the centerpiece of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, in his last press conference of the year before heading to Hawaii for vacation.

""Yesterday was the biggest day ever for Healthcare.gov. More than 670,000 Americans signed up to get coverage,"" Obama said.

""SINCE I SIGNED OBAMACARE INTO LAW, OUR BUSINESSES HAVE ADDED MORE THAN 15 MILLION NEW JOBS.""
That's compared to 600,000 sign-ups last year on the Dec. 15 deadline.

Obama said when he took office, 44 million Americans lacked health insurance. ""Today, we have covered more than 20 million of them,"" he said. ""For the first time in history, more than 90 percent of Americans are insured.""

Republican opponents of Obamacare don't dispute the coverage numbers but say the law has failed to bring down costs for consumers, as had been promised.

Premiums have risen as insurance companies taking part in the exchanges have struggled to make the profits they seek given the other restrictions imposed by the law. Obamacare limits the ability to charge higher premiums for women and older people, and it forces insurers to take all comers, even people who are already sick.

But the publicity over higher premiums didn't seem to scare off new customers. The Department of Health and Human Services said more than 4 million people have signed up for coverage on Healthcare.gov, compared to about 2.8 million enrollments by the first week of December last year. That includes 1.1 million people not covered before and 2.9 million renewals.

""YESTERDAY WAS BIGGEST DAY EVER FOR HEALTHCARE.GOV. MORE THAN 670,000 AMERICANS SIGNED UP TO GET COVERAGE.""
Most people who buy private insurance on the health insurance marketplaces get a hefty federal subsidy to help pay the premiums. An analysis by the Center for Health and Economy found those subsidies would cost $42.6 billion next year, an increase of nearly $10 billion over this year.

The enrollment numbers do not include 12 health insurance marketplaces run by states and Washington, D.C. independently of the federal government.

The new demand could help improve profitability for insurers, said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. ""If the current (Affordable Care Act) open enrollment period is successful and enrollment grows, it means the insurance market is not collapsing,"" he said via Twitter.

""Because of the extraordinary demand, we extended the deadline to sign-up for January 1 coverage by two business days until 11:59 pm PST December 19. We don't yet know how many people will take advantage of this extension, but nearly a million consumers left their contact information to hold their place in line,"" HHS said in a statement.

Obama on Friday took a shot at critics who said the law would hurt business and employment by requiring larger employers to cover their workers.

""Since I signed Obamacare into law, our businesses have added more than 15 million new jobs,"" he said."	0

38	"A woman who knows first-hand the brutality of ISIS testified before Congress not too long ago, and she had some pretty damning words for outgoing President Obama.

ÃÂThe USA must act. We must terminate DAESH [Islamic State] and all such terror,ÃÂ former ISIS sex slave Nadia Murad said through a translator.


Murad, who escaped captivity in 2014, also spoke out on the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando that killed 49 Americans. She said she wasnÃÂt surprised.

ÃÂI knew if ISIS were not stopped, they would spread their crimes everywhere.ÃÂ

And just like a cancer that continues to metastasize and slowly eat away at a personÃÂs insides, her self-fulfilling prophecy has come true in more ways than one.

Obama is just like an inept doctor in that regard, and Murad called him out on it:

ÃÂIf a country as strong as your country cannot protect its citizens in Orlando, or in Belgium or in France, how come a small minority like us can protect ourselves while we are in the heart of the land where radicals are?ÃÂ Murad said bravely.

Well, Ms. Murad, it might have something to do with the fact we are knee-deep in the bull pen called political correctness. ObamaÃÂs decision not to call radical Islamic terrorism by its name and his choice to redact the original 9-1-1 transcript from the Pulse gunman bore witness to that fact back in June.

And where was the outrage after the Pulse massacre when the 2013 FBI investigation into the gunman was dropped due to concerns of Islamophobia? Where is the outrage now that 12 people in Berlin are dead and their families devastated? WhereÃÂs the outrage that Russia has responded appropriately while we are still sitting on our butts? DonÃÂt we realize President Obama could have prevented all of this a long time ago?

IÃÂll bet Nadia Murad does. Our president should have lost his right to govern for not responding effectively to this threat. He and his liberal brethren just call people on the other side of the aisle ÃÂracistÃÂ and allow the bodies to continue to pile up due to their inept leadership.

39	"The battle over President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general nominee, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, is heating up ahead of what promises to be a deeply contested confirmation hearing next year.

Groups on the left are ratcheting up their criticism of Sessions on issues such as immigration, criminal justice and voting rights while those supporting him are unveiling the first component of what is expected to be a vigorous campaign in his favor. His confirmation hearings are scheduled for January 10 and 11 before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The conservative Judicial Crisis Network on Thursday launched a website, ConfirmSessions, accompanied by a six-figure ad-buy touting the Alabama senator as someone who will enforce the law.

The digital ads, targeting the Washington, D.C. market, show clips of Trump praising Sessions and highlighting his experience as U.S. attorney in Alabama and then senator of the southern state.

""From his time as U.S. Attorney to his tenure as attorney general for the state of Alabama, Jeff Sessions successfully prosecuted drug and violent criminals, corrupt politicians and white collar offenders and his record shows an absolute commitment to equal justice under law by putting the people first ÃÂ not powerful special interests,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network.

Related: Trump Taps Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for Attorney General Post

Now the battle lines are being drawn over his nomination.

Sessions has a controversial past on issues of race and immigration, including his failed confirmation of a federal judgeship 30 years ago largely because of racially insensitive remarks.

In the 1980s, Sessions was considered for a Ronald Reagan-appointed federal district judgeship in Alabama, but was blocked by the Senate after a black former deputy, Thomas Figures, accused him of making racially insensitive statements. Figures said that Sessions called him ""boy"" and had once warned him to be careful about what he said to ""white folks."" Sessions denied the remarks under oath at the time. In addition, U.S. Attorney E.T. Rolison and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ginny Grenade - two people Figures said were in the room at the time of the alleged remarks -- signed affidavits saying they did not hear Sessions call Figures ""boy."" Grenade signed the affidavit in 1986 and Rolison signed one on December 8 of 2016.

Figures, a former assistant U.S. Attorney in Alabama, also testified that, during a 1981 murder investigation tied to the Ku Klux Klan, Sessions commented that he ""used to think they [the KKK] were OK"" until he found out some were ""pot smokers."" Sessions claimed he had been joking.

Now, progressives are pouncing.

The progressive group People for the American Way has drawn attention to missing information that Sessions failed to include in a vast questionnaire that he is required to fill out ahead of his confirmation hearings.

In a 10-page memo that outlines Sessions' omissions, PFAW notes that in response to questions about his public statements, Sessions listed 48 opinion articles that he wrote. But the group found 43 more. He also didn't include any of the 60 press releases from 2003 and 2004, including one on the Federal Marriage Amendment, according to the group. Nor did Sessions make mention of his failed nomination to be a federal judge from 20 years ago.

""Sessions' questionnaire is grossly incomplete ÃÂ we've found hundreds of relevant missing documents in just a few days,"" said Marge Baker, executive vice president of People for the American Way. ""It's ridiculous to think that the Senate could possibly give thorough consideration to a nominee with this many holes in his questionnaire.""

In response, Sessions submitted two additional pages of information on Thursday, including the listing of his judicial nomination.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the incoming ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is urging Republicans to delay the confirmation hearing.

In a letter to the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Feinstein suggested that a delay of the hearings might be necessary for two reasons: Sessions' incomplete questionnaire and the reams of information that the committee must investigate in less than a month. She noted that Sessions has more than 30 years of public service and public statements that must be analyzed, and the 150,000 pages of information he handed over, while not a complete accounting, is too much to assess before January 10.

""Staff must have sufficient time to do the due diligence on any nominee for this vital position ÃÂ and this due diligence will likely take longer than the review for recent, prior nominees who had less materials to analyze,"" Feinstein wrote.

Drew Courtney, communications director for PFAW, said: ""No matter who the nominee is, the confirmation process for an attorney general needs to be taken seriously; Given Donald Trump's dismissive attitude towards the Constitution, that's doubly true this year. Senator Grassley is doing the country a real disservice by trying to rush the process.""

But Sen. Grassley has indicated that he has no intention of postponing the hearings. ""It is no surprise that Senator Sessions' twenty years of service as our colleagueÃÂnot to mention his service in the Department of Justice and to the State of AlabamaÃÂyielded an extensive record,"" Grassley wrote in a letter responding to Feinstein.

Severino defended Sessions in a statement. ""Senator Sessions has turned over more material than any nominee in history and is well known to the senators. Liberals are scrambling to delay because they don't want an attorney general who puts the American people and the rule of law ahead of political agendas,"" Severino said.

This first battle is likely a sign of more conflicts to come over Sessions' nomination as the hearings approach."	0

43	"A writer for the NY Daily News argued Tuesday that ÃÂjustice was servedÃÂ following the assassination of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov.
According to Gersh Kuntzman, the murder of Karlov at the hands of a Turkish police officer shouting, ÃÂAllahu akbar,ÃÂ and, ÃÂDonÃÂt forget Aleppo,ÃÂ was not terrorism, but instead a noble act.
ÃÂAs Vladimir PutinÃÂs man in Turkey, Karlov was the public face of that murderous dictatorÃÂs war crimes around the globe and of oppression at home,ÃÂ Kuntzman claims. ÃÂAndrei Karlov is the human embodiment of policies that deployed bunker busters to kill babies, sent fighter planes on scorched earth bombing runs that destroyed a whole city, aided Syrian madman Bashar al-Assad in his campaign that has killed hundreds of thousands, and even ordered attacks on UN aid workers.ÃÂ
Kuntzman, who was ÃÂsurprised his murder didnÃÂt come months ago,ÃÂ attempted to draw comparisons to the 1938 assassination of Ernst vom Rath, the Nazi ambassador to France.
ÃÂLike Karlov, Rath was the public face of atrocity ÃÂ in this case, Adolf HitlerÃÂs genocide, anti-Semitism and coming global aggression,ÃÂ Kuntzman wrote, comparing RussiaÃÂs role in Syria to HitlerÃÂs across multiple continents.
After receiving backlash for the controversial piece, Kuntzman further defended his position on social media, arguing that Karlov was a soldier ÃÂ therefore shooting him in the back outside of a warzone was an appropriate move."	1
44	"If Rex Tillerson is nominated as the next secretary of state, it would confirm Vladimir Putin as one of the strategic victors of the US presidential election.

Barack Obama has ordered an inquiry into covert Russian intervention in the campaign, which the CIA says was designed to secure a victory for Donald Trump. But whether or not Russian intervention made a significant difference to the outcome, a Tillerson appointment would represent a significant gain for Moscow.

While the other leading candidates for the job hold largely traditional and adversarial views on Russia, the outgoing chief executive of Exxon Mobil has a history of close business ties to Putin, who bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson in 2013.

The Wall Street Journal reported: ÃÂFriends and associates said few US citizens are closer to Mr Putin than Mr Tillerson.ÃÂ

The 64-year-old Texas oilman spent much of his career working on Russian deals, including a 2011 agreement giving Exxon Mobil access to the huge resources under the Russian Arctic in return for giving the giant state-owned Russian oil company, OAO Rosneft, the opportunity to invest in Exxon MobilÃÂs operations overseas.

Tillerson is also friends with the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, a former interpreter who worked as chief of staff for Putin when he was deputy mayor in St Petersburg in the mid-1990s. Sechin, sometimes described as the second-most-powerful man in Russia, is now under US sanctions. He has said that one of his ambitions is to ÃÂride the roads in the United States on motorcycles with TillersonÃÂ.

The 2011 Exxon-Rosneft agreement was frozen when sanctions were imposed on Russia in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Exxon Mobil estimated the sanctions cost it $1bn and Tillerson has argued strenuously for the measures to be lifted.

TrumpÃÂs choice suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it
Thomas Wright, Brookings Institution
ÃÂWe always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions,ÃÂ he said, at a shareholdersÃÂ meeting.

In June, two years after sanctions were imposed and in an apparent show of support for Sechin, Tillerson reportedly turned up at a St Petersburg economic summit.

If the sanctions were lifted, the Arctic project would probably go ahead and TillersonÃÂs retirement fund of Exxon Mobil stock would increase in value. He would most likely have to divest himself of stock by the time he entered the office on the seventh floor of the state department. It might be harder to divorce his judgments entirely from the oil company where he spent his career.

ÃÂTrumpÃÂs choice of Rex Tillerson suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it,ÃÂ said Thomas Wright, who has written extensively on TrumpÃÂs foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.


ÃÂTillerson has a relationship with Putin and he opposed the sanctions imposed on Russia after the annexation of Crimea. This will alarm those worried about Russian intentions in Europe.ÃÂ

Praising Tillerson in an interview with Fox News Sunday, Trump said: ÃÂTo me a great advantage is that he knows many of the players in the world and he knows them well.ÃÂ

Lest there be any doubt about which players the president-elect had in mind, Trump added: ÃÂHe does massive deals in Russia not for himself, but for the company.ÃÂ

ÃÂA culture of intimidationÃÂ

In a very real sense, Tillerson has been a head of a state within a state. Exxon Mobil is bigger economically than many countries. It has its own foreign policy and its own contracted security forces.

As a state, it has much in common with the one run by Putin and Sechin.

ÃÂReporting on Exxon was not only harder than reporting on the Bin Ladens, it was harder than reporting on the CIA by an order of magnitude,ÃÂ said Steve Coll, who wrote about the company in a book, Private Empire.

ÃÂThey have a culture of intimidation that they bring to bear in their external relations, and it is plenty understood inside the corporation too. They make people nervous, they make people afraid,ÃÂ Coll, now a journalism professor at Columbia University, told Texas Monthly.

Running the state department would not be like running Exxon Mobil, however. For a start, Tillerson would have to audition in front of a sceptical Senate. On Saturday, leading Democrats were painting him as a Moscow stooge.

The New Jersey senator Bob Menendez said on Twitter: ÃÂRex Tillerson as secretary of state would guarantee Russia has a willing accomplice in the presidentÃÂs cabinet.ÃÂ

With a slim 52-48 majority, it would only take three Republican senators in revolt to cast TillersonÃÂs job in doubt. He would face aggressive questioning from Republican foreign policy hawks, led by John McCain.

ÃÂI have obviously concerns about his relationship with Vladimir Putin, who is a thug and a murderer, but obviously we will have hearings on that issue and other issues concerning him will be examined and then itÃÂs the time to make up your mind on whether to vote yes or no,ÃÂ the Arizona senator told CNN on Saturday.

A US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values would be a disaster for Russia
Andrei Kozyrev, former Russian foreign minister
McCainÃÂs former chief of staff, Mark Salter, was far more blunt on Twitter. ÃÂTillerson would sell out Nato for Sakhalin oil and his pal, Vlad,ÃÂ he wrote. ÃÂShould be a rough confirmation hearing, and a no vote on the Senate floor.ÃÂ

Even if Tillerson were to be confirmed, he would not take over the state department with a free hand to rewrite policy. He would face a striking culture clash with the institution, the bastion of foreign policy orthodoxy, which would have an ally in the secretary of defence nominee, retired general James Mattis, who is likely to oppose any erosion of Nato solidarity in the face of MoscowÃÂs assertiveness in Europe.

Nevertheless, Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Endowment Moscow Center, argued: ÃÂTillerson as secretary of state would signify the greatest discontinuity in US foreign policy since the end of the cold war.

ÃÂNot just in US-Russian relations: a Trump-Tillerson foreign policy would be squarely focused on US national interests, rather than on its global pretensions or any ideology.ÃÂ

Trenin added: ÃÂIt would be hard-nosed and no-nonsense, not averse to the use of force, but in response to a real rather than imaginary threat. In one word: realist.ÃÂ

That is a change that would be undoubtedly be welcomed by Putin, whose vision of foreign policy centres on spheres of interest controlled by global powers, run by strongmen like himself.

Andrei Kozyrev, a former Russian foreign minister, argued that the Kremlin should be careful what it wishes for.

ÃÂThe paradoxical situation now is that Russia is hoping for a US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values, but that would be a disaster for Russia,ÃÂ said Kozyrev, who is now at the Wilson Center thinktank in Washington.

ÃÂWhy? Because the only interest America has in ending the conflicts in eastern Ukraine ÃÂ or in Syria is actually in American values ÃÂ that America should be concerned and do everything to alleviate the humanitarian situation and they should help nations to find their path to democracy.

ÃÂThe realpolitik situation is that Russia is stuck in both military conflicts. If you look at this with a cold eye, you say: ÃÂLet them go on and let them enjoy the disaster they have in eastern Ukraine,ÃÂÃÂ Kozyrev said.

ÃÂLook at Syria. By realpolitik the Americans would rather sit and wait while Russia draws on its resources and gets into bloody conflict.ÃÂ"	0

46	"Like any number of us raised in the late 20th century, I have spent my life perplexed about exactly how Hitler could have come to power in Germany. Watching Donald TrumpÃÂs rise, I now understand. Leave aside whether a direct comparison of Trump to Hitler is accurate. That is not my point. My point rather is about how a demagogic opportunist can exploit a divided country.

To understand the rise of Hitler and the spread of Nazism, I have generally relied on the German-Jewish ÃÂ©migrÃÂ© philosopher Hannah Arendt and her arguments about the banality of evil. Somehow people can understand themselves as ÃÂjust doing their job,ÃÂ yet act as cogs in the wheel of a murderous machine. Arendt also offered a second answer in a small but powerful book called ÃÂMen in Dark Times.ÃÂ In this book, she described all those who thought that HitlerÃÂs rise was a terrible thing but chose ÃÂinternal exile,ÃÂ or staying invisible and out of the way as their strategy for coping with the situation. They knew evil was evil, but they too facilitated it, by departing from the battlefield out of a sense of hopelessness.

One can see both of these phenomena unfolding now. The first shows itself, for instance, when journalists cover every crude and cruel thing that comes out of TrumpÃÂs mouth and thereby help acculturate all of us to what we are hearing. Are they not just doing their jobs, they will ask, in covering the Republican front-runner? Have we not already been acculturated by 30 years of popular culture to offensive and inciting comments? Yes, both of these things are true. But that doesnÃÂt mean journalists ought to be TrumpÃÂs megaphone. Perhaps we should just shut the lights out on offensiveness; turn off the mic when someone tries to shout down others; reestablish standards for what counts as a worthwhile contribution to the public debate. That will seem counter to journalistic norms, yes, but why not let Trump pay for his own ads when he wants to broadcast foul and incendiary ideas? HeÃÂll still have plenty of access to freedom of expression. It is time to draw a bright line.

One spots the second experience in any number of water-cooler conversations or dinner-party dialogues. ÃÂYes, yes, it is terrible. Can you believe it? Have you seen anything like it? Has America come to this?ÃÂ ÃÂAgreed, agreed.ÃÂ But when someone asks what is to be done, silence falls. Very many of us, too many of us, are starting to contemplate accepting internal exile. Or we joke about moving to Canada more seriously than usually.

But over the course of the past few months, IÃÂve learned something else that goes beyond ArendtÃÂs ideas about the banality of evil and feelings of impotence in the face of danger.

Trump is rising by taking advantage of a divided country. The truth is that the vast majority of voting Americans think that Trump is unacceptable as a presidential candidate, but we are split by strong partisan ideologies and cannot coordinate a solution to stop him. Similarly, a significant part of voting Republicans think that Trump is unacceptable, but they too, thus far, have been unable to coordinate a solution. Trump is exploiting the fact that we cannot unite across our ideological divides.

The only way to stop him, then, is to achieve just that kind of coordination across party lines and across divisions within parties. We have reached that moment of truth.

Republicans, you cannot count on the Democrats to stop Trump. I believe that Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination, and I intend to vote for her, but it is also the case that she is a candidate with significant weaknesses, as your party knows quite well. The result of a head-to-head contest between Clinton and Trump would be unpredictable. Trump has to be blocked in your primary.

Jeb Bush has done the right thing by dropping out, just as he did the right thing by being the first, alongside Rand Paul, to challenge Trump. The time has come, John Kasich and Ben Carson, to leave the race as well. You both express a powerful commitment to the good of your country and to its founding ideals. If you care about the future of this republic, it is time to endorse Marco Rubio. Kasich, thereÃÂs a little wind in your sails, but itÃÂs not enough. Your country is calling you. Do the right thing.

Ted Cruz is, I believe, pulling votes away from Trump, and for that reason is useful in the race. But, Mr. Cruz, you are drawing too close to TrumpÃÂs politics. You too should change course.

Democrats, your leading candidate is too weak to count on as a firewall. She might be able to pull off a general election victory against Trump, but then again she might not. Too much is uncertain this year. You, too, need to help the Republicans beat Trump; this is no moment for standing by passively. If your deadline for changing your party affiliation has not yet come, re-register and vote for Rubio, even if, like me, you cannot stomach his opposition to marriage equality. I too would prefer Kasich as the Republican nominee, but pursuing that goal will only make it more likely that Trump takes the nomination. The republic cannot afford that.

Finally, to all of you Republicans who have already dropped out, one more, great act of public service awaits you. As candidates, you pledged to support whomever the Republican party nominated. ItÃÂs time to revoke your pledge. Be bold, stand up and shout that you will not support Trump if he is your partyÃÂs nominee. Do it together. Hold one big mother of a news conference. Endorse Rubio, together. It is time to draw a bright line, and you are the ones on whom this burden falls. No one else can do it.

Marco Rubio, this is also your moment to draw a bright line. You too ought to rescind your pledge to support the partyÃÂs nominee if it is Trump.

Donald Trump has no respect for the basic rights that are the foundation of constitutional democracy, nor for the requirements of decency necessary to sustain democratic citizenship. Nor can any democracy survive without an expectation that the people require reasonable arguments that bring the truth to light, and Trump has nothing but contempt for our intelligence.

We, the people, need to find somewhere, buried in the recesses of our fading memories, the capacity to make common cause against this formidable threat to our equally shared liberties. The time is now."	0

President-elect Donald Trump plans to dissolve his foundation, his transition team announced on in statement on Saturday.

Soon after, though, the New York attorney general's spokesperson tweeted that he legally can't, until the state's investigation of the Trump Foundation is complete.

.@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Foundation still under investigation by @AGSchneiderman, cannot legally dissolve until investigation complete
ÃÂ Amy Spitalnick (@amyspitalnick) December 24, 2016
Press Secretary Amy Spitalnick was responding to Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold, who asked if the investigation would continue.

In October, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop raising money in New York, saying the charity was not registered to do so under state law.

In Saturday's statement, Trump is quoted as saying:

""The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children. However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.""
The announcement comes shortly after a report from The New York Times discussing the president-elect's many potential conflicts of interest. The Times reports that Trump and his family ""are rushing to resolve potential controversies ÃÂ like shuttering foundations and terminating development deals ÃÂ even as the president-elect publicly maintains that no legal conflicts exist.""

An NPR report from earlier this year compared the work of the Trump Foundation with that of the Clinton Foundation, which came under fire during the campaign, noting the similarities seem to end with their names. As NPR's Joel Rose reported, ""The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, as it's formally known, is huge. It has hundreds of employees and a $90 million budget. The Donald J. Trump Foundation, by contrast, is fairly small. It has no full-time employees and a budget of about $600,000.""

In an interview with NPR's Allison Aubrey Sunday, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold provided context.

""The Donald J. Trump Foundation has been around since the late '80s, and on paper it sort of looks like what a lot of other rich people have, which is a foundation that's set up to give Trump's money away. But it's actually not that at all ÃÂ for many of the recent years between 2009 and 2015, it didn't actually get any money from Trump at all ÃÂ instead he gave away other people's money kind of under his own name, to people that thought they were getting Trump's money. He also used it to apparently violate the law in a number of ways ÃÂ he used it to buy big portraits of himself including one that hangs on the wall of a sports bar he owns, and he used it to pay off debts or obligations that his businesses have incurred. So he was already under investigation by the New York Attorney General for apparently violating a number of federal laws that govern charities.""
David Fahrenthold's reporting in the Post has shown that Trump hasn't given any of his own money to the foundation since 2008. The Post says Vince and Linda McMahon, owners of World Wrestling Entertainment, have been major donors; Trump recently nominated Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration."	0

49	"AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas has given Planned Parenthood final notice of plans to cut off Medicaid funding, a move that federal judges have so far blocked other Republican-controlled states from making. 

Planned Parenthood responded Tuesday by saying it will also ask a court to stop Texas from defunding clinics in January. Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana and Kansas are among the states where judges have denied similar efforts.

People are donating to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence's name
Planned Parenthood had previously received $3.1 million in Medicaid funding from the state of Texas, according to the notice that was obtained by the Texas Tribune. Planned Parenthood says its clinics serve nearly 11,000 women in Texas each year through Medicaid. 

Planned Parenthood will lose the Medicaid funding within 30 days. The organization has 15 days to appeal  by requesting an administrative hearing with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, according to the Tribune. 

Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards responded by calling Texas ÃÂa cautionary tale for the rest of the nation.ÃÂ The move comes at a time when her organization is simultaneously fighting to stop Congress from also cutting off taxpayer dollars. President-elect Donald Trump has given mixed signals about his feelings toward the group.

Last week, the Obama administration barred states from denying federal family planning funds, although abortion opponents immediately said they would seek to repeal it when Mr. Trump takes office in January. "	0
50	"GARDINER, MTÃÂFending off the large wildcat moments before it could harm her best friend, presidential pet Sunny reportedly saved fellow first dog Bo from a mountain lion attack last month as they journeyed across the country to find their way back to the Obama family.

Sources said the White HouseÃÂs two canine residents, who were accidentally left behind by the first family during a trip to Yellowstone National Park, encountered the mountain lion while making their way through the Montana wilderness. According to reports, Bo, who had become separated from his companion earlier in the day when he slid into a ravine, was cornered by the predator against a large tree trunk and seemed to have no means of escape until Sunny, having seemingly appeared out of nowhere, came rushing to his aid at the last possible second.

ÃÂBo, get out of the way!ÃÂ said Sunny, her teeth bared and her fur bristling as she lunged toward the menacing cougar, ultimately scaring it back into the forest. ÃÂThatÃÂs right! Run away, you coward! NobodyÃÂs going to hurt my friend while IÃÂm around!ÃÂ

ÃÂDonÃÂt worry, Bo,ÃÂ she added. ÃÂYouÃÂre safe now.ÃÂ

Administration officials said the two Portuguese water dogs were mistakenly left in Yellowstone by the vacationing Obamas, who returned home believing Sunny and Bo had been loaded aboard Air Force One, never realizing the pair had scampered off the tarmac and into the woods moments before takeoff to chase a squirrel. It is believed that the dogs later returned to the spot where they had last scented Barack, Michelle, Malia, and Sasha Obama and, after sitting patiently overnight until realizing the family was not going to return, decided to find their way back to Washington, D.C. on their own, beginning a 2,000-mile journey eastward.

The first pets reportedly spent the next few days bounding over mountain passes and wading through rocky streams, from which Bo would, after several fruitless attempts, emerge with a fish in his mouth, providing much-needed sustenance to the pair, who were accustomed to being fed nutritious meals at regular intervals by their White House handlers. Early on in their trek, Sunny and Bo are said to have encountered several hikers they thought might rescue them. However, the group turned out to be German tourists who, reportedly failing to recognize the presidential seal on the dogsÃÂ collars, simply pet them, fed them some dried fruit, and continued on their way.

ÃÂWhat do you think theyÃÂre eating at the state dinner tonight?ÃÂ Bo asked a tired, disinterested Sunny as the two crouched inside a hollow tree trunk where they had been forced to take shelter during a particularly fierce storm. ÃÂI bet theyÃÂre having steak. Oh, man, I can almost taste it now. ThatÃÂs my absolute favorite. Do you think Malia is saving her leftovers for me? I bet she is.ÃÂ

ÃÂI miss Washington,ÃÂ Bo continued. ÃÂWeÃÂll be back home soon, though, right?ÃÂ

According to sources, rarely a day of their adventure went by without the two dogs getting into a precarious situation that required them to rely on each other to get through. At one point, after traveling for a day without water, Sunny reportedly came upon a rushing river and, in her eagerness to take a drink, slipped on a rock, fell in, and was swept away by the powerful current. Bo is believed to have reached the riverÃÂs edge just in time to see SunnyÃÂs head pop up and disappear around the bend. With neither dog having much swimming experience outside the White House pool, sources said a quick-thinking Bo ran downstream as fast as he could, grabbed one end of a long stick in his jaws, extended it out over the water, had Sunny bite down on the other end, and managed to pull her to safety just before she would have plunged over a waterfall.

Several weeks later, sources reported that a curious Bo followed an unusual scent into a hollow log lying on its side in the Black Hills, only to come scrambling out moments later pursued by a slowly ambling porcupine. Bo is said to have spent the rest of the evening whimpering as Sunny carefully removed the quills stuck in her companionÃÂs muzzle using her teeth, at one point pausing to say, ÃÂYou have to go and stick your nose in everything, donÃÂt you?ÃÂ

Cold and hungry as they crossed through barren, wintry terrain, the first dogs were reportedly found trudging through chest-deep snow by a kindly old man who let them stay for a time in his small and humble cabin, surroundings that were far removed from the accommodations that Sunny, who was purchased from a professional breeder, and Bo, who was a gift from the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), were used to. According to reports, the old man allowed the pair to join his team of sled dogs, who initially bullied the White House pets for their pampered backgrounds.

ÃÂYou call yourselves dogs, do you?ÃÂ said Avalanche, a hulking husky and the lead dog on the old manÃÂs sled team. ÃÂSomething tells me youÃÂve had everything in life handed to you on a silver dog dish. That may be the way things work in Washington, D.C., but around here we have to earn our keep. This is no place for lapdogs.ÃÂ

Later, sources stated, Sunny and Bo earned the respect of that same dog when they worked together to save several members of the sled team who had fallen through a patch of thin ice during a routine supply run.

Unbeknownst to the pair as they made their way across the country, the Obamas were said to be desperately trying to locate the pets they missed so much. According to sources, Sasha and Malia Obama put up flyers all around the nationÃÂs capital and asked every congressman they encountered to keep an eye out for the dogs in their home districts. Reports indicate that Sasha also went to bed each night looking at an old photo of her beloved pets, promising aloud that they would all be reunited one day.

As the first dogs passed through the Midwest on their trek homeward, they reportedly came upon a small city where, much to their delight, they heard the unmistakable sound of their ownerÃÂs voice. Barking excitedly as they ran toward it, they are believed to have rounded a corner only to discover President Obama giving a speech on the screen of a television in an electronics store. Reports confirmed the pair, having caused quite a commotion, were then chased down the block by the townÃÂs dogcatcher, escaping only after Bo bit the man on the seat of his pants, causing him to yelp in pain and exposing his heart-patterned boxer shorts to passersby beneath the flap of torn fabric.

Some days later, Sunny and Bo appeared ready to give up, having convinced themselves they would never again sniff fresh tomatoes from Michelle ObamaÃÂs vegetable garden or receive one of Treasury Secretary Jack LewÃÂs signature belly rubs. Deciding they were simply too tired and demoralized to continue onward, the pair are said to have stopped to sleep for the night in the bed of a beat-up, old pickup truck. Sources said they were jarred awake in the morning when the engine roared to life and the pickup lurched out onto the highway.

After initially panicking when they realized they were being driven to an unknown destination, the two dogs reportedly soon found themselves enjoying the breeze rushing through their fur and the vast stretches of ground they were quickly covering. Several hours later, the dogs are said to have smelled something familiar, perking their heads up over the tailgate and then howling in delight when they saw trees filled with pink cherry blossoms growing denser around them.

ÃÂWait a second, I recognize those barks,ÃÂ said President Obama, interrupting his introduction of a judicial nominee at a Rose Garden press conference to discover the dogs bounding across the South Lawn toward him. ÃÂQuick, get Sasha and Malia! Oh, my goodness! Where on earth have you rascals been?ÃÂ

ÃÂEveryone get out here!ÃÂ he continued, embracing Sunny and Bo as they eagerly licked his face and the first family came running to welcome them home. ÃÂTheyÃÂre back!ÃÂ

At press time, Michelle Obama was reportedly rolling her eyes and saying ÃÂI guess everythingÃÂs back to normalÃÂ as the family sat down for their first meal together since their reunion and heard the unmistakable sound of Bo lapping water from an East Wing toilet."	0
51	"MOSCOW, Ru. ÃÂ During an extravagant ceremony at the Kremlin on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he has appointed American actor and martial arts expert Steven Seagal to serve as Tsar of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula that was annexed by the Russian Federation in March of 2014.

Dubbed ÃÂSteven the GreatÃÂ by Mr. Putin, the sixty-four year-old Under Siege star will take up residence at the Grand Livadia Palace in the coastal city of Yalta where he will hold power over nearly two million Crimeans. Featuring a breathtaking panoramic view of the Black Sea, the royal residence once served as a summer retreat for Nicholas II, the last tsar of Russia.

ÃÂThis is a momentous day, not just for the people of Crimea, but for all Russians,ÃÂ proclaimed Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev during an appearance on the state-run news network Russia Today. ÃÂSteven the Great is a legendary martial artist with an extensive background in firearms and marksmanship. Furthermore, he is more proficient and possesses far greater experience in hand-to-hand combat, counter-terrorism operations, and crime fighting than any man on earth excluding His Excellency President Putin.ÃÂ

The prime minister later said Putin has the utmost confidence in SeagalÃÂs ability to rule Crimea, calling the star of Hard to Kill a ÃÂfirm but gentle leaderÃÂ who is ÃÂwell versed in the art of paternalism.ÃÂ To drive the point home, Putin will hand over command of Russian forces in Crimea ÃÂ including the Black Sea Fleet based in Sevastopol ÃÂ to Mr. Seagal upon his arrival at Livadia Palace later this week.

52	WASHINGTONÃÂIn an effort to help voters make an informed decision at the polls, the Federal Election Commission announced Thursday it would be extending the U.S. presidential election by seven months to give Americans the opportunity to better get to know the presidential candidates. ÃÂWe believe the continuation of this election by just over half a year will provide Americans with the chance to fully acquaint themselves with both the character and policy positions of Secretary Clinton and Mr. Trump,ÃÂ said FEC chairman Matthew S. Petersen, who expressed confidence that the American people would benefit greatly from over 200 extra days of election coverage, rallies, press conferences, and campaign ads. ÃÂOur commission has also worked with the CPD to schedule eight more presidential debates and three more town halls, so that there will be no question that every citizen is ready to cast their ballot by the time Election Day comes around on June 8, 2017.ÃÂ The FEC added that it had not ruled out extending the election by an additional year if any U.S. voters were still undecided.	0
53	"Khizr Khan, the Muslim Gold Star father that the mainstream media and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have been using to criticize Donald J. Trump, has deep ties to the government of Saudi ArabiaÃÂand to international Islamist investors through his own law firm. In addition to those ties to the wealthy Islamist nation, Khan also has ties to controversial immigration programs that wealthy foreigners can use to essentially buy their way into the United StatesÃÂand has deep ties to the ÃÂClinton CashÃÂ narrative through the Clinton Foundation.
Khan and his wife Ghazala Khan both appeared on stage at the Democratic National Convention to attack, on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary ClintonÃÂs behalf, Donald TrumpÃÂthe Republican nominee for president. Their son, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, was killed in Iraq in 2004. Khizr Khan, in his speech to the DNC, lambasted Donald Trump for wanting to temporarily halt Islamic migration to America from countries with a proven history of exporting terrorists.

Since then, Clinton operative George StephanopoulosÃÂwho served as a senior adviser to the president in Bill ClintonÃÂs White House and is a Clinton Foundation donor as well as a host on the ABC networkÃÂpushed Trump on the matter in an interview. TrumpÃÂs comments in that interview have sparked the same mini-rebellion inside his party, in the media and across the aisle that has happened many times before. The usual suspects inside the GOP, from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to House Speaker Paul Ryan to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, have condemned Trump in one way or another. The media condemnation has been swift and Democrats, as well their friends throughout media, are driving the train as fast as they can.

But until now, it looked like the Khans were just Gold Star parents who the big bad Donald Trump attacked. It turns out, however, in addition to being Gold Star parents, the Khans are financially and legally tied deeply to the industry of Muslim migrationÃÂand to the government of Saudi Arabia and to the Clintons themselves.

Khan, according to Intelius as also reported by Walid Shoebat, used to work at the law firm Hogan Lovells, LLP, a major D.C. law firm that has been on retainer as the law firm representing the government of Saudi Arabia in the United States for years. Citing federal government disclosure forms, the Washington Free Beacon reported the connection between Saudi Arabia and Hogan Lovells a couple weeks ago.

ÃÂHogan Lovells LLP, another U.S. firm hired by the Saudis, is registered to work for the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia through 2016, disclosures show,ÃÂ Joe Schoffstall of the Free Beacon reported.

The federal form filed with the Department of Justice is a requirement under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, which makes lobbyists and lawyers working on behalf of foreign governments and other agents from abroad with interests in the United States register with the federal government.

The government of Saudi Arabia, of course, has donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation.

ÃÂThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has given between $10 and $25 million to the foundation while Friends of Saudi Arabia has contributed between $1 and $5 million,ÃÂ Schoffstall wrote.

Trump, of course, has called on Hillary Clinton to have the Clinton Foundation return the money.

ÃÂSaudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation want women as slaves and to kill gays,ÃÂ Trump wrote in a Facebook post back in June, according to Politico. ÃÂHillary must return all money from such countries!ÃÂ

ÃÂCrooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate,ÃÂ Trump posted in a separate Facebook posting at the time. ÃÂI am calling on her to immediately return the $25 million plus she got from them for the Clinton Foundation!ÃÂ

Of course, to this day, Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has kept the money from the Saudi Arabian government.

SchoffstallÃÂs piece in the Washington Free Beacon also notes how Hogan Lovells lobbyist Robert Kyle, per Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, has bundled more than $50,000 in donations for ClintonÃÂs campaign this year.

KhanÃÂs connections with the Hogan Lovells firm run deep, according to a report from Law.com written by Katelyn Polantz.

ÃÂMany lawyers at Hogan Lovells remember the week in 2004 when U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan lost his life to a suicide bomber,ÃÂ Polantz wrote. ÃÂThen-Hogan & Hartson attorneys mourned the death because the soldierÃÂs father, Khizr Khan, a Muslim American immigrant, was among their beloved colleagues.ÃÂ

Polantz wrote that Khan worked at the mega-D.C. law firm for years.

ÃÂKhan spent seven years, from 2000 to 2007, in the Washington, D.C., office of then-Hogan & Hartson,ÃÂ Polantz wrote. ÃÂHe served as the firmÃÂs manager of litigation technology. Although he did not practice law while at Hogan, Khan was well versed in understanding the American courts system. On Thursday night, he described his late son dreaming of becoming a military lawyer.ÃÂ

But representing the Clinton Foundation backing Saudi Arabian government and having one of its lobbyists bundle $50,000-plus for ClintonÃÂs campaign are hardly the only places where the Khan-connected Hogan Lovells D.C. mega-firm brush elbows with Clinton Cash. 

The firm also handles Hillary ClintonÃÂs taxes and is deeply connected with the email scandal whereby when she was Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton set up a home-brew email server system that jeopardized classified information handling and was ÃÂextremely carelessÃÂ according to FBI director James Comey.

ÃÂA lawyer at Hogan & Hartson [Howard Topaz] has been Bill and Hillary ClintonÃÂs go-to guy for tax advice since 2004, according to documents released Friday by Hillary ClintonÃÂs campaign,ÃÂ The American LawyerÃÂs Nate Raymond wrote in 2008, as Hillary Clinton ran for president that year. ÃÂThe ClintonsÃÂ tax returns for 2000-07 show combined earnings of $109 million, on which they paid $33 million in taxes. New York-based tax partner Howard Topaz has a broad tax practice, and also regularly advises corporations on M&A and executive compensation.ÃÂ

Breitbart NewsÃÂ Patrick Howley, in a deep investigative piece on Hillary ClintonÃÂs email scandal, late last year uncovered how TopazÃÂs firmÃÂwhich employed Khan while Topaz did Hillary ClintonÃÂs taxesÃÂis also connected to the email scandal.

ÃÂTopaz was a partner at Hogan & Hartson, which later merged to become known as Hogan Lovells, where Topaz continues to practice. The firmÃÂs lawyers were major donors to Hillary ClintonÃÂs first presidential campaign,ÃÂ Howley wrote.

For her private email system, Clinton used a spam filtering program MX Logic.

ÃÂHogan & Hartson handled the patent for MX LogicÃÂs email-filtering program, which McAfee bought the small company for $140 million in 2009 in order to acquire,ÃÂ Howley wrote. ÃÂThe MX Logic companyÃÂs application for a trademark for its SPAMTRAQ program was filed in 2004 on Hogan & Hartson stationery and signed by a Hogan & Hartson attorney. Hogan & Hartson has been responsible for MX Logic annual reports. The email companyÃÂs Clinton links present more evidence that ClintonÃÂs political and legal establishment was monitoring her private email use.ÃÂ

If that all isnÃÂt enough, that same Hogan & Hartson law firmÃÂnow Hogan LovellsÃÂemployed Loretta Lynch, the current Attorney General of the United States. Lynch infamously just a few weeks ago met with Bill Clinton, HillaryÃÂs husband and the former president, on her private jet in Phoenix just before clearing Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing when it came to her illicit private email server system.

KhanÃÂs own website for his own personal law firm KM Khan Law Office shows he represents clients in the business of buying visas to enter the United States. One of his specific areas of practice, according to the website, is ÃÂE2 Treaty Investors, EB5 Investments & Related Immigration Services.ÃÂ

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the U.S. SenateÃÂs Judiciary Committee, has detailed how the EB5 immigration program is ÃÂriddled with flaws and corruption.ÃÂ

ÃÂMaybe it is only here on Capitol HillÃÂon this island surrounded by realityÃÂthat we can choose to plug our ears and refuse to listen to commonly accepted facts,ÃÂ Grassley said in a statement earlier this year. ÃÂThe Government Accountability Office, the media, industry experts, members of congress, and federal agency officials, have concurred that the program is a serious problem with serious vulnerabilities. Allow me to mention a few of the flaws.ÃÂ

From there, Sen. Grassley listed out several of the ÃÂflawsÃÂ with the EB5 immigration program that Khan works in:

ÃÂ Investments can be spent before business plans are approved. 

ÃÂ Regional Center operators can charge exorbitant fees of foreign nationals in addition to their required investments.  

ÃÂ Jobs created are not ÃÂdirectÃÂ or verifiable jobs but rather are ÃÂindirectÃÂ and based on estimates and economic modeling.

ÃÂ Jobs created by U.S. investors are counted by the foreign national when obtaining a green card, even if EB-5 money is only a fraction of the total invested.

ÃÂ Investment funds are not adequately vetted. 

ÃÂ Gifts and loans are acceptable sources of funds from foreign nationals.

ÃÂ The investment level has been stagnant for nearly 25 years.

ÃÂ ThereÃÂs no prohibition against foreign governments owning or operating regional centers or projects.

ÃÂ Regional centers can be rented or sold without government oversight or approval.

ÃÂ Regional centers donÃÂt have to certify that they comply with securities laws.  

ÃÂ ThereÃÂs no oversight of promoters who work overseas for the regional centers.

ÃÂ ThereÃÂs no set of sanctions for violations, no recourse for bad actors.

ÃÂ There are no required background checks on anyone associated with a regional center.

ÃÂ Regional centers draw Targeted Employment Area boundaries around poor areas in order to come in at a lower investment level, yet the jobs created are not actually created in those areas.

ÃÂ Every Targeted Employment Area designation is rubberstamped by the agency.

ÃÂ Adjudicators are pressured to get to a yes, especially for those politically connected. 

ÃÂ Visas are not properly scrutinized. 

ÃÂ Visas are pushed through despite security warnings.

ÃÂ Files and applications lack basic and necessary information to monitor compliance.

ÃÂ The agency does not do site visits for each and every project.

ÃÂ ThereÃÂs no transparency on how funds are spent, who is paid, and what investors are told about the projects they invest in.

ThatÃÂs not to mention the fact that, according to Sen. Grassley, there have been serious national security violations in connection with the EB5 program that Khan works in and around already. In fact, the programÃÂaccording to GrassleyÃÂwas used by Middle Eastern operatives from Iran to attempt to illicitly enter the United States.

ÃÂThere are also classified reports that detail the national security, fraud and abuse. Our committee has received numerous briefings and classified documents to show this side of the story,ÃÂ Grassley said in the early February 2016 statement. ÃÂThe enforcement arm of the Department of Homeland Security wrote an internal memo that raises significant concerns about the program. One section of the memo outlines concerns that it could be used by Iranian operatives to infiltrate the United States. The memo identifies seven main areas of program vulnerability, including the export of sensitive technology, economic espionage, use by foreign government agents and terrorists, investment fraud, illicit finance and money laundering.ÃÂ

Maybe all of this is whyÃÂas Breitbart News has previously notedÃÂthe Democratic National Convention made absolutely no mention of the Clinton Foundation or Clinton Global Initiative. Hillary ClintonÃÂs coronation ceremony spent exactly zero minutes of the four nights of official DNC programming talking about anything to do with perhaps one of the biggest parts of her biography.

55	"President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has asked the State Department to list its workers who focus on gender equality and ending violence against women, in what's being seen as an echo of an earlier request for the Energy Department to list employees who work on climate change.

In a brief email that was sent Wednesday morning, the Trump team asked the State Department's bureaus and offices to list any programs or activities that ""promote gender equality, such as ending gender-based violence, promoting women's participation in economic and political spheres, entrepreneurship, etc.""

The email was acquired and published by The New York Times, which reports:

""Although the wording of the memo is neutral and does not hint at any policy change, it rattled State Department employees, even those at senior levels. Some officials said they feared that the incoming Trump administration was trying to determine what programs were focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, though the memo did not refer to them.""
The team also asked the department offices to ""note positions whose primary functions are to promote such issues"" and to highlight any funds for the current financial year that are ""already allocated to such programs and activities.""

Affirming the Times' characterization of the email's reception, The Los Angeles Times quotes a senior State Department official who said, ""People are freaked out.""

Update 9 a.m. ET Friday: Trump Team's Response

In a statement about the request, the Trump transition team says:

""President-elect Trump will ensure the rights of women across the world are valued and protected. To help fulfill this promise, the transition team inquired about existing programs at the State department that helps foster gender equality, ends gender-based violence, and promotes economic and political participationÃÂfinding ways to improve them, along with hundreds of other requests.""
Our original post continues:

The topic also came up at Thursday's daily State Department briefing ÃÂ but NPR's Michele Kelemen says it seemed that spokesman John Kirby mainly sought to calm nerves about the request.

In a report for our Newscast unit, Michele quotes Kirby as saying, ""To the degree that there is interest in the way that we have approached pursuing gender equality and human rights around the world by the transition team, we will certainly provide them the context, the information that is appropriate for them to make their own decisions going forward.""

Kirby acknowledged that there could be ""anxiety"" at a time of transition, but he refused to go into details about the email or to verify the accuracy of the leaked documents.

Addressing his agency's approach to gender issues, Kirby told a reporter, ""Obviously, gender equality issues here at the Department of State are a priority. Secretary Kerry has made them a priority; Secretary Clinton before him made it a priority, and it remains one for us here.""

Kirby also suggested that the State Department might balk at naming its employees who have worked on those priorities, saying that in a hypothetical case, ""if there were issue-specific names requested, obviously that would be of concern to us and it would not be the kind of information that we would deem to be appropriate to be passed along.""

Shortly after the transition team's email became public, the Twitter account of the State Department's Political-Military Affairs bureau posted a note of support for the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, & Security ÃÂ a program that was celebrated in a State Department tweet Wednesday, as the agency marked five years since the plan was introduced by President Obama.

In response to reports about the memo, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement saying in part:

""In light of previous requests made by the Trump transition team, today's report that the incoming administration is requesting all information related to State Department programs that promote gender equality is concerning and the transition team should clarify their intent.... Women and girls' equality is transformative for communities and economies, and the existing State Department programs have achieved great successes to advance education access for girls, protect women from trafficking, end child marriage, and combat gender-based violence.""
The Trump team's request, which set a deadline of Wednesday afternoon to produce the lists, comes one week after the Energy Department rebuffed a request from Trump's transition team to name employees working on climate change.

As NPR's Brakkton Booker has reported, the Trump team's 74-point questionnaire on climate change ""raised fears among civil rights lawyers specializing in federal worker whistleblower protections, who say the incoming administration is at a minimum trying to influence or limit the research.""

In refusing the Trump team's request, the Energy Department said many of its staff members were ""unsettled"" by the gesture, stating that while it would share any information that was already public, it would not produce a list of individual names.

Early last week, Trump said he is nominating Exxon Mobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson to lead the State Department."	0

57	"MINNESOTA (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂPsychologists at the University of Minnesota have issued a research study recommending that people suffering from low self-esteem watch Thursday nightÃÂs nationally televised Republican debate.

The recommendation came after the psychologists spent weeks showing research subjects video clips of the debateÃÂs potential participants and observed striking improvements in the subjectsÃÂ overall morale and sense of worth.

ÃÂWe interviewed the volunteers before we exposed them to the Republican candidates and afterward,ÃÂ said psychologist Davis Logsdon. ÃÂThe spike in their self-esteem was off the charts.ÃÂ

Of the candidates who most improved the research subjectsÃÂ sense of self, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush were found to be consistently helpful, but the most marked increase in self-esteem levels came after the subjects were exposed to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.
According to the data, people who viewed Walker for approximately three minutes reported feeling better ÃÂright awayÃÂ about their intelligence, knowledge, and prospects for obtaining high-status employment that they had previously considered well beyond their reach.

ÃÂAfter watching Governor Walker, a substantial number of the subjects literally could not remember why they had ever felt bad about themselves,ÃÂ Logsdon said.

In addition to recommending that low self-esteem-sufferers watch the debate, Logsdon is advising them to D.V.R. the entire two hours. ÃÂYou never know when you might need it again,ÃÂ he said."	0

But What Happened Hillary?
We are all familiar with the countless leaks that performed catastrophic damage against the Democratic Party. But, in reality, all it did was show the lies, deceit, and corruption already taking place. Nothing that we saw is new, and it should be a bold wake-up call to anyone who believes what our government tells us without thought or question.

The #1 Reason For The DemocratÃÂs Historic Loss
When the dust settled, however, it was clear that the Democratic Party created a wave they never saw coming; they never expected the American People to rise up by the thousands to declare their disgust for the Washington status quo.

How did they create this wave? Their initial strategy elevated Trump. They intended to use Trump as a ÃÂPied PiperÃÂ candidate they would use to portray the Republican Party in a bad light. Their failed strategy was revealed in WikiLeak 1120.



Great job Hillary! Your attempt to put Conservatives in a bad light ended up backfiring big time. You didnÃÂt get to steal the Election. No, instead you awakened the ever-awake silent majority waiting to take back this great land.

59	"Escalating his attack on Mitt Romney and Bain Capital, President Obama charged yesterday that ÃÂRomney and Bain put profits ahead of losses.ÃÂ

Obama released two Bain Private Placement Memoranda (PPMs) prepared for investors during RomneyÃÂs tenure. Obama found the documents ÃÂdisturbingÃÂ and ÃÂmean-spirited.ÃÂ

ÃÂThey reveal that Romney and Bain employed the lure of profits to entice investors,ÃÂ Obama claimed. ÃÂTheir sole promise to investors was a good return on investment. In their pitch to investors, Bain completely ignored combating global warming, fighting childhood obesity, and helping homeowners with underwater mortgages.

ÃÂEven worse, Bain and Romney accepted only those investors willing to pay BainÃÂs asking price. Ability to pay was BainÃÂs sole criterion for accepting investors. Bain made no attempt to achieve ethnic, racial, gender, or sexual preference balance among their investors,ÃÂ Obama continued.

ÃÂBain was in business to make money,ÃÂ Obama declared. ÃÂTheir PPMs prove it. Bain and Romney were blinded by greed. Had they been willing to incur large losses, they could addressed issues that most concern hard-working middle class Americans, such as helping hard-working middle class Americans struggling to pay texting overcharges for their hard-working middle class children.

Obama contrasted his experience as a community organizer with RomneyÃÂs concern about profits. ÃÂI was trying to improve the lives of everyone in the community. The only time I focused on money was when our grants needed renewal.ÃÂ

Obama said working for a profit making organization is poor training for a president. ÃÂThe presidentÃÂs job is to finance deficits, not to maximize profits. Moreover, itÃÂs the presidentÃÂs job to assure that everybody in the country has a fair shot by providing government programs that donÃÂt work.

ÃÂApplying the private sectorÃÂs heartless logic of cost/benefit would decimate government programs,ÃÂ Obama stated. ÃÂFor example, federal job training programs would appear absurdly inefficient until you consider how virtuous these programs make us feel about our good intentions.ÃÂ"	0

62	"Trump refuses to disavow the Dark LordÃÂs support, stirring controversy

MORDOR ÃÂ Sauron, the fallen Maia best known for engulfing Middle-Earth in two apocalyptic wars, has endorsed real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump for president of the United States. This comes as to shock to those who thought that Sauron was destroyed at the end of the Third Age.

Though SauronÃÂs power greatly diminished after the destruction of The One Ring, a fragment of his broken spirit has endured for millennia, and still lurks beneath the ruins of Barad-dÃÂ»r (present-day Gadsden, Alabama). The Dark Lord is currently not powerful enough to assume a physical form, but still has the presence of mind to follow the Republican presidential primaries.

ÃÂDonald Trump is the only candidate who can fulfill my vision for the future,ÃÂ Sauron said Saturday night in an omnipresent, ethereal whisper. ÃÂJust as I spread darkness and suffering across Middle-Earth, so shall Trump bring darkness to Middle America.ÃÂ

In many ways, Trump is a natural choice for Sauron. During his tenure as the Dark Lord of Mordor, Sauron enacted or supported numerous controversial policies, including the expansion of torture, the murder of Rohirrim families, and the deportation of 12 million dwarves.

When asked about Sauron on NBCÃÂs Meet the Press, Trump seemed hesitant to distance himself from the evil necromancer. ÃÂI donÃÂt think the American people want me to dismiss every Dark Lord before I have a chance to learn more about them,ÃÂ said Trump. ÃÂI just donÃÂt know anything about Sauron or his dark legion of orcs, trolls, and NazgÃÂ»l; I need to do more research.ÃÂ

TrumpÃÂs refusal to disavow SauronÃÂs support has sparked huge backlash from pundits and fellow presidential candidates, who claim that Trump is himself a lieutenant of the Dark Lord. The Republican frontrunner took to Twitter to refute this claim: ÃÂDefinitely not a follower of Sauron. The palantÃÂ­r in Trump Tower lobby is for decoration only ÃÂ not for communicating with dark lords!ÃÂ"	1
63	"PELHAM, N.C. ÃÂ In today's racially charged environment, there's a label that even the KKK disavows: white supremacy.

Standing on a muddy dirt road in the dead of night near the North Carolina-Virginia border, masked Ku Klux Klan members claimed Donald Trump's election as president proves whites are taking back America from blacks, immigrants, Jews and other groups they describe as criminals and freeloaders. America was founded by and for whites, they say, and only whites can run a peaceful, productive society.

But still, the KKK members insisted in an interview with The Associated Press, they're not white supremacists, a label that is gaining traction in the country since Trump won with the public backing of the Klan, neo-Nazis and other white racists.

Related: Charleston Church Massacre Survivor Tells of Watching Son Die as Trial Begins

""We're not white supremacists. We believe in our race,"" said a man with a Midwestern accent and glasses just hours before a pro-Trump Klan parade in a nearby town. He, like three Klan compatriots, wore a robe and pointed hood and wouldn't give his full name, in accordance with Klan rules.

Claiming the Klan isn't white supremacist flies in the face of its very nature. The Klan's official rulebook, the Kloran ÃÂ published in 1915 and still followed by many groups ÃÂ says the organization ""shall ever be true in the faithful maintenance of White Supremacy,"" even capitalizing the term for emphasis.

Watchdog groups also consider the Klan a white supremacist organization, and experts say the groups' denials are probably linked to efforts to make their racism more palatable.

Still, KKK groups today typically renounce the term. The same goes for extremists including members of the self-proclaimed ""alt-right,"" an extreme branch of conservatism mixing racism, white nationalism and populism.

""We are white separatists, just as Yahweh in the Bible told us to be. Separate yourself from other nations. Do not intermix and mongrelize your seed,"" said one of the Klansmen who spoke along the muddy lane.

The Associated Press interviewed the men, who claimed membership in the Loyal White Knights of the KKK, in a nighttime session set up with help of Chris Barker, a KKK leader who confirmed details of the group's ""Trump victory celebration"" in advance of the event. As many as 30 cars paraded through the town of Roxboro, North Carolina, some bearing Confederate and KKK flags.

Barker didn't participate, though: He and a Klan leader from California were arrested hours earlier on charges linked to the stabbing of a third KKK member during a fight, sheriff's officials said. Both men were jailed; the injured man was recovering.

The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, which monitor white extremist organizations and are tracking an increase in reports of racist incidents since the election, often use the ""white supremacist"" label when describing groups like the Klan; white nationalism and white separatism are parts of the ideology. But what exactly is involved?

The ADL issued a report last year describing white supremacists as ""ideologically motivated by a series of racist beliefs, including the notion that whites should be dominant over people of other backgrounds, that whites should live by themselves in a whites-only society, and that white people have their own culture and are genetically superior to other cultures.""

That sounds a lot like some of the ideas espoused by today's white radicals, yet they reject the label. That's likely because they learned the lessons of one-time Klan leader David Duke, who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana this year, said Penn State University associate professor Josh Inwood.

""(There was) this peddling of kinder, softer white supremacy. He tried to pioneer a more respectable vision of the Klan,"" Inwood said."	0
64	"Donald Trump is going to be elected president.

The American people voted for him a long time ago.

They voted for him when The History Channel went from showing documentaries about the Second World War to ÃÂPawn StarsÃÂ and ÃÂSwamp People.ÃÂ

They voted for him when The Discovery Channel went from showing ÃÂLost Treasures of the Yangtze ValleyÃÂ to ÃÂNaked and Afraid.ÃÂ

They voted for him when The Learning Channel moved from something you could learn from to ÃÂMy 600-lb Life.ÃÂ

They voted for him when CBS went from airing ÃÂHarvest of ShameÃÂ to airing ÃÂBig Brother.ÃÂ

These networks didnÃÂt make these programming changes by accident. They were responding to what the American people actually wanted. And what they wanted was ÃÂNaked and AfraidÃÂ and ÃÂDuck Dynasty.ÃÂ

The polls may show that Donald Trump is losing to Hillary Clinton, but donÃÂt you believe those polls. When the AC Nielsen Company selects a new Nielsen family, they disregard the new familyÃÂs results for the first three months. The reason: when they feel they are being monitored, people lie about what they are watching. In the first three months, knowing they are being watched, they will tune into PBS. But over time they get tired of pretending. Then it is back to the Kardashians.

The same goes for people who are being asked by pollsters for whom they are voting. They will not say Donald Trump. It is too embarrassing. But the truth is, they like Trump. He is just like their favorite shows on TV.

Mindless entertainment.

TrumpÃÂs replacement of Paul Manafort with BreitbartÃÂs Steve Bannon shows that Trump understands how Americans actually think. They think TV. They think ratings. They think entertainment.

We are a TV-based culture. We have been for some time now. The average American spends 5 hours a day, every day, watching TV. After sleep, it is our number one activity.

More shockingly, we spend 8.5 hours a day staring at screens ÃÂ phones, tablets, computers. And more and more of the content on those devices is also video and TV.

If you spend 5-8 hours a day, every day, for years and years doing the same thing it has an impact on you. For the past 40 years, we have devoted 5-8 hours a day staring at a screen ÃÂ every day. And we havenÃÂt been watching Judy Woodruff. We have been watching reality TV shows. That is what we love. That is what we resonate to. ÃÂThe Real Housewives of Atlanta.ÃÂ

The French may love food. The Italians may love opera. What we love is TV. We are TV culture. It defines who we are.

In the 1950s, early television was allowed, with many restrictions, to be an observational guest at political conventions. They were quiet ÃÂflies on the wall,ÃÂ carefully and quietly commentating on what they saw way down below. They did not get involved in the process. Today, they ARE the process. Today, political conventions are nothing but carefully directed TV shows. Likewise ÃÂdebates.ÃÂ They exist only to entertain a TV audience. TV and entertainment now dictate everything political. It is a never-ending show. The biggest reality show on air.

And Donald Trump is great TV.

He knows how to entertain.

He understands ratings.

Hillary Clinton is crap TV.

She may be smarter, better prepared, a better politician. It wonÃÂt matter. She is terrible entertainment.

ThatÃÂs just how it is. Depressing, but true.

He is Kim Kardashian. She is Judy Woodruff.

Who gets better ratings?

Who would you rather watch for the next four years?

Honestly...

In 1825, the great French gastronom Brillat de Savarind said, ÃÂTell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are.ÃÂ Today, in America, we can safely say, ÃÂTell me what you watch, and I will tell you what you are.ÃÂ

And what do we watch?

It isnÃÂt ÃÂPBS NewsHour.ÃÂ"	0

What a treat as The Founders explain their intentions AS WE NOW KNOW THEM TO BE! Still perplexed? Here comes the unbelievably life-like Justice Scalia! HeÃÂll explain it all to your frightened children! Watch with pride as he firmly tells your family that the Founders never intended anything except your right to carry a concealed semi-automatic weapon! And if that doesnÃÂt do the trick, head to the Romneyland RevolvingTheater and watch the breath-taking, zany acrobatics of the Corporations Are People Dancers! After the show, the kids will be so clown-shit crazy, theyÃÂll buy just about anything! Corporations are people. People are lizards. Dogs are bagels. Up is down. Night is day... Hey, folks! ItÃÂs all good! ItÃÂs Mr. Founding Fathers Wild Ride!

Afterward, why not gently canoe down the canals of the Axis of Evil Global Village. See a country you donÃÂt like? Set your coordinates and pick it off! Yes, in Romneyland itÃÂs a small world and itÃÂs getting smaller!
Finally, wind up the day with a gentle stroll down Ghost Town Main Street. Check out the quaint shops. Hey! ThereÃÂs the butcher, the baker, and the candle-stick maker! And theyÃÂre all standing outside their quaint shops which are all quaintly closed for business! Because itÃÂs Sunday? No, Sir! Because itÃÂs Romneyland!"	0
67	"President-elect Donald Trump escalated his rhetoric against President Obama on Wednesday, accusing the current president of ÃÂroadblocksÃÂ leading up to Inauguration Day.

In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump said he was ÃÂdoing [his] best to disregardÃÂ the ÃÂinflammatory ÃÂ statements and roadblocksÃÂ from Mr. Obama:

Mr. Trump was presumably still responding to Mr. ObamaÃÂs comments in a podcast interview released Monday, in which he said he would have been able to ÃÂmobilizeÃÂ Americans against Mr. Trump had he been able to run for a third term in 2016.

ÃÂI am confident in this vision because IÃÂm confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I couldÃÂve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,ÃÂ Mr. Obama said in the interview with David Axelrod, his former senior political advisor, which was released on AxelrodÃÂs podcast AxeFiles. ÃÂI know that in conversations that IÃÂve had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one.ÃÂ

These comments appear to have gotten under Mr. TrumpÃÂs skin: WednesdayÃÂs tweet is the third in three days about Mr. Obama.

On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted that there is ÃÂNO WAYÃÂ Mr. Obama could have defeated him if he had been able to run for a third term this year:

And on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said Mr. Obama ÃÂcampaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lostÃÂ:

Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama seemed to move past the scathing campaign trail rhetoric in the weeks immediately following Election Day, talking by phone on several occasions and speaking in positive terms about their interactions.

In a meeting with The New York Times in November, Mr. Trump described his ÃÂgreat meetingÃÂ with Mr. Obama. ÃÂI didnÃÂt know if IÃÂd like him,ÃÂ Mr. Trump said. ÃÂI probably thought that maybe I wouldnÃÂt, but I did. I really enjoyed him a lot.ÃÂ

But as Inauguration Day approaches, it appears that goodwill is not going to last. Mr. Trump has been critical of several of Mr. ObamaÃÂs recent decisions, including the abstention on the United Nations Security Council vote condemning Israeli settlements.

Mr. Obama, too, has offered veiled criticisms of Mr. Trump in recent public speeches and appearances. For example, speaking aside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Pearl Harbor on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said that ÃÂeven when hatred burns hottest, even when the tug of tribalism is at its most primal, we must resist the urge to turn inward. We must resist the urge to demonize those who are different.ÃÂ"	0
68	"WASHINGTON, D.C. ÃÂ Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and other members of the Islamic StateÃÂs leadership council have provided more than five million dollars in campaign contributions to Republican presidential candidates this year, according to a campaign finance report released by the Republican National Committee last week.

According to the report, more than half of the GOPÃÂs leading presidential contenders including Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have received upwards of one million dollars from the Islamic State. However, specific standards set in place by the Federal Election Committee limit individual donors to a maximum contribution of $2,700 per year. In addition, the FEC strictly prohibits foreign nationals from making any sort of contribution toward elections held in the United States.

To the delight of the RNC, the Islamic State has found a convenient loophole to bypass these restrictions. Using the same global financial networks already in place meant to provide funding to its various terror operations, ISIS is able to funnel cash through a number of waypoints before it reaches sympathetic Americans residing in the United States. Then, using funds provided by the Islamic State, individuals simply write a check for the maximum donation allowed, payable to a presidential candidateÃÂs campaign.

ÃÂItÃÂs really an ingenious system,ÃÂ said James Arevalo, assistant campaign manager for Senator Ted Cruz. ÃÂObviously the senator doesnÃÂt see eye to eye with the Islamic State on some issues,ÃÂ Arevalo told CNN, continuing, ÃÂThat said, we certainly share very similar beliefs and values with ISIS, particularly when it comes to womenÃÂs rights and gun control.ÃÂ Arevalo added that candidates have a ÃÂmoral obligationÃÂ to meet the uphold the values of supporters and donors alike.

In the wake of the nationÃÂs most recent mass shooting that left fourteen people dead and another twenty-two injured in San Bernardino, California, the Republican party, at the request of the Islamic State and the National Rifle Association, once again blocked legislation that would enact stricter gun control policies in the United States.

Currently there are an estimated 700,000 people on the U.S. governmentÃÂs terror watch list with several thousand residing in the United States. Legislation proposed by Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein would have prevented terror suspects, felons, and individuals with a history of mental illness from purchasing firearms.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, who opposed the legislation, told CBS This Morning that the act of blocking suspected terrorists and convicted felons from legally obtaining firearms would infringe ÃÂupon the rights of law-abiding citizens.ÃÂ"	1
69	"CULLMAN, Al. ÃÂ An independent study conducted by the bipartisan policy group Alliance for Community Organizations seeking Reform Now has determined that just over fifty-nine percent of voters who support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suffer from moderate to severe illiteracy.

Posing as representatives from the Nationalist Reform Council ÃÂ a fictional conservative action group ÃÂ ACORN officials staged several mock elections last month at community centers throughout Cullman County, Alabama, under the pretense of helping residents register to vote in time for the general election. ÃÂWe were really pleased with the turnout,ÃÂ said Matthew Breyer, who heads ACORNÃÂs northern Alabama office. ÃÂWe were able to register nearly twenty thousand voters over the span of three days.ÃÂ

Once residents were successfully registered to vote, ACORN officials ushered them into a room where about a dozen voting booths had been set up. ÃÂWe wanted to get an idea of the average voterÃÂs understanding of the election process,ÃÂ Breyer said before adding that voters were asked to enter a booth and cast their vote for the candidate of their choice. However, unbeknownst to participants, the ballots had been slightly altered. ÃÂUnder the category ÃÂU.S. President/U.S. Vice President,ÃÂ you had the option for Clinton/Kaine centered inside a solid red rectangle,ÃÂ Breyer explained. ÃÂLikewise, the option for Trump/Pence was centered inside a solid blue rectangle.ÃÂ

Following the simulationÃÂs conclusion, ACORN officials were amazed to discover that more than two-thirds of registered Republicans in Cullman County who participated in the mock election had cast their votes in favor of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. ÃÂShe won by a massive landslide,ÃÂ recalled Breyer. ÃÂThe data we collected seems to suggest that a sizable number of Republican voters are unable to read above a third grade level and are simply casting votes by selecting the color that corresponds with their preferred party.ÃÂ

ÃÂThis should be a major wake up call and I think we need to take a hard look at the educational system in this country,ÃÂ said Fox News contributor and Republican strategist Barry King. ÃÂThis may have been a simulation but weÃÂve got multiple GOP leaders saying thereÃÂs going to be a rigged election next month. ThereÃÂs a legitimate fear that youÃÂll have altered ballots just like this popping up all over the country and as a result, weÃÂll be forced to suffer another four years under ObamaÃÂs failed policies.ÃÂ

In recent days, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has increasingly warned supporters that the upcoming presidential election will be rigged against him. ÃÂOf course there is a large-scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,ÃÂ the former reality TV star tweeted on Monday. Trump has called on his supporters to closely monitor voting centers and has said that he will not willingly accept defeat in the event Clinton secures the presidency.S

FacebookÃÂs role in providing Americans with political news has never been strongerÃÂor more controversial. Scholars worry that the social network can create ÃÂecho chambers,ÃÂ where users see posts only from like-minded friends and media sources. Facebook encourages users to ÃÂkeep an open mindÃÂ by seeking out posts that donÃÂt appear in their feeds.

To demonstrate how reality may differ for different Facebook users, The Wall Street Journal created two feeds, one ÃÂblueÃÂ and the other ÃÂred.ÃÂ If a source appears in the red feed, a majority of the articles shared from the source were classified as ÃÂvery conservatively alignedÃÂ in a large 2015 Facebook study. For the blue feed, a majority of each sourceÃÂs articles aligned ÃÂvery liberal.ÃÂ These aren't intended to resemble actual individual news feeds.

71	"The Berlin attack is opening peopleÃÂs eyes to the situation at hand, and they are blaming terrorist organizations like ISIS, but theyÃÂre not the only ones facing peopleÃÂs wrath.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing huge backlash in the aftermath of the terrorist attack that killed 12 peopleÃÂbecause of her open immigration policies, as per The Sun.

Many people are saying it is because of her that this attack took place, because of her sympathy for Muslim refugees seeking asylum in any country that will take them.

But thereÃÂs one problem with these refugeesÃÂwherever they go, attacks, murders, and rapes are increasing. Anywhere where these migrants are, violence follows.

ItÃÂs not looking good for the chancellor, who is up for reelection soon. She may not even get a chance to do so with so many of the German people calling for her blood. Many are blaming her for these deaths of innocent people.

ÃÂThese are MerkelÃÂs dead,ÃÂ said Marcus Pretzell, chairman of the Alternative for Germany party in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Klaus Bouillon of MerkelÃÂs CDU party also said to Saarland radio: ÃÂWe must state that we are in a state of war, although some people who want to see only the good cannot see.ÃÂ

Merkel was attending the ironically named ÃÂInternational Day of MigrantsÃÂ when the attack took place, and she stated she was ÃÂshocked and shakenÃÂ by the tragedy that had taken place. Merkel can pretty much kiss her career goodbye.

The German people are no longer as sympathetic to immigrants as some German politicians, due to the increase in assaults they are witnessing. Similar incidents have taken place in Ansbach, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Stuttgart, and Bielefeld.

MerkelÃÂs opponents are sure to be gaining more popularity as more are leaning towards the right and calling for these refugees to be booted out of the country. Many European countries are regretting their decisions to let these migrants into their countries.

This is why so many are intolerant of the Islamic faith and having these immigrants in their countriesÃÂviolence seems to follow them everywhere they go since for every three or four peaceful Muslims, there is one bent on destruction. Many other countries, including America, have seen increased attacks stemming from these migrants.

They all need to go back to their own countries, plain and simple. ItÃÂs like being in a destructive relationshipÃÂtheyÃÂre already going to tear themselves down, but if you cut-sling, you donÃÂt have to go down with them. And the American people are not going down with them.

And IÃÂm sure that the German people donÃÂt want to go down either. Merkel is sure to not be elected next year for her fourth term as chancellor, especially with Pretzell laying the blame at her feet. ItÃÂs time to cease the sympathy for Muslim migrants, because itÃÂs only hurting the countries that take them in."	1
72	"Tillerson says things ÃÂcould have gone really badÃÂ for him if people had followed through on their vows to stop climate change.
IRVING, TXÃÂSaying the multinational oil and gas conglomerate had ÃÂreally dodged a bullet,ÃÂ ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson told reporters Wednesday how relieved he was now that it was finally too late to do anything about climate change.

The 64-year-old petroleum executive, who acknowledged that throughout his career he had feared the public might take action to curb rising temperatures by imposing emissions restrictions or mandating a switch to alternative energy, said he was just happy that the window for avoiding the planetÃÂs environmental destruction had closed, and that the entire industry was now free to carry on as usual.

ÃÂI was really worried for a while there that some kind of law would be passed to stop us from releasing all those hydrocarbons into the atmosphere, but I guess not,ÃÂ said Tillerson, describing how he felt as if a tremendous weight had been lifted from his shoulders now that catastrophic climate change was an inescapable certainty. ÃÂSeriously, itÃÂs a huge load off. There were a number of real tense years after the recycling movement picked up momentum when we thought people might all turn away from fossil fuels next. But itÃÂs just so reassuring to know that we passed the point where itÃÂs no longer possible to stop global warming through environmental regulation or green energy or anything like that.ÃÂ

ÃÂNow I can finally just relax,ÃÂ he continued. ÃÂThis really makes things so much easier.ÃÂ

The CEO remarked that, back when it was still possible to halt the devastating effects of climate change, he constantly feared that the energy industry would be forced to make costly concessions toward sustainability, perhaps investing in expensive technology that would reduce oil and gas companiesÃÂ environmental impact, and thereby severely harm his corporationÃÂs bottom line.

Tillerson told reporters that growing public interest in wind and solar energy gave him ÃÂa pretty good scareÃÂ for a while, but noted how he eventually came to realize the publicÃÂs engagement was largely limited to vocalizing support for the initiatives rather than taking any substantive action to move the overall energy sector in those directions. He also admitted to losing sleep in 2009 when Congress considered regulating carbon emissions with a cap-and-trade system, although he said he now felt silly for ever believing that might actually happen.

While he became less worried about the possibility of government regulation after seeing the rapid melting of polar ice caps go completely unchecked, Tillerson stated that he was careful not to get his hopes up too high until humanity had blown through every last milestone for averting the worst effects of global warming, including atmospheric carbon dioxide surpassing 400 parts per million and average worldwide temperatures exceeding 1 degree Celsius above preindustrial levels.

ÃÂAfter scientists started saying we were in the middle of a global mass extinction event and still nobody at any level did anything to try to stop itÃÂthatÃÂs when I knew we were in the clear,ÃÂ said Tillerson, remarking that, by that point, he had become certain everyone would just keep driving their gas-powered vehicles and running their air conditioners 24 hours a day no matter what. ÃÂThereÃÂs just no way people are going to start switching over to renewables at this point. Hell, even if the whole world demanded new fuel-efficiency standards today, theyÃÂd be completely useless now that weÃÂre beyond the point of no return, so really, why even bother?ÃÂ

ÃÂAnd thank goodness,ÃÂ he added. ÃÂEveryoneÃÂs complete hopelessness about the whole situation really is the best thing that could have happened to us.ÃÂ"	0
73	"ItÃÂs impossible to miss the ÃÂHillary for PrisonÃÂ signs at Trump rallies. At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. ÃÂOh for goodness ÃÂ that is not going to happen,ÃÂ she said. ÃÂIÃÂm not even going to answer that question.ÃÂ

Based on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.

For decades sheÃÂs been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as ÃÂa congenital liarÃÂ and accused of covering up her husbandÃÂs misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the ÃÂHillary is a liarÃÂ videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or ÃÂzone of privacyÃÂ that she protects too fiercely. ItÃÂs a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny sheÃÂs attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.

I would be ÃÂdead richÃÂ, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours IÃÂve spent covering just about every ÃÂscandalÃÂ that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor IÃÂve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. IÃÂm not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.

Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.

The yardsticks I use for measuring a politicianÃÂs honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, IÃÂve looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. IÃÂm on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.

The connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up ÃÂraising serious questionsÃÂ about ÃÂpotentialÃÂ conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.

As for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest ÃÂpants on fireÃÂ rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).


I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABCÃÂs George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.

The same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?

Colin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of HarvardÃÂs Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. ÃÂWe expect purity from women candidates,ÃÂ he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, ÃÂitÃÂs seen as dishonestÃÂ, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove DiersingÃÂs point when he asked Clinton: ÃÂHave you always told the truth?ÃÂ She gave an honest response, ÃÂIÃÂve always tried to, always. Always.ÃÂ Pelley said she was leaving ÃÂwiggle roomÃÂ. What politician wouldnÃÂt?

Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the ClintonsÃÂ private life. The distrust continues.

These are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesnÃÂt have rhino hide, and during her husbandÃÂs first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.


Like most politicians, sheÃÂs switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.

Still, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.

ItÃÂs fair to expect more transparency. But itÃÂs a double standard to insist on her purity."	0
74	"The campaign to rally support for Donald TrumpÃÂs pick to head the Justice Department is growing, with former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who served under President Bill Clinton, now joining the effort.

In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Freeh offered his ÃÂstrong recommendationÃÂ that Senators confirm their colleague Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as the next attorney general, defending his record on civil rights, which has become a key concern for critics.

ÃÂI have known Jeff since 1989 when we worked together as prosecutors on one of the most important civil rights cases investigated and prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice,ÃÂ Freeh wrote. ÃÂ[I] have always been greatly impressed with his commitment to the rule of law, his fair and balanced prosecutorial judgment, and his personal dedication to protecting civil rights.ÃÂ

What Jeff Sessions Has Said About Race and Civil Rights
After Sessions was announced as TrumpÃÂs pick for attorney general, top Democrats and some civil rights groups expressed concern over decades-old allegations that he made racist remarks when he was U.S. Attorney in Alabama. Others alleged -- under oath during his 1986 confirmation hearings for a federal judgeship -- that he once called a white civil rights lawyer a ÃÂdisgrace to his raceÃÂ and dubbed some efforts by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ""un-American.""

During the hearings, one lawyer who worked with Sessions claimed the lawmaker told him he thought the KKK was ""OK until I found out they smoked pot."" Sessions said the comment was a joke but apologized.

Under oath himself, Sessions also insisted he harbored no racial bias and said the allegations were either false or being taken out of context. He was nevertheless blocked from becoming a judge.

In his letter on Tuesday, Freeh pointed to SessionsÃÂ work on the 1989 murders of a federal judge in Alabama and an NAACP official in Georgia.

ÃÂI was struck with JeffÃÂs fierce determination to solve these civil rights murders, which so gravely impacted the rule of law and the guarantee of civil rights in America,ÃÂ Freeh wrote, noting that, ÃÂJeff and his office were key decision-makers in formulating and implementing the investigative strategy which ultimately led to the arrest and conviction of Walter Moody for these murders.ÃÂ

Meanwhile, a conservative judicial organization, the Judicial Crisis Network, has created an entire website devoted to pushing Sessions' confirmation.

ÃÂHe is a world-class legal mind and a tough but fair lawyer with invaluable experience,ÃÂ says the website, ConfirmSessions.com. ÃÂKnown for his deep respect for the Constitution and adherence to the rule of law, Sen. Sessions has worked tirelessly to defend the civil rights and legal rights of all Americans.ÃÂ

Democratic Party leaders, meanwhile, have called SessionsÃÂ nomination ÃÂdeeply troubling.ÃÂ

ÃÂOver the course of his career, Senator Sessions used the power of the courts to discriminate against civil rights leaders, allegedly used racially charged language to disparage minorities, expressed support for the KKK and then tried to dismiss it as a joke, celebrated the gutting of the Voting Rights Act, opposed same-sex marriage, denied the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade, voted against greater access to healthcare for veterans, blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act, and voted against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act,"" Democratic National Committee Interim Chair Donna Brazile said in a statement last month.

Freeh, who served as FBI director from 1993 to June 2001, expressed no such concerns, calling Sessions a ÃÂfriendÃÂ who has had a ÃÂdistinguishedÃÂ career in public service.

ÃÂI believe that Jeff will be an outstanding Attorney General for the Nation,ÃÂ Freeh said."	0
75	"WASHINGTON ÃÂ Donald Trump will ÃÂ officially ÃÂ become president next month.

Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed from 538 electors casting their ballots, in a day of normally ceremonial voting that drew attention amid intense social media pressure and protests in state capitols.

Despite a last-minute push by outside progressive and Libertarian groups, there was no rebellion. In fact, most of the ""faithless"" electors appeared to be Hillary Clinton defectors in Washington state, with three voting for former secretary of State Colin Powell and one for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American an environmental activist. Two Texas GOP electors went rogue and didn't vote for Trump.

The meetings, which occur more than a month after the Nov. 8 election, are typically a formality. This year, Trump critics mounted a vocal campaign appealing to the Republican electors pledged to vote for him. The official results of the vote will be announced before Congress on Jan. 6, although the results from each state were released throughout the day Monday.

Is this any way to choose a president? Only half of Americans think so
GOP electors targeted with $500K ad buy in final anti-Trump push
Aides: Critics trying to use Electoral College to de-legitimize Trump
Electors received thousands of emails and phone calls arguing Trump is unqualified, as the first president in the nationÃÂs history with no military or government experience and with potential conflicts of interest due to his business empire. Confirmation by the FBI and CIA that the Russian government hacked ClintonÃÂs campaign and the Democratic National Committee seeking to help Trump win the election have amplified their calls.

ÃÂFrankly, at this point, I'm wondering if Putin helped Trump win the Republican primary,"" Chris Suprun, a Texas elector who's been an outspoken critic, said before the voting began. In Rhode Island, electors passed a motion calling for an independent, bipartisan investigation into Russian intervention in the election as Congress debates whether the matter should be reviewed by Republican-led committees or as an independent probe.

Thousands of protesters gathered outside state capitals throughout the country. Yet in the end, the rebellion fell far short of the dozens of potential faithless electors that some Trump opponents said could materialize.


Opponents would have needed 37 GOP electors to switch their votes. The one alternative to Trump, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, had told electors not to vote for him. Even if there were a mass defection, the matter would have kicked to the Republican-led House of Representatives, which was unlikely to override their own partyÃÂs president. Further, the Republican National Committee conducted a parallel whip effort to make sure electors stick to the plan to vote for Trump.

Clinton won more than 2.8 million more votes than Trump nationwide. But Trump won a majority of the 538 electoral votes ÃÂ the state-by-state system created by the nation's founders based on the size of a stateÃÂs congressional delegation.

A short history lesson on presidents winning without the popular vote
ItÃÂs the second time in recent history, including Democrat Al GoreÃÂs loss in 2000 to George W. Bush, that the person winning the popular vote lost the election. Before that, it hadnÃÂt been since 1888, when Benjamin Harrison beat Grover Cleveland, that a candidate won the presidency despite losing the popular vote.

The trend is causing Democrats to question the system by which the nation chooses its leaders, according to a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll. It finds 50% of registered voters believe the Electoral College should choose the president. Yet more than four in 10 ÃÂ 42% ÃÂ say the Constitution should be amended so the popular vote prevails in choosing the commander in chief. Liberals are most likely to want a change while conservatives want to keep the current system.

Trump assumes the mantle with an electorate deeply skeptical of his presidency, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. While the percentage of voters who view him positively has increased to 41%, thatÃÂs 7 points less than those who view him unfavorably. While 45% said they were optimistic and satisfied about Trump as president, itÃÂs 21 points below ObamaÃÂs number in January 2009 and 14 points below George W. BushÃÂs number at the same time in 2000."	0
76	"TAMPA (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂInfused with a sense of urgency as Election Day nears, the Trump campaign has enlisted President Vladimir Putin, of Russia, to appear with the Republican nominee in a dizzying array of swing-state rallies over the weekend.

Putin will be the most visible Trump surrogate in the final weekend of the campaign, as he tries to fire up voters in Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, and Nevada.

The Russian President seemed to relish the warm response he got at his first Trump rally, in Tampa, where he led the crowd in a raucous chant of ÃÂLock her up.ÃÂ

Trump praised PutinÃÂs talent for politics by noting that he had won the Russian election in 2012 by a landslide. ÃÂHe got sixty-four per cent of the vote, and no one else even came close,ÃÂ Trump said. ÃÂHeÃÂs terrific.ÃÂ

Putin, whose English is rudimentary at best, kept his remarks brief at the Tampa rally, but echoed Melania TrumpÃÂs recent call for an end to bullying.

A Republican strategist, Harland Dorrinson, called the Trump campaignÃÂs use of Putin in crucial battleground states ÃÂvery, very smart.ÃÂ

ÃÂAt this point, you really couldnÃÂt ask for a more effective surrogate,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂYouÃÂd much rather see Trump up there with Putin than with, say, Chris Christie.ÃÂ

While some in the media criticized the Trump campaign for allowing Putin to influence the outcome of a U.S. election, the Republican nomineeÃÂs campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, pushed back in an appearance on CNN.

ÃÂThis is just another case of media bias against Donald Trump,ÃÂ she said. ÃÂJay Z and BeyoncÃÂ©, who have no experience in government at all, are allowed to campaign for Hillary Clinton, but Vladimir Putin, who actually runs an entire country, canÃÂt appear with Donald Trump? Come on.ÃÂ"	0
77	"GREENSBORO, N.C. (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂHillary Clinton is ÃÂplotting to rig the election by getting more votes than I do,ÃÂ Donald J. Trump warned his supporters on Friday.

Speaking at a rally, Trump detailed what he called ClintonÃÂs ÃÂvast conspiracyÃÂ to accrue more votes than he does on Election Day.

ÃÂThe media wonÃÂt tell you this, but Crooked Hillary is going around the country every single day, trying to get more votes than I do,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂThatÃÂs how sheÃÂs going to rig it, folks.ÃÂ

He called the current sexual-assault allegations against him ÃÂa plot by the Clintons to draw attention away from HillaryÃÂs evil plot to get votes.ÃÂ

ÃÂIs it just a coincidence that these accusations come up at the same time that Crooked Hillary is trying to rig the election by getting votes?ÃÂ he said. ÃÂThe way things are going, I would not be surprised at all if, on Election Day, she has many, many more votes than I do.ÃÂ

ÃÂThereÃÂs something going on, folks,ÃÂ he added.

But, in a sign that Trump does not intend to take ClintonÃÂs scheme to get more votes lying down, he ended his remarks with an ominous threat. ÃÂIf, on Election Day, Hillary Clinton has more votes than I do, I will sue everyone who voted for her,ÃÂ he said."	0

Franklin Graham, son of famed preacher Billy Graham, has urged Christians to vote for thrice married, casino owner Donald Trump. According to Graham, who feels Trump has been chosen by God, the reality TV star was the only thing standing between Christians and death camps.

ÃÂThe liberal Democrats are openly hostile to Christians,ÃÂ said Graham in an interview on WEHW radio. ÃÂWe wonÃÂt survive four more years of Democrat-led government. I can see them rounding Christians up and putting us in death camps unless we follow their laws that want to grant special rights to gays and transgender people.ÃÂ

Scientists and academics alike have already voiced concerns that Sarah PalinÃÂs strong disbelief in climate change could have dramatic consequences for the planet.
ÃÂGod killed the dinosaursÃÂ

Some scientists openly fear that Sarah Palin could be the end of the science establishment as we know it and would relegate the Office of Science and Technology ÃÂto the dark agesÃÂ.

ÃÂI mean, this is scary as hellÃÂ explains climatologist Dan B. Evans from the University of California, Berkeley.

ÃÂThe woman claimed in an interview in 2009 that God killed the dinosaurs and that he had sent the flood to purge the dinosaurs off of the earth,ÃÂ he warned, visibly concerned.

ÃÂWith Sarah Palin as director of the Office of Science and Technology, we are definitely stepping into la-la landÃÂ he adds.

A scientific community in disbelief

Sarah PalinÃÂs strong stance against climate change in the past has earned her an army of detractors, especially within environmentalist circles.

In a 2009 UN statement that acknowledged that 97% of climate experts agree humans are causing global warming, Sarah Palin responded, ÃÂthe documents show that there was no real consensus even within the CRU crowdÃÂ and called the 2007 IPCC report a ÃÂload of rubbishÃÂ and a ÃÂfraudÃÂ.

ÃÂWith irresponsible leaders such as Trump and Palin in the White House, polar ice cap melting will increase dramatically and waters could rise an easy 33% in the next ten yearsÃÂ has even admitted James Hillocks, a top Greenpeace climate scientist.

Environmentalists fear the worst as President-elect Donald Trump has already threatened to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Pact, potentially dealing a death blow to the whole accord by refuting the international consensus on climate change, believe experts."	1
81	"OTTAWA ÃÂ Conservative Senator Nicole Eaton claimed Thursday that she was unaware of her appointment to the Senate some seven years ago, in addition to claiming that she was did not know she was a director of an offshore corporation in the Bahamas some twelve years ago.

ÃÂThis is a simple misunderstanding, one that IÃÂm sure happens to many Canadians,ÃÂ explained Eaton told the press while attending a fundraiser gala for slightly less wealthy children. ÃÂI donÃÂt recall ever being told I was an Officer of Parliament. I know this Harper fellow vaguely, and I thought I was signing up for one of those European cruises on Parliament Hill. I really leave that appointment business to my accountants and lawyers.ÃÂ

Eaton claims that it was her close friend from her fine-art collecting club, simply known as ÃÂMuffyÃÂ, who submitted her name to the Prime MinisterÃÂs Officer for a position in the Upper Chamber.

ÃÂSomehow she placed my name on these Senate documents at the ceremony and took the oath for me. I had absolutely no idea what the devil she was signing me up for. I thought she was adding another Van Gogh for my collection.ÃÂ

The Harper-appointed Senator, most famous for demanding the audit of environmental charities, calling CanadaÃÂs national symbol a ÃÂdentally defective ratÃÂ, and attempting to frame Roger Rabbit, promptly reported to Senate Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson that she was oblivious to the fact that the debates and committees she attended over the last seven years had anything to do with the Senate.

ÃÂI thought I was at the bridge club, it was so dull there. Fortunately, we only had to sit for half the year.ÃÂ

82	"Barack Obama has sensationally told CNNÃÂs Wolf Blitzer that he will NOT vacate the Oval office if Donald J. Trump is elected the 45th President of the United States.

The current president claims he is ÃÂfully preparedÃÂ to ignore the popular vote if it means stopping Trump, having found what he believes is a little known loophole that would allow him to remain in charge until a re-election is called.

ÃÂAs president, I must do what I feel is in the best interests of our nation,ÃÂ he explained. ÃÂIf the American people elected ÃÂthe DonaldÃÂ then I will be forced to take whatever actions I deem necessary.ÃÂ

When asked by the CNN anchor if he would remain in charge, ObamaÃÂs response was firm. ÃÂI am not standing down as president if it means four years of President Trump,ÃÂ he said categorically.

The president was asked what exact lengths he would go to, to prevent the billionaire from being sworn in on January, 20th, 2017. ÃÂI am prepared to file a motion of ÃÂno confidenceÃÂ in our citizens thereby taking their vote away from them,ÃÂ he confessed.

ÃÂWait, youÃÂre willing to impeach the American people as voters?ÃÂ a possibly stunned Blitzer asked. ÃÂYes, if necessary,ÃÂ the President responded. ÃÂI cannot allow him into this chair, with his finger so close to the button. The power would go to his head immediately.ÃÂ

83	"Americans have trouble trusting the Clintons for many reasons, but near the top of the list is the infamous ÃÂClinton kill list,ÃÂ featuring the names of people close to Hillary and Bill that have died under mysterious circumstances.

Now, it appears that yet another name has been added to this list.

Former U.N. President John Ashe was reportedly found dead last Wednesday. Officials claim he died of a heart attack, but others suspect foul play. The Conservative Tribune reports that local police officers in Dobbs Ferry, New York argue that Ashe died from a workout accident that crushed his throat.

AsheÃÂs death became even more suspicious when police learned that he was scheduled to be in court Monday with Chinese businessman and co-defendant Ng Lap Seng. Ashe reportedly received $1 billion in donations from Seng during his term as president.

It was later revealed that Seng also illegally funneled several hundred thousand dollars to the Democrat National Committee during BillÃÂs presidency. An anonymous source told reporters that prosecutors planned to use this link to Ashe to convince him to testify against her.

ÃÂIt would have been very embarrassing,ÃÂ the source added. ÃÂHis death was conveniently timed.ÃÂ

Of course, conspiracy theorists believe that Ashe is just the latest victim of the Clintons. We wouldnÃÂt put it past them to take down anyone who has damning information against themÃÂand God only knows how long that list is.

86	"At least nine individuals have been arrested in Northern Virginia for attempting to support ISIS since the group rose to power in 2014, according to a report from law enforcement officials.

According to the report, which was obtained by The Washington Times, the nine individuals were arrested for providing or attempting to provide support to ISIS and included a police officer and several U.S. Army soldiers.

The Washington Times reports:

Law enforcement agencies have arrested nine Northern Virginia residents on charges of aiding the Islamic State since the terrorist group rose to power in Syria and Iraq in 2014 and launched social media propaganda to attract followers, a government message to police states.

ÃÂ

Of the nine Northern Virginians who were arrested, all but one were in their teens and early 20s. They included a police officer, a Starbucks barista, Army soldiers, bankers and a cabdriver. Four of the nine graduated from Northern Virginia high schools, one with honors. Two attended Northern Virginia Community College.

According to the Times, one of the men, a U.S. army combat engineer named Mohammad Bilor Jalloh, attempted to purchase firearms in an attempt to carry out a ÃÂFort Hood styleÃÂ attack.

Another man, Metro police officer Nicholas Young, ÃÂtraveled to Libya and gave advice to Islamic State followers on how to avoid law enforcement monitoringÃÂ according to law enforcement officials.

Several others planned on creating online propaganda for the terror group, with one seeking to encourage ÃÂlone wolfÃÂ style attacks on Washington DC.

The report raises new concerns about the reach of the terror group into the U.S. homeland, and any future plans to import new refugees from troubled Muslim nations.

87	"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) ÃÂ Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal governmentÃÂs official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. Under the new order, it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty. This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.



During the press conference, the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is ÃÂdivisiveÃÂ and ÃÂcontrary to AmericaÃÂs deepest held values.ÃÂ

ÃÂThe pledge excludes so many Americans who are vital to making this country what it is,ÃÂ Obama said. ÃÂAsking someone to pledge their allegiance to our country excludes JehovahÃÂs Witnesses, Amish, Muslims, and many others whose religious beliefs prohibit strong displays of nationalism. By calling this ÃÂone nation under GodÃÂ, we exclude the millions of hard working atheists and agnostics who call America home. By saying ÃÂliberty and justice for allÃÂ, we ignore the grievances of millions of Hispanics, African Americans and Muslims who feel they have neither liberty nor justice.ÃÂ

Obama told reporters that he believes the inclusion of ÃÂunder GodÃÂ runs afoul of the First AmendmentÃÂs establishment clause. He summed up his press briefing by challenging congress to create a new pledge that more accurately reflects AmericaÃÂs values.

ÃÂI am willing to rescind my decision here today and allow the Pledge of Allegiance back into the schools if we can all agree on the creation of a new Pledge, something that is includes everyoneÃÂs beliefs and not just the belief of one nationality or faith.ÃÂ

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of president ObamaÃÂs decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in NovemberÃÂs general election. She echoed his concerns about the pledgeÃÂs language and suggested that the pledgeÃÂs mention of God sends the wrong message to AmericaÃÂs children.

ÃÂI fully support the President and the decision that he has made here today. In January, when I take office as the next President of the United States, unless I see otherwise, I will do my best to uphold this new law and ensure that it stays in effect.ÃÂ

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not mince words when voicing his contempt for the presidentÃÂs order, referring to the president as an ÃÂillegitimate Muslim traitor.ÃÂ



ÃÂAs a Christian nation, the Pledge of Allegiance helps our children be the greatest children out there, the best there is, greater than all the other children in this world combined. Obama, who founded ISIS by the way, wants them not to be great, he wants them to be weak, and by banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools, he has proven that here today. This is the first step in many in his master plan to force Sharia law onto this great country of ours before he leaves office in January. We all must remember that this is one nation under God and not some guy and his beliefs in whatever he chooses to believe.ÃÂ

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to ABC News about the ban.

ÃÂThis is a story about President Obama banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools.ÃÂ Bradley said. ÃÂI just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.ÃÂ

Lawrence Ketchum of the Secular Coalition for America told reporters that ObamaÃÂs decision to ban the Pledge is a victory for all those who oppose government control.

ÃÂWhen our children are forced to chant, ÃÂOne nation under GodÃÂ, whose God are they referring to exactly?ÃÂ Ketchum said, ÃÂFrom birth, children are indoctrinated and subjected to mind control, efforts to shape them into the perfect beings that society wants them to be. The Pledge of Allegiance is just one of the many tools used in a childÃÂs involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values.ÃÂ Ketchum continued, ÃÂThis is a great day not just for Atheists, but for all Americans who value freedom. Forcing children to pledge blind allegiance to this country and profess a belief in a God is extremely dangerous in developing young minds and amounts to little more than government mind control.ÃÂ

While Executive Order 13738 is likely to be a source of heated debate among Americans, constitutional scholar, Paul Horner, told ABC News that it is unlikely the law will be challenged in court.

ÃÂSince this law only affects federal employees and contractors and not the general populace, it is well within the traditional scope of a presidentÃÂs executive authority to pass this law. Any challenges would lack proper legal standing and more than like be quickly dismissed.ÃÂ



Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he believes in what Utah is doing.

ÃÂIt is important that children become the unique individuals that this country wants them to be. Conforming into the perfect little human beings that God intended them to be has always been the American way. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then weÃÂll burn in Hell for eternity.ÃÂ

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate aricles they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

ÃÂYou have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the sex reassignment surgery my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a little boy,ÃÂ Mikkleson said. ÃÂWe claim ÃÂto provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as wellÃÂ, but thatÃÂs just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thatÃÂs it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and IÃÂm only telling you this for legal reasons.ÃÂ Mikkleson continues, ÃÂA typical story of ours makes wild claims, using grammatical errors, misspellings and words like ÃÂumimumimaginativeÃÂ, ÃÂrecycledÃÂ, ÃÂhoaxÃÂ, saying that a story ÃÂillegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizationsÃÂ, but we list no links or sources of information, they are all just outrageous accusations by us. And that story will get 50,000 shares or more on Facebook, thatÃÂs a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences.ÃÂ Mikkelson further explains, ÃÂIt is common for us to rewrite a story weÃÂre debunking if we donÃÂt like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a personÃÂs name from the original article and then called him a liar, itÃÂs so funny! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,ÃÂ Mikkelson laughs. ÃÂAnd lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Our writers like Zarronandia go as far as to say that the story originated from ÃÂa clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false ÃÂnewsÃÂ storiesÃÂ. But we donÃÂt list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; ItÃÂs just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and as I said before, I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?ÃÂ

Originally composed by Colonel George Balch in 1887, The Pledge of Allegiance was later revised by Francis Bellamy in 1892 and formally adopted by Congress in 1942. The Pledge is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America. The official name of the Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945 and the last changes made to it came on Flag Day in 1954 when the words ÃÂunder GodÃÂ were added at a nursing school where CNA classes in Ann Arbor, Michigan were taking place.ÃÂ

88	"Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is a controversial character. But thereÃÂs no denying the emails he has picked up from inside the Democrat Party are real, and heÃÂs willing to expose Hillary Clinton.

Now, heÃÂs announcing that Hillary Clinton and her State Department were actively arming Islamic jihadists, which includes the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria.

Clinton has repeatedly denied these claims, including during multiple statements while under oath in front of the United States Senate.

WikiLeaks is about to prove Hillary Clinton deserves to be arrested:

The Reagan administration officials hoped to secure the release of several U.S. hostages, and then take proceeds from the arms sales to Iran, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua.
Sounds familiar?

In ObamaÃÂs second term, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authorized the shipment of American-made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood, and friendly to the Libyan rebels, in an effort to topple the Libyan/Gaddafi government, and then ship those arms to Syria in order to fund Al Qaeda, and topple Assad in Syria.

Clinton took the lead role in organizing the so-called ÃÂFriends of SyriaÃÂ (aka Al Qaeda/ISIS) to back the CIA-led insurgency for regime change in Syria.

Under oath Hillary Clinton denied she knew about the weapons shipments during public testimony in early 2013 after the Benghazi terrorist attack.

In an interview with Democracy Now, WikileaksÃÂ Julian Assange is now stating that 1,700 emails contained in the Clinton cache directly connect Hillary to Libya to Syria, and directly to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
Via The Duran

Here is the incredible transcript:

JUAN GONZÃÂLEZ: Julian, I want to mention something else. In March, you launched a searchable archive for over 30,000 emails and email attachments sent to and from Hillary ClintonÃÂs private email server while she was secretary of state. The 50,547 pages of documents span the time from June 2010 to August 2014; 7,500 of the documents were sent by Hillary Clinton herself. The emails were made available in the form of thousands of PDFs by the U.S. State Department as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. Why did you do this, and whatÃÂs the importance, from your perspective, of being able to create a searchable base?
JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, WikiLeaks has become the rebel library of Alexandria. It is the single most significant collection of information that doesnÃÂt exist elsewhere, in a searchable, accessible, citable form, about how modern institutions actually behave. And itÃÂs gone on to set people free from prison, where documents have been used in their court cases; hold the CIA accountable for renditions programs; feed into election cycles, which have resulted in the termination of, in some caseÃÂor contributed to the termination of governments, in some cases, taken the heads of intelligence agencies, ministers of defense and so on. So, you know, our civilizations can only be as good as our knowledge of what our civilisation is. We canÃÂt possibly hope to reform that which we do not understand.

So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, thatÃÂs there in those emails. ThereÃÂs more than 1,700 emails in Hillary ClintonÃÂs collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone."	1
89	"Legislators overseeing the CIA and other intelligence agencies have told the Guardian they will be vigilant about reprisals from Donald Trump over an internal assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to ensure TrumpÃÂs victory.

Fears of retaliation rose within US intelligence agencies over a tense weekend that saw Trump publicly dismiss not only the assessment but the basic competence of the intelligence apparatus.

ÃÂWhen the president-electÃÂs transition team is attempting to discredit the entire intelligence community [IC], it has never been more important for the IC and Congress to guard against possible political pressure or retaliation against intelligence analysts,ÃÂ Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told the Guardian.

Like his Democratic colleagues on the panel, Wyden is pressing Barack Obama for additional public disclosures revealing Russian electoral interference. Such pressure has placed the CIA and other intelligence agencies between the incoming president to whom they will soon answer and a chorus of legislators, mostly but not exclusively Democrats, who consider the Russia hack a national emergency.

It is not possible to gauge precisely how deep fears of retaliation run within the intelligence world. Two currently serving intelligence officers told the Guardian this weekend they had not heard their colleagues express such concerns.

One noted that civil-service laws prevented Trump from launching a purge, but also called attention to a report that Trump is combing through the energy department bureaucracy to identify people ÃÂwho have attended climate change policy conferencesÃÂ.

Former intelligence officers told the Guardian they considered retaliation by Trump to be all but a certainty after he is sworn into office next month. Trump still has several appointments to make at the highest levels of the intelligence apparatus, picks which are likely to be bellwethers for the new presidentÃÂs attitudes toward the agencies.

There is not just smoke here. There is a 10-alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid
Glenn Carle, former CIA officer
ÃÂThere is not just smoke here. There is a blazing 10-alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid, and Trump is standing half-burnt and holding a match,ÃÂ said Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer and interrogator.

ÃÂThe facts hurt, Trump wonÃÂt like the truth, and he will without question seek to destroy those individuals or organizations that say or do anything that he thinks harm his precious grandiosity.ÃÂ

After congressional Democrats called for additional briefings and public disclosures about an intelligence consensus that Russia made a deliberate decision to intervene in the election, Barack Obama ordered a new review of the evidence.

On Friday, the Washington Post reported that intelligence sources believe the Russians decided to penetrate the Democratic National CommitteeÃÂs digital networks with the goal of aiding Trump, not merely to spread uncertainty about the outcome of the election.

In response, Trump attacked the credibility of the intelligence agencies on which he will rely for early warning of security emergencies and geopolitical developments. His transition team said in a statement: ÃÂThese are the same people who said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.ÃÂ

Adam Schiff, the leading Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Trump ÃÂcannot abide the idea that Russian hacking helped his campaignÃÂ and was lashing out in a manner that undermined confidence in his handling of intelligence.

ÃÂIf Trump is willing to disregard sound intelligence now, and demean the hard-working and patriotic Americans who produced it, I fear what he will do as president when confronted with unpleasant truths,ÃÂ Schiff said.

ÃÂWill he accept the best insights of our agencies, or punish them for daring to contradict his assumptions?ÃÂ

TrumpÃÂs clash with the CIA comes at a moment of acute turmoil within intelligence circles. Obama officials jeopardized the tenure of National Security Agency chief Mike Rogers in a seemingly thwarted bureaucratic reorganization of the US surveillance and cybersecurity apparatus. Congressional sources have told the Guardian they expect to hold a public hearing on the issue in January.

Should Trump go through with the reshuffle, it will leave him appointing an NSA director as well as a director of national intelligence, after James Clapper announced his resignation last month. Trump has also been noncommittal about retaining the FBI director, James Comey, whose bureau houses significant sympathy for Trump.

Congressional Republicans are in an uncomfortable position, between a president of their own party and Russia, a traditional adversary.

Devin Nunes, a California Republican who chairs the House intelligence committee, said on Saturday Russian electoral hacking was ÃÂno surpriseÃÂ. He also blamed Obama for coming late to the threat out of ÃÂdelusions of ÃÂresettingÃÂ relations with RussiaÃÂ ÃÂ a policy that Trump is also pursuing.

On Sunday, anti-Trump GOP hawks Lindsey Graham and John McCain offered a different path, joining with leading Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed to plead for a bipartisan inquiry into the alleged Russian hacking, which they said endangered the country.

ÃÂWe have an obligation to inform the public about recent cyberattacks that have cut to the heart of our free society,ÃÂ the senators said in a joint statement.

ÃÂDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks.ÃÂ

 Trump: reports that Russia influenced US election are ÃÂridiculousÃÂ
Also on Sunday, Elijah Cummings, the Maryland Democrat on the investigations-heavy House oversight committee, pressured the Republican committee chairman, Jason Chaffetz, and speaker of the house Paul Ryan to ÃÂjoin us now in our effort to launch a robust and truly bipartisan investigation of Russian interference in our election that puts our nationÃÂs interests over the interests of any political partyÃÂ.

Carle, the retired CIA officer, said TrumpÃÂs temperament had played into RussiaÃÂs hands and put the president-elect on a collision course with the CIA.

He said: ÃÂLook, in my professional assessment as an intelligence officer, Trump has a reflexive, defensive, monumentally narcissistic personality, for whom the facts and national interest are irrelevant, and the only thing that counts is whatever gives personal advantage and directs attention to himself.

ÃÂHe is about the juiciest intelligence target an intelligence office could imagine. He groans with vulnerabilities. He will only work with individuals or entities that agree with him and build him up, and he is a shockingly easy intelligence ÃÂtargetÃÂ to manipulate.ÃÂ

Were Trump an intelligence officer himself, Carle said, ÃÂhe would be removed and possibly charged with having accepted the clandestine support of a hostile power to the harm of the United StatesÃÂ.

A senior intelligence official who was not cleared to talk to reporters supported the push to declassify additional material on the ÃÂserious matterÃÂ of the alleged Russian electoral interference, since ÃÂit happened on our watchÃÂ."	0
90	"NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂA once-prominent political career came to a shocking end on Friday as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was arrested for keying the limo of President-elect Donald J. Trump.

The incident, which rocked political circles in Trenton and Washington, happened in full view of the midtown-Manhattan crowds outside of Trump Tower, where the vandalized limo had been parked.

ÃÂSuddenly, this guy broke through security, whipped out his keys, and made a gigantic gash along the side of the limo,ÃÂ said Harland Dorrinson, a tourist from Missouri who witnessed the incident. ÃÂPolice started wrestling him to the ground, and I was, like, ÃÂHoly crap, thatÃÂs Chris Christie.ÃÂ ÃÂ

Fellow-Republicans reacted to ChristieÃÂs arrest with sadness and sympathy. ÃÂThis whole transition period has been tough on a lot of folks,ÃÂ former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney said.

Across New Jersey, residents like Carol Foyler, of Teaneck, said that they were shocked by their governorÃÂs spectacular fall. ÃÂI never would have guessed that this would be the thing heÃÂd go to jail for,ÃÂ she said."	0
91	"Finding a performer for the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump has not been easy, because many famous Liberals are still sitting up on their high horses.

Jackie Evancho, a teenage opera singer who got her start on AmericaÃÂs Got Talent, has agreed to sing the National Anthem for the inauguration. Many liberals have attacked her and her family, but proud Americans have supported her. Her music sales have quadrupled thanks to the American people! (via Breitbart)

EvanchoÃÂs 2011 ÃÂDream With MeÃÂ album and her 2010 ÃÂO Holy NightÃÂ are both sitting at No. 2 on the Billboard charts because of the American people and the pride they have in their country and this talented girl!

For her part, Jackie Evancho has expressed her excitement to sing at this event, which is a breath of fresh air compared to the other singers who have flat out refused to be a part of it, even though they were not even asked in the first place.

ÃÂI have recently been asked by the President-elect to perform the National Anthem for the swearing-in ceremony at the inauguration,ÃÂ Evancho stated. ÃÂIÃÂm so excited. ItÃÂs going to be awesome.ÃÂ At least someone has some American pride.

But liberals, of course, arenÃÂt about to hold back their disdain, even against a teenage girl. This is particularly ironic because of the details of EvanchoÃÂs family.

ÃÂMy family is kind of a big target. I have a transgender sister and so a lot of hate goes towards us,ÃÂ Evancho claimed. ÃÂBut I also get a lot of love. So, we pay most attention to that. Sometimes we get really annoyed with the hate, everyone does, we have to admit it but we just ignore it.ÃÂ

So, Liberals are adding further hate directed at an innocent family who are trying to support their transgender member. I thought liberals were supportive of transgender people? Apparently they only care about the hate directed at them if the transgender person agrees with their political views.

At 16, Jackie EvanchoÃÂs list of accomplishments already includes six studio albums. Her ÃÂO Holy Night EPÃÂ made her the youngest solo artist to reach platinum on the U.S. Billboard and also ranked her as the No. 1 Classical Albums Artist of 2011.

As one of the few people who are scheduled to perform for Donald TrumpÃÂs inauguration, the young singer clearly has a ton of talent. The Radio City Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir also planned to perform for the incoming President.

Liberals are nothing but a bunch of sore losers, and the fact that they would harass a young girl because of her choice to perform is sickening. The truth is, Liberals will direct their hatred at anyone if they canÃÂt get their way."	1
92	"In a recent interview with Pat RobertsonÃÂs television network, Donald Trump blathered that antigay conservatives the world over can rest easy knowing that heÃÂs committed to overturning the Supreme CourtÃÂs landmark decision that struck down state bans on same-sex marriage nationwide.

The Christian Broadcasting NetworkÃÂs David Brody asked the GOP presidential frontrunner what he thought of the Log Cabin Republicans calling him ÃÂone of the best, if not the best, pro-gay Republican candidates to ever run for the presidency.ÃÂ

Told that Evangelicals want to trust his stance on traditional marriage, Trump responded:

ÃÂI think they can trust me on traditional marriageÃÂ and frankly, I was very much in favor of having the court rule that it goes to states, and let the states decide. And that was a shocking decision for you and for me and for a lot of other people, but I was very much in favor of letting the states decide and thatÃÂs the way it looked it was going and then all of a sudden out of nowhere came this very massive decision and they took it away. But I was always in favor of stateÃÂs rights; states deciding.ÃÂ"	1
93	"WASHINGTON ÃÂ Americans in a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll rate the Affordable Care Act as President Obama's greatest achievement in the White House. Also, as his biggest failure.

In yet another sign of how polarized the United States remains, the signature initiative known as Obamacare draws the strongest praise from his supporters and the sharpest rebuke from his critics as Americans begin to consider how history will judge the nation's 44th president.

On one thing there is agreement across partisan lines: Six in 10 predict incoming president Donald Trump will significantly dismantle Obama's legacy. Three-fourths of Democrats call that a bad thing; three-fourths of Republicans call it a good one.

""The impression he pushed was that he wanted to undo everything on Day One, somehow, miraculously,"" says Megan Glidewell, 37, a college counselor from Waconia, Minn., who voted for Hillary Clinton. She was among those called in the poll. ""I know that's not how it works, but it certainly felt like what he wanted and what the people who voted for him wanted.""

About a third of those surveyed say Obama ultimately will be seen as a ""good"" president; 18% say he'll be a ""great"" one. But one in four say history will rate him as only ""fair,"" and another one in four say he'll be seen as a ""failed"" president.

President Obama's final weeks in office
The split by party is predictably stark: 86% of Democrats say Obama will be judged to have been a good or great president; 83% of Republicans say he will be seen as a fair or failed one.

""There was a lot of hope but a lot of under-delivery with him,"" says David Ockrim, 30, who operates a Yankee Doodle Dandy food truck in New York City.

""A total failure,"" scoffs Stephen Spence, 69, of Mesa, Ariz. ""On the economy, on immigration, on helping people from other countries that are fighting ISIS.""

""I think history would judge him well, but it's probably going to take a while,"" says Queen Jones, 73, a retired teacher's assistant from Mount Pleasant, N.C. ""I think he'll be judged well because of what he inherited when he came in and where the economy is right now.""

The poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken Wednesday through Sunday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

TrumpÃÂs vow to undo Obama rules? Not so fast
Trump is within his rights to use executive power, Obama says
Overall, Obama is leaving office with healthy ratings. By 55%-40%, Americans have a favorable opinion of him. That's much better than Trump's ratings, which remain underwater by 5 points ÃÂ 41% favorable, 46% unfavorable ÃÂ although the president-elect's standing has been improving. Just before Election Day, in late October, Trump was at 31% favorable, 61% unfavorable in the USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll.

Fifty-four percent now approve of the job Obama is doing as president.

When it comes to ranking his greatest achievements as president, close to one in four cite the Affordable Care Act. Nearly as many, 22%, name the economy's recovery after the Great Recession.

""If you look at the long-term history of the country, George W. Bush left him, frankly, with a pile of"" trouble, says Kathleen Hoynes, 56, of Upper Gwynedd, north of Philadelphia, using an expletive and crediting Obama with rescuing the economy. That said, she went on, ""I did not agree with a lot of what he did in not getting out of war and on race relations. He didn't do enough.""

Indeed, dealing with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ranks second on the list of Obama's failures, and handling race relations is third. It was cited by 15% of whites and 13% of blacks. As the nation's only African-American president, expectations were high that his election represented a breakthrough in race relations.

The Affordable Care Act was cited by 27% on the list of his biggest failures, nearly twice as many as any other issue."	0
94	"I like authenticity, especially as compared to survey-tested or heavily spun. I am prepared to let a candidate say something that I donÃÂt completely agree with and still support him or her. I think the need to be politically correct has gone too far. I also think the media often hypes and slants stories to the point of being untruthful.

I think a prosperous middle class is the key to the American success story, both economically and politically, and that lobbyists have way too much sway. I am very much a pragmatist, so much so that I like compromise more than I like ideology. I like deals, especially those that are win-win. 

So Donald Trump is my candidate, right? He is NOT!

In 1987, when I was 35 years old and he was 41, Donald Trump hired me to be his attorney on a major northern New Jersey project, a shopping center, which like everything else, was to bear his name, Trump Centre. It was a big deal that he picked me and a high honor for me just a couple of years after I started my law firm, which is now over 30 years old. This was at a time when Trump still built things, having recently finished Trump Tower. 

[IÃÂll never forget when] my married client sought to regale me with the number and quality of eligible young women who in his words ÃÂwant me.ÃÂ
He seemed to me smart, business savvy, decisive. He had a very impressive office, a fancy and very big boat, an airline, a helicopter shuttle and several casinos. Within a few years, virtually all of this would be lost because of bad business decisions. Lots of lawyers have worked for Donald Trump; lots and lots. I am no Roy Cohn ? neither as aggressive nor (hopefully) nearly as ethically-challenged ? but I did know well how to get very tough land use matters through an always challenging application process in New Jersey. I was thrilled when he hired me.

After the initial interview, my client contact with Donald was actually not very much. One low point I do remember (actually will never forget) is a limousine ride to a meeting with the editorial board of a New Jersey newspaper in which my married client sought to regale me with the number and quality of eligible young women who in his words ÃÂwant me.ÃÂ I was just plain shocked and embarrassed, but I kept smiling. I wanted and needed this client happy. 

While I was working for Donald, various press reports had Trump and his then-wife Ivanna living in a personal apartment in the Trump Tower of 8, 16 and even 20 or 30 rooms. Genuinely curious, I once asked him how many rooms the apartment actually had. I will never forget his response to me: ÃÂHowever many they will print.ÃÂ

Donald Trump was then, as he is now, larger than life, particularly in his own eyes, and at the same time frighteningly small, with very little moral grounding. He was then, and still is, all ego and show. 

I once asked him how many rooms [his] apartment actually had. I will never forget his response to me: ÃÂHowever many they will print.ÃÂ
I have thought about this a lot, and I want to share my humble insights of why we cannot elect Donald Trump as president of the United States. To me, it is more about character than politics. Because of lack of the former, the latter ? the actual politics of Donald Trump ? are not that easy to discern.

Once I got going with my reasons why Donald would not be good for our country, it was hard to stop. I did stop, however, when I hit 20, about 4,000 words from here. Read on if you are interested.

1. The man lies all the time.

Like the skilled liar he is, he does it with impunity. ÃÂI watched in Jersey City, NJ when thousands and thousands of people were cheering as the World Trade Center collapsed.ÃÂ ÃÂThe last quarter the gross domestic product was less than zero.ÃÂ ÃÂThe number of illegal immigrants in the United States is 30 million, it could be 34 million.ÃÂ ÃÂ The Mexican government forces bad people into our country.ÃÂ ÃÂThe unemployment rate may be as high as 42 percent.ÃÂ 

All these things have been said by Donald, actually often yelled by him, and many times over and over in front of large crowds. How about the whopper, ÃÂCrime statistics show blacks kill 81 percent of white homicide victimsÃÂ? One has to wonder why this lie would be conceived, much less told. Donald Trump says all of these things forcefully, so they must be true. But they are not! 

Unambiguously, they are what is described as ÃÂpants on fireÃÂ untruthful, as in, not a shred of truth. In passing, you have to ponder whether yet another of Donald TrumpÃÂs oft made statements about the fervor of his Christianity and the Bible being his favorite book are also not grounded in truth. Clearly, ÃÂthou shall not lieÃÂ is not his favorite of the Ten Commandments.

2. It is actually not all about the candidate.

ÃÂItÃÂs amazing how often I am right?ÃÂ ÃÂI alone can fix this.ÃÂ ÃÂI have a big brain.ÃÂ ÃÂI advise myself.ÃÂ ÃÂI am very, very rich.ÃÂ 

Donald really said all these things. His ego seems to know no bounds. When Donald feels insulted by someone, he obsesses without control. He fusses, he fumes, and he says unbelievably inappropriate things. He is in his glory when he can bully his way to a result he covets.

His ego seems to know no bounds. When Donald feels insulted by someone, he obsesses without control.
Did you ever notice that those real people stories other candidates are always telling about someone they just met, struggling with a difficult problem, are just not in the Trump lexicon? He keeps telling us he is all about winners. I guess these folks donÃÂt qualify. Said another way, Donald Trump doesnÃÂt play well in the sandbox with others.

First, he has his own ideas as to who can be in the sandbox with him. He also wants to run the sandbox. He is the kid who gets his way or stomps off in a huff. What happens when he figures out, even our nationÃÂs highest office is not all about him? Do we want him with the codes to nuclear weapons?

3. U.S. presidents are by design not kings. 

The Constitution makes them share power. Donald Trump who uses the ÃÂIÃÂ word more than anyone who has ever aspired to the job, has a brazenly authoritarian bent. He wants to be a ÃÂstrongman,ÃÂ not a president. 

One has to wonder what would happen if he actually had to govern or make one of his deals in a zero sum world of politics where the other side just says no. What then of his notoriously short attention span, temper or non-stop need to tweet his every frustration?

4. The devil IS in the details.


JONATHAN DRAKE / REUTERS
Donald Trump holds a sign supporting his plan to build a wall between the United States and Mexico that he borrowed from a member of the audience at his campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina March 9, 2016.
ÃÂWinning so much we will get tired of winning,ÃÂ ÃÂMake good deals with China,ÃÂ or even ÃÂMake America great againÃÂ are slogans that donÃÂt actually say anything. We are not stupid; share some details with us, so we can figure out whether you know what you are talking about. For Donald, however, in the few instances when specifics do follow, like perhaps the 1,000-mile, 35-55 foot wall or the deportation of 11 million immigrants, the details never come.

Never are we told that to build the wall, even to the lower 35 feet, (by actual construction estimates) would cost $25 billion dollars, even if you could get the land to build it (most of the border Trump wants to wall is in the middle of a river and land in many cases could not even be secured for a fence).

His magic to make Mexico pay for it? The only suggestion I have heard is take it out of remittances from folks mailing money back home or one of his ÃÂ45 percent tariffs.ÃÂ How is that going to work for the Americans sending the money to relatives or all of us paying 45 percent more for Mexican-made merchandise or the American company doing the manufacturing? How about the fact that the wall would do little to stop illegal immigration, more of which is ÃÂoverstaysÃÂ of visitors than ÃÂover the borderÃÂ and likely will generate few, if any, jobs for the folks Trump has whipped up into a xenophobic frenzy. 

Then letÃÂs take the deportation and just focus on the big stuff. How exactly do you round up and deport 11 million people? Is he going to use stadiums and nationalize cruise ship lines? Who will be doing the rounding up, certainly not the police, the army perhaps? The children left behind? How about the fact that American farms, restaurants, not to mention landscaping and construction labor jobs will go unattended? Vital jobs for sure, but are these the jobs that Trump plans to provide for his ÃÂreal AmericansÃÂ to make America great again?

5. Words matter.

Everything is not a ÃÂdisaster,ÃÂ ÃÂstupidÃÂ or a ÃÂdisgrace.ÃÂ Neither is it ÃÂtremendous,ÃÂ ÃÂhuge,ÃÂ ÃÂfantasticÃÂ or ÃÂamazing.ÃÂ Everyone is not a ÃÂloser,ÃÂ ÃÂlow energyÃÂ or a ÃÂbimbo.ÃÂ Talk of former presidents being liars ? or his favorite, ÃÂa disasterÃÂ ? and foreign dictators being great leaders does not advance the discourse. 

Americans are mostly not prudes, but vulgarity from the dais, penis size allusions, reveling in sexual conquests, menstruation-based criticism and crass insults of every shape and form just does not cut it from a president. We have children.


6. Reading is good. So is studying.

Donald Trump recently told us that he does not read much. We know from the recent revelations by Tony Schwartz, his ghost writer on The Art of the Deal (yes, I do have my copy from when it first came out, autographed with Donald telling me to ÃÂkeep up the great workÃÂ), which Donald says is second only to the Bible as the must-read book, that he certainly has not written a book ? at least not that one.

It is a special and unique form of arrogance to think you could even consider being literally the leader of the free world without doing the work to deeply understand the job.
Even though for many years I owned a bookstore and would not let my kids watch TV on weekdays to help them become readers, I do not believe you must read to lead. I do believe, however, that those who seek to lead us need to study hard, seek to gain wisdom from others, and try to master very complex ideas and relationships. I think being president is hard. I am glad that after a long day, President Obama retreats to his private study almost every night for 3 or 4 hours of quiet study... and reading. 

Any fair interpretation of TrumpÃÂs many bizarre statements and flip-flops makes it clear he has not the slightest inclination to read or study. In his own words, he makes decisions ÃÂwith very little knowledge other than the knowledge I already had, plus the words ÃÂcommon sense,ÃÂ because I have lots of common sense and I have a lot of business ability.ÃÂ It is a special and unique form of arrogance to think you could even consider being literally the leader of the free world without doing the work to deeply understand the job. 

7. The new vocabulary we are adjusting to is not a good one.

Xenophobe (intense dislike or fear of people from foreign countries); misogynist (strong prejudice against women); nativist (preference for established inhabitants as opposed to immigrants); fascist (authoritarian and dictatorial); bigot (intolerance for those with a different opinion); demagogue (inflaming passions based on popular desires not on rationale arguments); dystopian (describing a place, typically totalitarian, where everything is unpleasant and squalid); racist (oh, you know what this one is). 

We have all had to get the dictionary out to understand many of the not household terms that had to find their way into print to describe the unique phenomenon that is Donald Trump. The scary thing is that these strange words are at least close to the mark. What happened to statesmanlike, well-qualified, or even brilliant, as words we can use to describe people we want to elect to high office? HavenÃÂt heard any of these associated with the Donald.

8. We need to be careful with ÃÂtough.ÃÂ


Donald Trump said of a protester at one of his rallies, ÃÂin the good old days they would have carried him out on a stretcher.ÃÂ His world reveres this brand of toughness. This toughness is not about the strength it takes to use restraint or to make really hard decisions. It is about ÃÂpunching that guy in the face,ÃÂ or at a minimum, saving face ? his. 

I will resist the temptation to belabor the nuclear codes point again, and rather just query do we really want a thin-skinned president who, as he suggested, if a government leader (Castro) was not on the tarmac to meet his plane, ÃÂwould turn around Air Force One and come home.ÃÂ Or one who when confronted with the fact that whether or not his careless re-tweet of a white supremacist-created Jewish star and dollar bill-backed attack of Hillary Clinton was anti-Semitic, canÃÂt even just give one of those non-apology-apologies, ÃÂI am sorry if I offended anyone.ÃÂ A ÃÂtough-guyÃÂ who instead declares major newscasters stupid and sick and makes it all about the media who dare to criticize him, with never a word to David Duke and the ugly element high-fiving him and resending his initial offensive post. 

Whether or not the post was intended to even more firmly entrench this segment of support, Trump demonstrates his version of tough, one that glorifies his opinion and his being right over all else. Nowhere in his world can tough be humble, respectful, restrained or diplomatic.

9. Success does matter.

Donald TrumpÃÂs business success is greatly exaggerated and his skills limited. Donald Trump is a great salesman and a showman/promoter in a league only with PT Barnum. This we can give him. He has also been very good at making his name a brand and selling its use. For a while, he had some pretty high TV ratings by telling out of work celebrities they were fired. However, even in his own playing field, ask any large New York real estate developer, of whichÃÂsurprise, surpriseÃÂhe is not one, at least not as to large (14th in New York City on the latest list), and you will learn his successes are few. 

Four business bankruptcies (1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009), the Plaza Hotel, Trump Air, all three casinos (a couple times) the steaks, the water, Trump Centre in New Jersey that I worked on, ManhattanÃÂs West Side rail yards (where buildings do bear his name as a consolation), the much-hyped $35,000 get-rich scheme Trump University ? all failures by any measure except of course to Donald, who ÃÂhas no regrets, whatsoever.ÃÂ

Then there are basic business ethics: 3,500 lawsuits, the fact that he has penchant for not paying bills fully or on time, or that he calls himself the ÃÂKing of DebtÃÂ ? a king made rich by running up debt, then renegotiating it. Is this the skill set we want for the president?

Even with TrumpÃÂs fabled net worth, always exaggerated by billions more than others calculate, one has to wonder if his true net worth wouldnÃÂt be just as much if he took his considerable inheritance from father Fred and just passively invested it. WeÃÂll never know from Donald ? certainly not from those tax returns he wonÃÂt release.

10. We could not be the great country we are without the First Amendment, but our media may kill us.

The media is not DonaldÃÂs enemy as he keeps announcing from the stage. It may be the enemy of the rest of us, however. It sure feels like it lately. The air time Donald gets, and his ability to phone in his rants (especially with the cable media) is nothing short of, to use one of his words, ÃÂdisgusting.ÃÂ 

Donald, who lives by polls and ratings, understands it is ratings and not news worthiness that dictates what is on the airwaves. Donald dominates almost every news cycle, simply by being more outrageous than anyone or anything else. The ÃÂfalse equivalencyÃÂ created by point-counterpoint talking heads then makes over-the-top positions seem legitimate. It is reality TV writ large and it is very out of control.

11. Temperament, demeanor and character are important.

In many ways, Donald represents the very worst in all of us, or at least many of us. He is all about continuous gratification. He is the petulant child who wants his way. He is the selfish teenager with no big picture yet. He is the spoiled young man of privilege with the ÃÂrightÃÂ race and religion, education, good looks, and family fortune to succeed easily, and who looks down on others lacking in any of the above who do not.

He is the spoiled young man of privilege with the ÃÂrightÃÂ race ... and family fortune to succeed easily and who looks down on others lacking in any of the above who do not.
He is a man who thinks it is okay to call someone fat or ugly or stupid or to make fun of a person with a disability. He is the collector of trophy wives and trophy properties, the guy who wins, or so he thinks, because he has the most toys. 

12. The emperor and his clothes.

Donald says he knows more about the military than anyone else. Why? Because he went to an expensive prep school where they wore uniforms and sometimes marched? How about, ÃÂI know more about ISIS than the generals.ÃÂ Please, can some real soldiers evaluate this?

Donald says America never wins anymore. Compared to whom, and at what? No doubt we have problems. Democracy is messy. Witness the present campaign, and the long slow recovery from the 2008 recession has not included the middle class nearly enough. And, yes, trade in a world that is now fully connected and integrated is hard to figure out. But by what measure is America, as Donald tells us, a ÃÂdisasterÃÂ?

How do you actually say and believe, ÃÂThis country is a hell-hole. We are going down fast.ÃÂ Compared to whom? Mexico, China or his most bizarre new favorite, Russia, that he tells us ÃÂbeat us all the time ... because our leaders are stupidÃÂ? Give us a break. 

13. Sophomoric speech tricks donÃÂt work ? at least not with most of us.

Says Donald, ÃÂI am not going to talk aboutÃÂ the libertarian VP candidateÃÂs alcoholism. ÃÂI refuse to say... I cannot stand to say... that I cannot stand the sound of Clinton screaming into the microphone all the time.ÃÂ You just did, Donald. We get it that with these statements, even you know you are on shaky ground so you are trying to play it both ways. DoesnÃÂt work. Nor does your even more insidious, not-so-clever trick of attributing to others wild accusations that even you are afraid to make, but that you want to advance. 

How about when discussing the Orlando massacre, ÃÂthere are a lot of people that think [President Obama] doesnÃÂt want to get it. A lot of people think maybe he doesnÃÂt want to know about it I happen to think he just doesnÃÂt know what he is doing, but there are many people that think maybe he just doesnÃÂt want to get it. He doesnÃÂt want to see whatÃÂs really happening. And that could be.ÃÂ 

Who are these ÃÂpeopleÃÂ who have placed the president on the side of the terrorists? Perhaps the same people who, with Trump, saw the masses in New Jersey celebrating the destruction of the twin towers, or those convinced Hillary Clinton murdered Vince Foster, that Ted CruzÃÂs father was working with Lee Harvey Oswald to kill President Kennedy, or that President Obama was not born in the United States nor did he graduate from Harvard or Columbia. 

Two possibilities. The likely one: ÃÂlots of people are sayingÃÂ is just Trump code for ÃÂI want to now float something so outrageousÃÂ even red-faced Donald canÃÂt get it out without this qualifier. Or perhaps the ÃÂlots of peopleÃÂ is a select group, the closed loop of the loyalists who attend his rallies that heard it from him! 

14. A thin skin does not work for a president.

ÃÂThe politicians have again chosen this presidential pigmy as their nominee.ÃÂ So said the long-defunct New York Herald about Abraham Lincoln, now nearly everybodyÃÂs choice for our nationÃÂs best president. Consider the statement when George Washington left office: ÃÂthe time is now arrived for the source of all misfortune of our countryÃÂ [to be] reduced to a level with his fellow citizens.ÃÂ

U.S. presidents, all of them, have had their critics, and in our land of wonderful free speech, the critics get to have their say. Thank goodness. That Donald does not do well with criticism is not really open to debate. Ask Megyn Kelly (ÃÂthird-rate talentÃÂ), Rosie OÃÂDonnell (ÃÂnice little fat Rosie,ÃÂ ÃÂtotal loserÃÂ) or Elizabeth Warren (ÃÂPocahontasÃÂ) or for that matter virtually any of his recently vanquished adversaries: Cruz, Kasich, Rubio or Bush, in just the first tier. Even the one most like him (now apparently looking for a post-New Jersey job with him), Chris Christie felt his sting when he suggested Donald was ÃÂthin-skinned.ÃÂ He just canÃÂt let anything go ever. He obsesses even when he wins. 

Republicans who broke ÃÂthe pledgeÃÂ to support him, they ÃÂshould not be allowed to run for office again.ÃÂ In DonaldÃÂs world, disagreeing with him has to have a consequence ? a serious one ? and pursuing this goal is worthy of effort and energy, even when it makes no difference. 

Do we really think our president has time for this? Do we really want a man with such sensibilities and such an authoritarian bent in charge of, say, the FBI or the IRS? Does the concept of ÃÂsecret police,ÃÂ a favorite of leaders of this type elsewhere, seem too extreme? Probably, yes. But if I was Donald, I would float it with one of his ÃÂpeople are sayingÃÂ declarations. There, I just used his trick. See how easy it is. 

15. Bullies will always exist somewhere, but the White House should not be that somewhere.

What does a bully do? Most of all he or she seeks to intimidate, physically or at least verbally. So far this character trait of DonaldÃÂs has been exclusively verbal and aimed at business adversaries and more recently politicians and journalists ? and, of course, then ex-ghost writer of his book and ex-employees or contractors he cheated (those who do not have anti-disparagement contractual handcuffs) who dare to candidly assess his conduct. 

What happens when this guy gets the worldÃÂs strongest army at his disposal, and a bully pulpit that guarantees him notice? Seem like a bad idea to anyone else?

16. Law and order.

Before it was an Emmy-winning TV show, ÃÂlaw and orderÃÂ was a campaign theme used by Richard Nixon in 1968 to get himself elected in a year when our country had two very public assassinations and destructive demonstrations, even riots, in 110 U.S. cities. Nixon sought to mobilize what he called the ÃÂsilent majorityÃÂ around the need for more police. He also tapped into the racial and economic divide between black and white and working class and ÃÂelite Eastern liberals,ÃÂ and the evil media that his vice president, Spiro Agnew, called ÃÂnattering nabobs of negativism.ÃÂ Is Donald Trump seeking to bring this back? Of course yes, yet no.

Yes, he wants to separate and mobilize angry voters who feel left behind by an increasingly diverse culture. No, because his dystopian version of lawless, besieged, pitifully weak America is not what Nixon preached, nor for that matter Ronald Reagan. It is unique to him, at least in our country. It is, however, a textbook version of the rallying cry of countless dictators and strongmen. It is a demagogueÃÂs basic tool, to gin up a problem then declare he is the ÃÂonly one who can fix it.ÃÂ 

As bad as all this rhetoric is, what next? He tells us, ÃÂOn January 20, 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced... crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon?I mean very soon?come to an end.ÃÂ HowÃÂs this work, Donald? Martial law? Does he honestly believe President Obama, and for that matter all of his 44 predecessors, would not have liked to have all laws effective and fully followed? If only wishing could make it so! However, since the states, not the federal government, hold sway over most criminal law, the president acting alone has no Constitutional power to do any such thing. What then? More of the water boarding and killing families of terrorists logic? ÃÂI alone can fix it!ÃÂ

17. Incoherent rants, often contradictory, does not a foreign policy make.

Convince Japan and South Korea to seek nuclear arms. Eliminate NATO. Crush ISIS but do it without Muslim allies and no troops on the ground. Sometimes attack Libya, sometimes not. Sometimes attack surgically, but donÃÂt let it come out the way it did. Sometimes itÃÂs good we attacked Iraq, sometimes not. Do not nation build, but fix Syria. Stop Iran by making better deals. 

In fact, come to think of it, that is the solution to almost everything: ÃÂjust make better dealsÃÂ everywhere. Oh, yes and never apologize for anything. We are America, very, very rich and beholden to no one. Like us or else. Sound like someone we know? 

18. How will anyone effectively be president if we donÃÂt at least respect the office?

In the 1960s during an unpopular war, we all endured a president adorning himself with a flag pin and declaring anyone who did not agree with him (which include a heck of a lot of young people on campuses all across America, including me) somehow un-American. Although political opposition is as old as our nation, we begin to slide down the slope of dangerous disrespect when disagreement is replaced with vilification. 

This Republican nominee for the presidency thinks it is okay to accuse a former president of his own party of intentionally going to war on false pretenses and the current President of being in conspiracy with Muslim terrorists. Any thoughtful American of either party or no party, of any political philosophy must see that this must stop. 

Truth, or at least a semblance of some, has to come back. Outrageous lies just have no place in meaningful discourse ? outrageous liars even less so. They cannot become the backbone of a point-counterpoint talking-head media circus that is so much more about ratings than truth.

19. Rich and powerful guys have to play by the rules, too.

LetÃÂs not kid ourselves. Trump University was not an academic institution, far from it. It was a get-rich-quick scheme by a guy selling a get-rich-quick scheme. It is not the first or the last of its type. Late night, cheap-advertising-time-television will always feature this fare. DonaldÃÂs efforts, however, were on so much a grander scale ? $35,000... ÃÂa university.ÃÂ Really? What this was is an out-and-out fraud scheme by a man now trying to become the leader of our country and the free world. 

We all know, or at least have read, that suckers are born every minute. But canÃÂt we at least disrespect those who prey on these poor folks, and when they really go too far, sue them? ÃÂNo,ÃÂ says Donald Trump. The court case brought by a whole class of plaintiffs against his scam is only still in court, Donald says, because the long-time and distinguished federal judge is a ÃÂhaterÃÂ not capable of giving him justice because his parents are from Mexico.

In DonaldÃÂs world, the only individual capable of judging him would not be Mexican or related to anyone from Mexico, likewise folks of the Muslim faith, and, oh yeah, likewise women. In this world rich, entitled, egotistical, ethically-challenged older white men should then only be judged by rich, entitled, egotistical, ethically-challenged older white men.

20. We must stand for something.

Donald TrumpÃÂs version of America does not include folks not like him. Instead, he is all about what Sarah Palin labeled ÃÂreal Americans.ÃÂ The fact that all us others seem to be utterly expendable is deeply troubling. Targeting an entire religion ? Islam, with 1.6 billion adherents, 3.3 million being U.S. citizens ? for extra scrutiny or worse is patently inconsistent with traditional American values, if not those of the ÃÂreal Americans.ÃÂ

It is also unconstitutional, and, beyond all this, incredibly counterproductive as it hardens the lines of controversy by wholesale moving of the allies we need to solve terrorist problems into the enemy camp. Other similar strategies championed by Donald, like waterboarding and other forms of torture, not to mention targeting families of an enemy, are not just illegal. They are, to use another one of his words, ÃÂstupidÃÂ. They do not work, very likely making situations worse and our enemies more numerous and passionate.

One has to wonder, what does the America of the ÃÂreal AmericansÃÂ look like? A bunch of intolerant, hyper aggressive, folks behind a big wall, isolated (not trading with anyone and thus with a sick economy and very expensive goods) and with a lot of enemies. No ÃÂShining City on the Hill,ÃÂ for sure. Hard to see anything but ruin ahead for such a place.

We can do so much better! For me, better comes easily in the form of former Senator and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. For those who do not come to that conclusion easily (I get it), this year it will have to be the lesser of two evils. No matter what, donÃÂt even think about taking us into the abyss that is Donald Trump. "	0
95	"A war of words between Donald Trump and Bill Clinton escalated after the former president told a local newspaper that Trump ""doesn't know much"" and blamed his wife's loss in the race for the White House on FBI Director James Comey and Russian hackers.

The president-elect took to his Twitter feed to respond Tuesday morning.

Clinton made the initial remarks last week to a group of people he ran into at a small bookstore in Westchester County, NY, including an editor at the Bedford-Pound Ridge Record Review, who published Clinton's comments.

""James Comey cost her the election,"" Clinton reportedly said, referring to Comey sending a letter to lawmakers just two weeks before the election about the finding of new emails the FBI said could be pertinent to an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server during her time as secretary of state. Clinton added, ""We were seven (percentage) points up"" in the polls and slated to win before Comey's announcement.

Two days before the election, Comey told members of Congress that the FBI found nothing new in the e-mails but Clinton maintained the damage had already been done.

In the reports of Clinton's stop at the bookstore, Clinton was characterized has having had taken a call from Trump after the election and described it as ""cordial."" On Tuesday afternoon, Clinton sought to clear up who initiated the phone call through his own Twitter feed:

Clinton was also asked at the book store if he thought Trump was a smart man. ""He doesn't know much. One thing he does know is how to get angry, white men to vote for him,"" Clinton reportedly responded. He had previously said he believed Russia was also to blame for releasing internal Democratic emails and documents that hurt his wife's election's prospects before Election Day.

""I've watched her battle through that bogus email deal and be vindicated at the end,"" Clinton said earlier this week. ""She fought through everything, and she prevailed against it all. But, you know, with the end we had the Russians and the FBI deal, which she couldn't prevail against that."""	0
96	"PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump is planning to meet with his incoming national security adviser in the aftermath of a rattling day of violence around the world.

Trump appeared to jump ahead of investigators in blaming Islamic terrorists for deadly incidents Monday in Turkey and Germany and vowing anew to eradicate their regional and global networks. He called the brazen shooting of RussiaÃÂs ambassador to Turkey ÃÂa violation of all rules of civilized order.ÃÂ He added that a ÃÂradical Islamic terroristÃÂ had assassinated the diplomat, Andrei Karlov.

Turkish authorities identified the gunman as Mevlut Mert Altintas, a member of AnkaraÃÂs riot police squad, and said he was later killed in a shootout with police. Altintas shouted in Turkish about the Syrian city of Aleppo and also yelled ÃÂAllahu akbar,ÃÂ Arabic for ÃÂGod is great.ÃÂ

President-elect Trump describes mission to fight terrorism
As for Berlin, where at least 12 people were killed and nearly 50 hurt when a truck plowed through a Christmas market, Trump said the Islamic State group ÃÂand other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad.ÃÂ A man held by German authorities after the violence was later released after a lack of evidence to connect him to the incident.

TrumpÃÂs meeting scheduled Wednesday with retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn will come a day after Flynn and several other members of the incoming national security team met with Vice President-elect Mike Pence in Washington. Aides said the meeting was planned before the acts of violence, though they were discussed.

The gathering with Pence included retired Gen. John Kelly, TrumpÃÂs nominee for head of the Department of Homeland Security; retired Gen. James Mattis, the pick for defense secretary; and Rex Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil and the intended nominee for secretary of state.

While Trump has assembled his Cabinet at a quick pace, the process to fill out top White House jobs has been slowed by infighting among advisers. Some of TrumpÃÂs earliest advisers have expressed concern to the president-elect himself that they are getting boxed out in favor of those more closely aligned with incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus, who has chaired the Republican National Committee.

Among those whose future is still in flux is Corey Lewandowski, TrumpÃÂs controversial first campaign manager who was fired after clashing with the president-electÃÂs family. On Monday, Lewandowski met with Jared Kushner, TrumpÃÂs influential son-in-law, and could still be offered a job in the administration, though potentially one that would keep him out of the West Wing - and away from the president.

The president-electÃÂs transition team has said it expects to announce some White House positions in the coming days.

Former FBI agent on how Berlin terror attack differs from Nice
Trump met Tuesday with candidates for his unfilled Cabinet positions, including prospective hires to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, a beleaguered agency that the Republican businessman has vowed to overhaul.

At Mar-a-Lago, TrumpÃÂs palatial Florida estate, the president-elect met with Luis Quinonez, who runs a company with military and health care ties and is said to be under consideration for VA secretary. He also interviewed Toby Cosgrove, the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, who was a top contender to replace Eric Shinseki when he resigned from the VA in 2014. Cosgrove later withdrew from consideration.

Trump repeatedly pledged during the campaign to fix the woes at the department and said he would ÃÂtake care of great veterans.ÃÂ But he also came under scrutiny for being slow in paying out money raised for veterans groups and for suggesting that ÃÂstrongÃÂ veterans donÃÂt need treatment for mental health problems.

Others said to be considered for the post include former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, Florida Rep. Jeff Miller and Pete Hegseth, an Army veteran and former CEO of Concerned Veterans for America.

Trump is also considering Jovita Carranza, who worked in President George W. BushÃÂs administration, as his choice for U.S. trade representative. She served as deputy administrator of the Small Business Administration under Bush.

With just a handful of Cabinet posts to fill, Trump is facing some criticism for a lack of diversity in his senior team, which currently includes no Hispanics. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials said Tuesday that it was ÃÂdeeply concernedÃÂ at the lack of Hispanics considered for top jobs. Carranza was a member of TrumpÃÂs Hispanic advisory council during the campaign.

Pence, meanwhile, met in Washington with former Texas state official Susan Combs, who served both as state agriculture commissioner and comptroller. Trump also needs to fill the Agriculture Department slot. Transition officials did not immediately confirm if Combs is up for that post."	0
97	"A federal judge in New York has unsealed the search warrant obtained by the FBI to search Anthony WeinerÃÂs computer for emails related to Secretary ClintonÃÂs private server.

The warrant was issued on Oct. 30, just two days after FBI Director James Comey had sent a letter to Congress revealing the possible existence of new emails related to the FBIÃÂs investigation into Hillary ClintonÃÂs use of a private email server.

The Department of Justice had previously announced that the investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information was closed, with a decision not to bring charges against anyone. ComeyÃÂs letter to Congress said the new emails were discovered as part of an unrelated investigation, but he did not name or give details about the other investigation.

FBI combs through Weiner's computer
According to the warrant, law enforcement officials had asked the judge to authorize the search of a silver Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series laptop computer. The warrant states that those officials had information indicating that there were thousands of emails on the laptop that could be related to the Clinton investigation.

The FBIÃÂs application for the search warrant said that the laptop had never been authorized for the storage or transmission of classified or national defense information and that a complete forensic analysis and review of the device would allow the FBI to determine whether classified information had been mishandled or if the device had been hacked. 

The warrant was unsealed after E. Random Schoenberg sued to unseal the search warrant. He made it clear he was not interested in the ÃÂunrelated investigationÃÂ and was only seeking the warrant for the emails related to Secretary Clinton.

Huma Abedin challenges the FBI
In deciding whether to unseal the warrant, the judge noted that Clinton ÃÂhas little remaining privacy interest in the release of her documents identify her as the subject of her investigation.ÃÂ

The Department of Justice initially opposed the unsealing, then withdrew its opposition and instead asked only that the documents be unsealed with certain redactions. The warrant was redacted to hide the identity of the subject of that other investigation ÃÂ who has been independently confirmed to be Anthony Weiner. The redactions also protect the identity of the law enforcement agents who worked on the case and applied for the warrant.

Lawyers for Huma Abedin filed a letter in the case saying that the government never provided Abedin or her estranged ex-husband Anthony Weiner with a copy of the warrant.

Under federal law the officer executing the warrant must give a copy to the person whose property is taken.  This case is slightly more complicated by the fact that the laptop had already been confiscated for the other investigation, a sexting scandal involving Weiner and a minor."	0

99	"Tuesday was supposed to be a day of triumph for Russian diplomacy, when Russia aimed to replace the United States as the indispensable power in the Middle East. Instead, it became a day of mourning, with a Turkish honor guard in Ankara loading the flag-draped coffin of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov onto a Moscow-bound plane.

Karlov, who was assassinated in an Ankara art gallery Monday evening, had been given the delicate mission of patching up relations after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane last year. On Tuesday, Karlov's efforts were to be crowned by a meeting in Moscow of the foreign and defense ministers of Russia, Turkey and Iran ÃÂ and the rise of a new power constellation in the Middle East.

Those talks went ahead despite his death. Afterward, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov declared the three-country format ""the most effective"" in resolving the Syrian conflict, since his talks with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had run aground. Last week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, accused Russia and Iran of bearing responsibility for ""atrocities"" committed during the Syrian government's assault on the city of Aleppo.

With a lame-duck administration in the White House for the next month, Russia is using territorial gains in Syria to seize the diplomatic initiative as well. Because the Syrian government's retaking of Aleppo has happened so fast, Lavrov agreed to move up the Moscow meeting with his Turkish and Iranian colleagues by a week.

That's why the reaction to Karlov's murder ÃÂ by an off-duty Turkish policeman who shouted about avenging the carnage in Aleppo before being shot to death himself ÃÂ was practically unanimous in Moscow. The official line from Russian President Vladimir Putin on down was that the assassination in Ankara was a ""provocation"" meant to derail the talks.


Members of a Turkish honor guard carry the coffin of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov at the airport in Ankara.

When Turkey shot down a Russian Su-24 warplane along the Turkey-Syria border in November 2015, Putin's response was fast and furious. Diplomatic and economic relations were put on hold until last summer, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan finally issued an apology.

On Monday, the blame in Moscow for the ambassador's killing was assigned to unnamed forces that are opposed to Russia and Turkey's rapprochement. Putin talked on the phone with Erdogan, who agreed to let in a team of Russian investigators.

Putin needs Erdogan, and Erdogan needs Putin. The two leaders are facing isolation from traditional partners because of their policies against domestic opponents and militant nostalgia for bygone empires. What to do about Syria ÃÂ once a bone of contention between Russia and Turkey ÃÂ has become an opportunity for both countries to act as power brokers in a global crisis.

The importance of that relationship is clear from the number of contacts the two countries have had since Erdogan's conciliatory visit to Russia back in August. In the space of the past month, Putin has been on the phone with Erdogan half a dozen times, and the Turkish leader is expected to travel to Russia again in January.

Just a little more than a year ago, Putin was accusing Erdogan of ""a stab in the back"" and estimated ISIS oil sales via Turkey in the hundreds of millions ÃÂ if not billions ÃÂ of dollars.

Now, responsibility for Karlov's assassination is being attributed to powers farther afield.

""Murder of our ambassador is continuation of information war against Russia. Media hysteria created conditions for it. Info attacks lead to terrorist attacks,"" Russian senator Alexei Pushkov tweeted on Tuesday.

Russian nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who happens to hold a degree in Turkish studies, didn't shy away from blaming the West directly.

""Turkey is turning away from the West. That's disadvantageous for certain Western intelligence agencies,"" Zhirinovsky said on state television Monday night.

The European Union and NATO are afraid that Russia will join forces with Iran and Turkey, he said, presenting the West with a formidable counterweight. So far, Karlov's efforts to that end have not been in vain."	0
100	"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (The Adobo Chronicles, Washington Bureau) ÃÂ Sources close to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) have confirmed to The Adobo Chronicles that the chosen theme for this yearÃÂs convention is ÃÂVote Your Conscience.ÃÂ

The theme reinforces the idea that it is ÃÂunconscionableÃÂ for any American to vote for Donald Trump.

And what better person to expound on this theme than former Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz.

Cruz emphasized this theme during his speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland earlier this week. He has been invited by DNC to speak just before Hillary Clinton delivers her nomination acceptance speech.  He has accepted.

Upon learning of the news, Trump accused Cruz of being a turncoat and a sore loser.  The senator from Texas refused to endorse Trump during his Cleveland speech, eliciting boos from the Republican crowd.

We caught up with Cruz on his way to Philadelphia and asked him if this meant he was voting for Clinton in November.  ÃÂI am still undecided, but I know that my wife Heidi Cruz will. In no way is she voting for a misogynist like Trump.ÃÂ

During the Republican primaries, Trump and Cruz became engaged in a personal war of words, with Trump sharing an unflattering picture of Heidi on Twitter."	1
101	"Labor Secretary Tom Perez called presidential transition questions sent to government agencies like the Energy department, seeking to identify employees who worked on climate change, against the law.

ÃÂThose questions have no place in a transition,ÃÂ Perez said. ÃÂThat is illegal.ÃÂ

DNC prepares to pick its next leader
Last week, President-elect TrumpÃÂs transition team sent the State Department a memo requesting information on its ÃÂgender-related staffing, programming, and funding.ÃÂ However, the document did not request specific names of employees working on those programs.

ÃÂWill dedicated career people be targeted because they were doing the right work?ÃÂ Perez said.

He said he isnÃÂt aware of any similar ÃÂblanket questionsÃÂ posed to the Labor Department.

The president-electÃÂs transition team responded to PerezÃÂs comments in statement saying ÃÂthe transition has a memorandum of understanding in place with the administration, and we continue to uphold both of our ends in this agreement.ÃÂ

President-elect Trump has nominated businessman Andy Puzder to replace Perez as head of the Labor Department. Puzder is CEO of CKE restaurants which owns the fast food chains HardeeÃÂs and CarlÃÂs Jr. He has argued against raising the minimum wage.

Perez is now running for Chair of the Democratic National Committee. He criticized the Democratic Party for neglecting ÃÂRust BeltÃÂ states, where Mr. Trump trounced Hillary Clinton.

ÃÂOrganizing canÃÂt consist of going to a church every four years in October and saying ÃÂvote for meÃÂ,ÃÂ Perez said.

President Obama nominated Perez as Labor Secretary in 2013. Perez championed Mr. ObamaÃÂs efforts to expand overtime pay to millions of Americans. A Texas judge blocked a Labor Department rule expanding overtime in November. But Perez is promising to focus on similar efforts if elected DNC Chair.

ÃÂYou donÃÂt have to lower wages in order to move forward. You can lift wages and lift prosperity for everybody.ÃÂ

Perez faces Minnesota Congressman Keith EllisonÃÂa favorite of some progressives, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and VermontÃÂs Sen. Bernie Sanders (I). Other names of potential DNC Chair challengers are also being floated.

Ellison is pushing to strengthen what he calls the ÃÂgrassrootsÃÂ of the party.

102	"President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Monday night to defend his charitable foundation, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, just two days after announcing he will dissolve it.

In the posts, Mr. Trump says he gave ÃÂmillions of dollarsÃÂ to the Trump Foundation. He also said that all of the money goes ÃÂto wonderful charities,ÃÂ a claim for which there is little to no evidence:

Despite Mr. TrumpÃÂs assertion that he has given ÃÂmillions of dollarsÃÂ to the Trump Foundation, news reports have indicated that Mr. Trump vastly oversells his charitable giving. And since he has not released his tax returns, itÃÂs impossible to verify how much money he has given to charity. 

According to the Washington Post, Mr. Trump has given only one traceable personal donation since 2008 -- for $10,000, to the Police Athletic League of New York City. As for the Trump Foundation, Mr. Trump has given $5.5 million to the group since its inception -- but has not contributed to it since 2008, meaning the organization has largely been funded by other people in recent years.

In addition, several reports have established that Mr. Trump used money from the foundation to help further his political interests. The Washington Post reported, for example, that Mr. Trump used foundation funds to settle legal disputes -- and even to buy two large portraits of himself, one of which hung on the wall of a Trump-owned golf resort. He paid a $2,500 fine to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) earlier this year after it was revealed that his foundation made a $25,000 political contribution that violated tax laws.

The series of tweets came just two days after Mr. Trump announced he would be shuttering the foundation in the wake of questions about possible conflicts of interest.

Mr. Trump said in a Christmas Eve statement that he has directed his counsel to begin taking steps toward dissolving the foundation; however, it cannot formally shut down until the New York state attorney generalÃÂs office completes its investigation of the foundation.

ÃÂTo avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways,ÃÂ Mr. Trump said in his statement.

Mr. TrumpÃÂs tweets about the Trump Foundation also came just hours after he insisted on Twitter that there was ÃÂno wayÃÂ President Obama could have beaten him in a hypothetical 2016 election between the two men, and criticized the United Nations for not living up to its ÃÂgreat potential.ÃÂ"	0
103	"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂFulfilling a promise that was a hallmark of his campaign, President-elect Donald J. Trump said on Thursday that on Day One of his Administration he would create jobs for two unskilled white males.

Appearing at a press conference flanked by the males, Trump assailed an economy that had left the two men behind.

ÃÂThese two guys are completely unskilled, unemployable, and angry,ÃÂ Trump said, as the two males glowered at the press corps. ÃÂI, and I alone, can create jobs for people like them.ÃÂ

Gesturing vehemently at the two men, Trump underlined his last point. ÃÂNo oneÃÂI repeat, no oneÃÂbut me is willing to give these two jobs,ÃÂ he said.

The two unskilled men profusely thanked Trump, and said that they had almost given up hope that anyone would ever hire them again.

Appearing on CNN, another unskilled white male, Corey Lewandowski, said that the two jobs Trump had created were ÃÂjust the beginning.ÃÂ

104	"OTTAWA ÃÂ In a symbolic gesture aimed at demonstrating the ÃÂshared valuesÃÂ she hopes will serve as the foundation of strong diplomatic relations between her party and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Conservative leadership hopeful Kellie Leitch has borrowed the former reality TV starÃÂs beloved dog whistle.

ÃÂMr. TrumpÃÂs victory is a call to arms for Old Stock Canadians whoÃÂve been silenced for too long by the oppressive decency and tolerance of PC culture,ÃÂ the Simcoe-Grey MP said in a statement. ÃÂThis country is supposed to be the Great White North, and by following our American neighborsÃÂ example, I am confident we can take our country back from the global elites whoÃÂve perverted our traditional family values with their barbaric cultural practices. And you know who IÃÂm talking about.ÃÂ

ÃÂBut just in case you donÃÂt, I mean kikes, dykes, fags, and head rags. ÃÂSorry, IÃÂve never used one of these before.ÃÂ

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for TrumpÃÂs transition team said that, while the President-elect appreciates LeitchÃÂs ham-fisted attempts to blow the same dog whistle that propelled him to his stunning victory, the fact remains that ÃÂMr. Trump has no interest whatsoever in a woman over 40 blowing anything.ÃÂ

105	"As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to be sworn in as the country's commander-in-chief next month, a majority of Americans say they are either uncertain or pessimistic about his presidency, even as the country is sounding a more optimistic tone about the future of the economy and Trump's ability to bring positive change to Washington D.C.

A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds 54 percent of adults saying that they are either uncertain (25 percent) or pessimistic and worried (29 percent) about how Trump will perform during his presidency, compared with 45 percent with either an optimistic and confident view (22 percent) or a satisfied and hopeful view (23 percent).

That's a significantly worse outlook than Americans expressed after the elections of both Barack Obama and George W. Bush. A combined 66 percent were either optimistic or hopeful about Obama in January 2009, according to the same poll, while 59 percent were optimistic or hopeful about George W. Bush in January 2001.


The data show the extent to which the nation remains unusually divided even though Election Day is in the rearview mirror, said Democratic pollster Fred Yang of Hart Research Associates, which conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his firm Public Opinion Strategies.

""Usually elections settle arguments and the nation comes together, at least in the short term,"" Yang said. ""Today, hard feelings persist on both sides of the partisan divide. It's as if the 2016 campaign has never ended.""

Those partisan differences are particularly stark when it comes to public approval ratings of the way Trump is handling his transition. Half of the country overall gives Trump high marks so far, compared to 41 percent who give him a thumbs down. But among Hillary Clinton's voters, only 12 percent approve of how he's handling the transition, compared to 92 percent of Trump voters.

Back in 2008, 50 percent of John McCain's voters approved of Barack Obama's handling of his presidential transition, and in 1992, 63 percent of George H.W. Bush's voters backed Bill Clinton's early moves as president-elect.


The partisan divide extends to views about the men and women Trump has selected to lead his administration. Seventy-eight percent of Democrats say they are disappointed with the administration appointments Trump has made so far, while 80 percent of Republicans say they are generally pleased with Trump's picks.

While Trump's overall favorability has ticked up modestly since before the election, he remains underwater, with more Americans giving him a poor rating (46 percent) than a positive one (40 percent.)

That marks the first time that an incoming president has been viewed more negatively than positively in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll.

Some bright spots -- but ones mostly driven by enthusiasm from Trump's supporters

While the public is largely apprehensive about the president-elect, Americans do say that they are more optimistic that the U.S. economy will improve in the next year. Forty-two percent say they believe the economy will get better - the highest share since autumn of 2012 -- while only 19 percent say the economy will get worse in the next year.

Trump has also generated relatively positive feelings about his ability to change the federal government for the better. A majority of Americans say Trump will shake up the way government operates - and, among that group, they believe that he'll bring the right kind of change by a two-to-one margin (41 percent to 20 percent).

Additionally, a majority - fifty-six percent - say they are optimistic that Trump will keep U.S. jobs from going overseas.


Still, the confidence about Trump's presidency is mostly fueled by enthusiasm among his base voters rather than by more hopeful expectations among those who didn't choose him on their ballot in November.

A whopping 92 percent of Trump voters are optimistic about his ability to bring change to Washington, while just 20 percent of Clinton voters say the same. The same share of Trump voters - 92 percent - say they are hopeful that Trump will look out for those who are struggling in today's economy, while only nine percent of Clinton voters agree.


Those who say that the economy will get better in the next year rather than worse include key Trump constituency groups like whites (49 percent better compared to 15 percent worse), Republicans (68 percent better to six percent worse), and men (46 percent better to 15 percent worse.) Among Democrats, 33 percent believe the economy will get worse compared to 19 percent who believe it will improve, and just 22 percent of African Americans think the economy will improve compared to a third who say it will deteriorate.

The public also still harbors concerns about Trump's temperament. Just 36 percent of Americans say they are optimistic that Trump has the right temperament to be president, while 44 percent say they are worried about the issue.

The Republican Party gets a boost - but will it last?

In the wake of the 2016 election, the Republican Party now has a higher net favorability rating (35 percent positive, 38 percent negative) than the Democratic Party (34 percent positive, 42 percent negative). That's the first time since after the 2010 midterms that Republicans have scored better on the favorability measure than their Democratic counterparts.

But it's not clear that Americans' warmer feelings toward the GOP will endure. After its previous high watermark six years ago, the party's positive ratings quickly fell back to earth, with Democrats regaining the advantage the following month."	0
106	"When Donald Trump began his improbable run for president 15 months ago, he offered his wealth and television celebrity as credentials, then slyly added a twist of fearmongering about Mexican ÃÂrapistsÃÂ flooding across the Southern border.

From that moment of combustion, it became clear that Mr. TrumpÃÂs views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.

Now here stands Mr. Trump, feisty from his runaway Republican primary victories and ready for the first presidential debate, scheduled for Monday night, with Hillary Clinton. It is time for others who are still undecided, and perhaps hoping for some dramatic change in our politics and governance, to take a hard look and see Mr. Trump for who he is. They have an obligation to scrutinize his supposed virtues as a refreshing counterpolitician. Otherwise, they could face the consequences of handing the White House to a man far more consumed with himself than with the nationÃÂs well-being.

`Why Donald Trump Should Not Be President'I assume this is Part One.
SEE ALL COMMENTS
Despite his towering properties, Mr. Trump has a record rife with bankruptcies and sketchy ventures like Trump University, which authorities are investigating after numerous complaints of fraud. His name has been chiseled off his failed casinos in Atlantic City.

Mr. TrumpÃÂs brazen refusal to disclose his tax returns ÃÂ as Mrs. Clinton and other nominees for decades have done ÃÂ should sharpen voter wariness of his business and charitable operations. Disclosure would undoubtedly raise numerous red flags; the public record already indicates that in at least some years he made full use of available loopholes and paid no taxes.

Mr. Trump has been opaque about his questionable global investments in Russia and elsewhere, which could present conflicts of interest as president, particularly if his business interests are left in the hands of his children, as he intends. Investigations have found self-dealing. He notably tapped $258,000 in donorsÃÂ money from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits involving his for-profit businesses, according to The Washington Post.

A straight talker who tells it like it is?

Mr. Trump, who has no experience in national security, declares that he has a plan to soundly defeat the Islamic State militants in Syria, but wonÃÂt reveal it, bobbing and weaving about whether he would commit ground troops. Voters cannot judge whether he has any idea what heÃÂs talking about without an outline of his plan, yet Mr. Trump ludicrously insists he must not tip off the enemy.

Another of his cornerstone proposals ÃÂ his campaign pledge of a ÃÂtotal and complete shutdownÃÂ of Muslim newcomers plus the deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants across a border wall paid for by Mexico ÃÂ has been subjected to endless qualifications as he zigs and zags in pursuit of middle-ground voters.

Whatever his gyrations, Mr. Trump always does make clear where his heart lies ÃÂ with the anti-immigrant, nativist and racist signals that he scurrilously employed to build his base."	0
107	"U.S. Agency for International DevelopmentÃÂs (USAID) worked in Afghanistan from July 2008 through June 2015 under the Obama administration. The work there included supporting 30 Afghan health facilities. They spend nearly $260 million through the Partnership Contracts for Health Program.

The logic seems sounds, in a country at war; we can help by providing health care. Unfortunately, it seems that USAID is not accomplishing their tasks.

On the website, the USAID claims that during the current administration, ÃÂThe Agency began rebuilding with an eye to getting the most bang out of its funding allocations.ÃÂ This must be code for, ÃÂWe will take millions to build hospitals and lose them,ÃÂ because this is exactly what the group has done.

Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) John Sopko wrote to the agency, stating, ÃÂOne Afghanistan hospital funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development was located more than 430 miles away from the listed coordinates, while another 11 facilities were more than six miles away.ÃÂ

The letter elaborated, ÃÂSIGAR sought to conduct site inspections at 30 of 79 facilities in BadakhshanÃÂ ÃÂ an Afghan province ÃÂ but ÃÂwas unable to locate one facility. SIGAR found substantial inaccuracies in the geospatial coordinates USAID previously provided for many of these 29 health facilities and observed that not all facilities had access to electricity and drinking water.ÃÂ


The money to help is going somewhere elseÃÂ

Sopko went on to say that only 12 of the inspected facilities were located near the coordinates USAID provided. This means that only about 15% of the hospitals were in the places they were supposed to be.

In some cases, the coordinates given were not even in the correct country, ÃÂcoordinates for 22 of the 79 facilities were not located in the districts listed in the most recent information available to USAID. Coordinates for two health facilities were located in Pakistan; AfghanistanÃÂs neighboring country to the southeast.ÃÂ

One health facility was actually listed as being in the Mediterranean Sea by USAID. Others were miles from the reported coordinates, ÃÂfour were more than six miles away from their listed coordinates, and another three were between three and six miles away. Another six facilities were between just over a half mile and three miles away, while nine were actually located within about a half mile of their listed location.ÃÂ

It seems as though this has been an ongoing problem for USAID. ÃÂAs SIGAR has stressed previously, robust program oversight requires specific knowledge of the location where the service is provided,ÃÂ Sopko wrote to USAID Administrator Gayle Smith.

A USAID official reported that it would not bother correcting the problem, ÃÂThe agency no longer maintains location data and ÃÂobtaining it would require a specialized request to the Afghan government, which USAID was unwilling to make.ÃÂ

Sopko countered this statement, ÃÂÃÂUSAIDÃÂs position regarding its monitoring responsibilities is troubling. [W]e encourage USAID to request and maintain this information, in order to help ensure that funding spent to improve the health of specific populations is actually reaching the intended communities.ÃÂ

It would seem necessary for someone to step in and stop the funding to this program until it starts reporting correctly. Sopko emphasized the importance of this when he stated, ÃÂMaintaining accurate GPS data would help the USAID conduct site visits and help ensure that the intended communities receive needed health services.ÃÂ

Instead of taking a closer look at what is really happening, the agency will go on funding health centers, providing another $228 million for the facilities. In turn, the United States will keep funding USAID. The bizarre circle of corruption will continue.

USAID has clearly stated their intentions going forward, USAID ÃÂdoes not intend to maintain coordinates.ÃÂ They will instead rely on the World Bank and the Afghan government who are now handling the facilities.

Given this set of facts, the U.S. needs to withdraw its funding of the agency. Obama and liberals shown no signs that this will happen though.

The facilities that SIGAR Sopko was able to inspect were in poor condition. ÃÂ[W]e did observe some basic structural concerns at most of the facilities, such as cracked walls, leaking roofs, broken doors, and shattered windows,ÃÂ which ÃÂindicate clear concerns with sanitation and safety.ÃÂ  Inspectors also found ÃÂexposed wiring. Electrical deficiencies, such as exposed live wires, pose serious hazards that could endanger the safety of patients and staff.ÃÂ


Horrible conditions

This brings a chilling image of what kind of care the patients might be receiving. Liberals are not concerned that millions are disappearing into a bottomless pit.

Millions have gone to fund clinics that are either misplaced or in such disrepair that they should be closed. Millions more will be given before this funding runs out.

Why is nobody in Washington asking questions?

The answers will leave the White House with Obama. His dirty hands are all over this one as he stands in front of the American public and claims he is concerned, that the government is helping innocent citizens in the war torn country of Afghanistan.

As usual, this is all lies. A more likely scenario, given what we know now, is that he needed a reason to funnel money into the country and the facade of ÃÂhealth clinicsÃÂ was believable at the time.

No more money should be sent to any program that Obama has started overseas. His close ties to terrorists should raise red flags for every American.

President Trump needs to undo all of these  ÃÂprojectsÃÂ so that we no longer operate maliciously, negligently, or in a corrupt manner."	1
108	"A former top official at the country's third-largest pension fund and two broker-dealers were charged Wednesday in what a federal prosecutor described as a classic bribery scheme that steered $2 billion in trades in exchange for drugs, prostitutes, vacations and U.S. Open tennis tickets.

""The hard-earned pension savings of New Yorkers should never serve as a vehicle for corrupt, personal enrichment,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement, calling the alleged pay-for-play arrangement a ""classic, quid-pro-quo bribery scheme.""

Navnoor Kang, the ex-head of the $184 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund's fixed income trades, received more than $100,000 worth of bribes in the form of trips, gifts, luxury hotel stays and other payoffs from broker-dealers Deborah Kelley and Gregg Schonhorn, prosecutors said.

Kang, 38, was arrested in Portland, Oregon, on securities fraud, honest service wire fraud, conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges.

His attorney, Lauren DeSantis-Then, said her client denies all the charges.

""Mr. Kang is not guilty and we look forward to our day in court,"" she said.

Kelley, 58, of Piedmont, California, was expected to surrender, authorities said. Her attorney didn't immediately return a request for comment.

Schonhorn, 45, of Short Hills, New Jersey, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with federal authorities, court papers show. His lawyer didn't immediately return a request for comment.

Regulators found that Kang steered about $2 billion in fixed-income trades to firms represented by Kelley and Schonhorn beginning in early 2014, resulting in millions of dollars in commissions, of which the two earned between 35 and 40 percent, according to an indictment.

In that time, securities investigators found that the firms' fixed-income business surged, with one of them increasing its domestic bond transactions from zero at the end of fiscal year 2013 to $2.378 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016, making it one of the top broker dealers doing state pension fund business, according to the complaint.

Prosecutors said that in exchange, Kang received a $10,000 all-expenses-paid trip to Montreal, Canada; a ski trip to Park City, Utah; tickets to a Paul McCartney concert in New Orleans; a $17,420 Panerai wristwatch; dinners at upscale restaurants; nights out at strip clubs; prostitutes; and cocaine.

The state's pension fund has been the source of scandal before.

In 2010, a state comptroller pleaded guilty to charges he steered pension funds to a campaign contributor. Further investigations revealed investors' widespread use of so-called placement agents to access pension funds, an arrangement some regulators have likened to pay-to-play.

Kang had been fired in 2012 by a private investment firm for accepting gifts from Schonhorn in exchange for steering fixed-income business, but he lied about his termination when he was hired by the state fund, according to the complaint.

Asked whether state officials properly investigated Kang before hiring him, a spokesman for the comptroller's office said only that ""background checks are a routine part of the hiring process."""	0
109	"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂIn his first public statement since Donald Trump chose him to be the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Ben Carson said on Monday that the Bible ÃÂmakes absolutely no mention of housing or urban development.ÃÂ

Carson said that, when Trump initially asked him to accept the post, ÃÂthe first thing I did was check the Bible to see if there was anything about housing or urban development in there, and much to my dismay there was not.ÃÂ

ÃÂAs you can well imagine, I did not want to be in charge of something that the Bible does not condone,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂBut then I realized that perhaps the Lord wants me to take this job so that I can banish housing and urban development from the earth.ÃÂ

Carson offered no details about how he would eliminate housing, but said that he was seeking advice from TrumpÃÂs pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. ÃÂSheÃÂs basically trying to do the same thing with education,ÃÂ he said.

111	"Donald Trump appears to have not a clue how to lead a superpower.

That was the conclusion of ChinaÃÂs Global Times newspaper on Monday morning as the countryÃÂs media weighed in on the president-electÃÂs latest social media assaults on Beijing.


Don't let China ties slide into 'full conflict mode', Obama urges Trump
 Read more
ÃÂTrump is not behaving as a president who will become master of the White House in a month,ÃÂ the Communist party controlled newspaper wrote in an editorial. ÃÂHe bears no sense of how to lead a superpower.ÃÂ

The article came after the US president-elect again used Twitter, which has been blocked in China since 2009, to berate the leaders of the worldÃÂs second largest economy.

ÃÂChina steals United States Navy research drone in international waters ÃÂ rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented [sic] act,ÃÂ Trump tweeted early on Saturday morning after it emerged the Chinese navy had seized a US naval drone that had been operating in the South China Sea.

In a second tweet, Trump wrote:

Those 221 characters threatened to further alienate ChinaÃÂs rulers, already reeling from TrumpÃÂs recent decision to hold a 10-minute phone call with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, and threat to upend long-standing US policy on Taiwan.

On Friday, President Obama cautioned Trump against allowing relations with China slip into ÃÂfull conflict modeÃÂ.

In its editorial, the fervently nationalist Global Times, a state-run tabloid that sometimes reflects official thinking, indicated such a deterioration was certainly on the cards if Trump continued to act up.

People in China were unsure whether the billionaireÃÂs attacks on Beijing were part of attempts to wage a psychological war or simply an example of his amateurishness.

ÃÂBut if he treats China after assuming office in the same way as in his tweets, China will not exercise restraint,ÃÂ the newspaper warned. ÃÂThe Chinese government should be fully prepared for a hardline Trump.ÃÂ

In an online video that has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, the newspaperÃÂs controversial editor, Hu Xijin, said: ÃÂI donÃÂt know if he is playing the psychological card with China or is in fact just unprofessional ÃÂ China should teach him some lessons so he might learn to respect China after he is sworn in.ÃÂ

A comment piece on the front page of the overseas edition of the Communist partyÃÂs official mouthpiece, the PeopleÃÂs Daily, also suggested Beijing would not be cowed by TrumpÃÂs provocations.

ÃÂIt is difficult to understand his true psychology,ÃÂ wrote Hua Yiwen, whom the paper described as an international affairs expert. ÃÂBut China shouldnÃÂt spend much effort trying to guess what he is thinking. We should simply stand firm, take control of the situation and handle it calmly.ÃÂ

Bill Bishop, a Washington DC-based China expert, said he sensed ÃÂabject despairÃÂ in the US capital at how Trump was conducting US-China relations through misspelled tweets.

ÃÂThis is unpresidented behaviour by a precedent-elect,ÃÂ joked Bishop. ÃÂIt would be funny if the stakes werenÃÂt so high.ÃÂ


China should plan to take Taiwan by force after Trump call, state media says

ÃÂThis is not a business deal. This is a political relationship between nuclear powers who are already on the path towards conflict in several dimensions,ÃÂ added Bishop, who publishes the influential Sinocism newsletter.

ÃÂThis kind of uncertainty, this kind of petulance, this kind of random tweeting ÃÂ is not a grand strategy that is going to push the Chinese on to their heels so they are going to make concessions. This is juvenile, immature, inexperienced behaviour that has the potential to lead to many problems in the US-China relationship, some of which could have some pretty serious and damaging ramifications.ÃÂ

Bishop questioned the Chinese mediaÃÂs suggestion that TrumpÃÂs tweets were part of a wily psychological ploy to force trade concessions from Beijing. ÃÂI wouldnÃÂt ascribe brilliant psychological warfare skills to Donald Trump,ÃÂ he said.

Was it possible TrumpÃÂs tweets were part of an ingenious new master plan for Sino-US relations that would emerge after his inauguration on 20 January? Bishop was skeptical.

ÃÂI think that is about as likely as Xi Jinping waking up on 1 December, 2017 and declaring China a democracy.ÃÂ"	0

Before agreeing to the interview, Bornstein pleaded for the reporter to leave him alone. ÃÂPlease stop this nonsense!!!ÃÂ he said in an email.
On having second thoughts about the interview being published afterward: ÃÂI happen to have known the Sulzbergers [the family that owns the New York Times] for 50 years. IÃÂm going to make sure you donÃÂt ever work again if you do this.ÃÂ
Trump isn't ÃÂan old man the way my grandfather was an old man.ÃÂ But Hillary Clinton: ÃÂSheÃÂs an old lady. SheÃÂs an old lady. ItÃÂs funny, isnÃÂt it?ÃÂ
On his son volunteering to work for Trump's campaign: ÃÂWhat a great experience, for an 18-year-old to go to Trump Tower in a presidential year, with this character, of all people.ÃÂ
Bornstein, in case you haven't noticed, is kind of like Trump, if Trump were less rich and an eccentric gastroenterologist. Witness this anecdote:

The back of his business cards are written in Italian, with the phrase ÃÂdottore molto famoso,ÃÂ or ÃÂvery famous doctor,ÃÂ below his name. (For 10 years, he took private Italian lessons from women he found through Craigslist postings, paying them about $60 an hour for weekly sessions, he said.) A photograph of his psychoanalyst hangs in his office. As this reporter left his office, Bornstein pointed out what appeared to be a small, naked doll sitting on the ground ÃÂ ÃÂhereÃÂs a naked doorstop.ÃÂ

Bornstein says he isn't sure whether he'll continue as Trump's physician while Trump serves as president. As a media professional, I think I speak for all of us when I say we'd prefer that he did."	0
114	"The Republican PartyÃÂs attempt to treat Donald Trump as a normal political candidate would be laughable were it not so perilous to the republic. If only he would mouth the partyÃÂs ÃÂconservativeÃÂ principles, all would be well.

But of course the entire Trump phenomenon has nothing to do with policy or ideology. It has nothing to do with the Republican Party, either, except in its historic role as incubator of this singular threat to our democracy. Trump has transcended the party that produced him. His growing army of supporters no longer cares about the party. Because it did not immediately and fully embrace Trump, because a dwindling number of its political and intellectual leaders still resist him, the party is regarded with suspicion and even hostility by his followers. Their allegiance is to him and him alone.

And the source of allegiance? WeÃÂre supposed to believe that TrumpÃÂs support stems from economic stagnation or dislocation. Maybe some of it does. But what Trump offers his followers are not economic remedies ÃÂ his proposals change daily. What he offers is an attitude, an aura of crude strength and machismo, a boasting disrespect for the niceties of the democratic culture that he claims, and his followers believe, has produced national weakness and incompetence. His incoherent and contradictory utterances have one thing in common: They provoke and play on feelings of resentment and disdain, intermingled with bits of fear, hatred and anger. His public discourse consists of attacking or ridiculing a wide range of ÃÂothersÃÂ ÃÂ Muslims, Hispanics, women, Chinese, Mexicans, Europeans, Arabs, immigrants, refugees ÃÂ whom he depicts either as threats or as objects of derision. His program, such as it is, consists chiefly of promises to get tough with foreigners and people of nonwhite complexion. He will deport them, bar them, get them to knuckle under, make them pay up or make them shut up.

That this tough-guy, get-mad-and-get-even approach has gained him an increasingly large and enthusiastic following has probably surprised Trump as much as anyone else. Trump himself is simply and quite literally an egomaniac. But the phenomenon he has created and now leads has become something larger than him, and something far more dangerous.

Republican politicians marvel at how he has ÃÂtapped intoÃÂ a hitherto unknown swath of the voting public. But what he has tapped into is what the founders most feared when they established the democratic republic: the popular passions unleashed, the ÃÂmobocracy.ÃÂ Conservatives have been warning for decades about government suffocating liberty. But here is the other threat to liberty that Alexis de Tocqueville and the ancient philosophers warned about: that the people in a democracy, excited, angry and unconstrained, might run roughshod over even the institutions created to preserve their freedoms. As Alexander Hamilton watched the French Revolution unfold, he feared in America what he saw play out in France ÃÂ that the unleashing of popular passions would lead not to greater democracy but to the arrival of a tyrant, riding to power on the shoulders of the people.

This phenomenon has arisen in other democratic and quasi-democratic countries over the past century, and it has generally been called ÃÂfascism.ÃÂ Fascist movements, too, had no coherent ideology, no clear set of prescriptions for what ailed society. ÃÂNational socialismÃÂ was a bundle of contradictions, united chiefly by what, and who, it opposed; fascism in Italy was anti-liberal, anti-democratic, anti-Marxist, anti-capitalist and anti-clerical. Successful fascism was not about policies but about the strongman, the leader (Il Duce, Der FÃÂ¼hrer), in whom could be entrusted the fate of the nation. Whatever the problem, he could fix it. Whatever the threat, internal or external, he could vanquish it, and it was unnecessary for him to explain how. Today, there is Putinism, which also has nothing to do with belief or policy but is about the tough man who single-handedly defends his people against all threats, foreign and domestic.

To understand how such movements take over a democracy, one only has to watch the Republican Party today. These movements play on all the fears, vanities, ambitions and insecurities that make up the human psyche. In democracies, at least for politicians, the only thing that matters is what the voters say they want ÃÂ vox populi vox Dei. A mass political movement is thus a powerful and, to those who would oppose it, frightening weapon. When controlled and directed by a single leader, it can be aimed at whomever the leader chooses. If someone criticizes or opposes the leader, it doesnÃÂt matter how popular or admired that person has been. He might be a famous war hero, but if the leader derides and ridicules his heroism, the followers laugh and jeer. He might be the highest-ranking elected guardian of the partyÃÂs most cherished principles. But if he hesitates to support the leader, he faces political death.

In such an environment, every political figure confronts a stark choice: Get right with the leader and his mass following or get run over. The human race in such circumstances breaks down into predictable categories ÃÂ and democratic politicians are the most predictable. There are those whose ambition leads them to jump on the bandwagon. They praise the leaderÃÂs incoherent speeches as the beginning of wisdom, hoping he will reward them with a plum post in the new order. There are those who merely hope to survive. Their consciences wonÃÂt let them curry favor so shamelessly, so they mumble their pledges of support, like the victims in StalinÃÂs show trials, perhaps not realizing that the leader and his followers will get them in the end anyway.

RNC chairman: Republicans will find common ground with Trump  Play Video0:56
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and the GOP will find common ground ahead of the general election. (Reuters)
A great number will simply kid themselves, refusing to admit that something very different from the usual politics is afoot. Let the storm pass, they insist, and then we can pick up the pieces, rebuild and get back to normal. Meanwhile, donÃÂt alienate the leaderÃÂs mass following. After all, they are voters and will need to be brought back into the fold. As for Trump himself, letÃÂs shape him, advise him, steer him in the right direction and, not incidentally, save our political skins.

What these people do not or will not see is that, once in power, Trump will owe them and their party nothing. He will have ridden to power despite the party, catapulted into the White House by a mass following devoted only to him. By then that following will have grown dramatically. Today, less than 5 percent of eligible voters have voted for Trump. But if he wins the election, his legions will likely comprise a majority of the nation. Imagine the power he would wield then. In addition to all that comes from being the leader of a mass following, he would also have the immense powers of the American presidency at his command: the Justice Department, the FBI, the intelligence services, the military. Who would dare to oppose him then? Certainly not a Republican Party that lay down before him even when he was comparatively weak. And is a man like Trump, with infinitely greater power in his hands, likely to become more humble, more judicious, more generous, less vengeful than he is today, than he has been his whole life? Does vast power un-corrupt?

This is how fascism comes to America, not with jackboots and salutes (although there have been salutes, and a whiff of violence) but with a television huckster, a phony billionaire, a textbook egomaniac ÃÂtapping intoÃÂ popular resentments and insecurities, and with an entire national political party ÃÂ out of ambition or blind party loyalty, or simply out of fear ÃÂ falling into line behind him."	0
115	"Before running against billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump for the presidency, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told an audience at a private, paid speech she wanted to see more successful businessmen and women run for office because they canÃÂt be bought.

In a speech made public by Wikileaks ÃÂ which released an email from Hillary for America Research Director Tony Caark containing three attached speeches given at a private Goldman Sachs events ÃÂ Clinton spoke and took audience questions at the ÃÂBuilders and Innovators SummitÃÂ hosted by Goldman Sachs on October 29, 2013.

Answering a question about businessmen in politics, Clinton said that they are ÃÂmost often the people that look over the horizon,ÃÂ and therefore share a vision that many politicians of today lack. ÃÂAnd thatÃÂs a very good question and thank you for asking it. Yes, I would love to see more businessmen go into politics because I believe they would bring in an entirely different mindset and strategies than what weÃÂre used to seeing traditionally,ÃÂ she opined.

And then she just had to go on. ÃÂIn fact, when you say businessmen and women, I canÃÂt help but think of a particular one that I would just love to see running for the presidency at some point in the future,ÃÂ Clinton added. ÃÂI donÃÂt know what it is exactly about him, I canÃÂt quite put my finger on it, but my instinct is almost never wrong. And itÃÂs telling me that Donald Trump would be very successful if he were to venture into politics in the future.ÃÂ

Asked to elaborate on her statement, the former Secretary of State argued that she thinks that businessmen ÃÂcanÃÂt be boughtÃÂ and that theyÃÂre ÃÂvery honest.ÃÂ ÃÂAnd I think that goes especially for Donald Trump, whose successful projects and business ventures have made him synonymous with big business and, more importantly, creating thousands of jobs. I also think he understands the philanthropic and charitable side of things quite well, which is a crucial skill for any politician,ÃÂ she praised her current counter-candidate.

ÃÂI think he has a lot to offer to this country and its people, especially when weÃÂre talking about the economy,ÃÂ she continued. ÃÂDonald Trump has single-handedly helped stop the recession, more so than dozens of other so-called billionaires. And I donÃÂt know how the experts on the matter feel, but in my book thatÃÂs hard evidence of the manÃÂs business prowess and integrity, as well. And I think everyone would agree those are commendable character traits for anyone looking to tackle the most difficult problems and challenges in the world, quite literally.ÃÂ

ÃÂSo, yes ÃÂ Donald Trump is someone I could very easily see winning the support of the people. And I donÃÂt think he would do that with his flammable rhetoric and negotiation skills ÃÂ which are both things heÃÂs known for ÃÂ but with common sense and respect for his fellow countrymen. But, most of all ÃÂ I think his relationship with the opposite sex would bring him the most political points. I think he respects women and treats them as equals and I also think that would bring him a significant lead over anyone unlucky enough to be running against him,ÃÂ she ominously concluded in her 2013 speech."	1
116	"RICHMOND ÃÂ The FBI and local police are investigating how at least 19 dead Virginians were recently re-registered to vote in this critical swing state.

One case came to light after relatives of a deceased man received a note congratulating him for registering, Rockingham County CommonwealthÃÂs Attorney Marsha Garst said Thursday.

ÃÂHis family members were very distraught,ÃÂ said Garst, who confirmed the existence of the FBI and police investigation but said she could provide few details because the case is ongoing.

All 19 were initially registered as voters in the Shenandoah Valley city of Harrisonburg, although a clerk double-checking the entries later raised questions about one. She recognized the name of Richard Allen Claybrook Sr., who died in 2014 at age 87, because his son is a well-known local judge. She happened to recall that the judgeÃÂs father had died.

ÃÂHe was a retired Fairfax County elementary school principal and had fought in World War II,ÃÂ said his son, retired Harrisonburg General District Court Judge Richard Allen Claybrook Jr. ÃÂSo our family is very disgusted that they would pick his name, because he was such a law-abiding citizen devoted to public service.ÃÂ

All of the forms had been submitted by a private group that was working to register voters on the campus of James Madison University, according to the Harrisonburg registrarÃÂs office. The group was not identified. No charges have been filed.

Republicans in the state House of Delegates, who in recent years have supported tighter voter ID laws, held a conference call with reporters to call attention to the investigation.

ÃÂOftentimes we hear our Democratic colleagues suggest that voter fraud doesnÃÂt exist in Virginia, or itÃÂs a myth,ÃÂ House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) said. ÃÂThis is proof that voter fraud not only exists but is ongoing and is a threat to the integrity of our elections.ÃÂ

House Minority Leader David J. Toscano (D-Charlottesville) said the case was not proof of voter fraud because no one had actually managed to cast a vote in the names of the dead.

ÃÂFirst of all, there was no voter fraud ÃÂ they caught him,ÃÂ Toscano said. ÃÂNobody cast a vote. .?.?. ThereÃÂs still no evidence of that going on in the state. But there is evidence every time you turn around that the Republicans are trying to make it more difficult for citizens to vote in elections.ÃÂ"	0

118	"All politicians bend the truth to fit their purposes, including Hillary Clinton. But Donald J. Trump has unleashed a blizzard of falsehoods, exaggerations and outright lies in the general election, peppering his speeches, interviews and Twitter posts with untruths so frequent that they can seem flighty or random ÃÂ even compulsive.

However, a closer examination, over the course of a week, revealed an unmistakable pattern: Virtually all of Mr. TrumpÃÂs falsehoods directly bolstered a powerful and self-aggrandizing narrative depicting him as a heroic savior for a nation menaced from every direction. Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist, described the practice as creating ÃÂan unreality bubble that he surrounds himself with.ÃÂ

The New York Times closely tracked Mr. TrumpÃÂs public statements from Sept. 15-21, and assembled a list of his 31 biggest whoppers, many of them uttered repeatedly. This total excludes dozens more: Untruths that appeared to be mere hyperbole or humor, or delivered purely for effect, or what could generously be called rounding errors. Mr. TrumpÃÂs campaign, which dismissed this compilation as ÃÂsilly,ÃÂ offered responses on every point, but in none of the following instances did the responses support his assertions.

Tall Tales About Himself

Mr. TrumpÃÂs version of reality allows for few, if any, flaws in himself. As he tells it, the polls are always looking up, his policy solutions are painless and simple and his judgment regarding politics and people has been consistent ÃÂ and flawless. The most consistent falsehood he tells about himself may be that he opposed the war in Iraq from the start, when the evidence shows otherwise.

1He said a supportive crowd chanted, ÃÂLet him speak!ÃÂ when a black pastor in Flint, Mich., asked Mr. Trump not to give a political speech in the church.
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 15.
There were no such chants.
2ÃÂI was against going into the war in Iraq.ÃÂ
SPEECH IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 19.
This is not getting any truer with repetition. He never publicly expressed opposition to the war before it began, and he made supportive remarks to Howard Stern.
3He said any supportive comments he made about the Iraq war came ÃÂlong beforeÃÂ the war began.
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 18.
He expressed support for the war in September 2002, when Congress was debating whether to authorize military action.
4He said he had publicly opposed the Iraq war in an Esquire interview ÃÂpretty quickly after the war started.ÃÂ
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 18.
The Esquire interview appeared in the August 2004 edition, 17 months after the war began.
5Before the Iraq invasion, he said, he had told the Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto something ÃÂpretty closeÃÂ to: ÃÂDonÃÂt go in, and donÃÂt make the mistake of going in.ÃÂ
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 18.
Not remotely close. He told Mr. Cavuto that President George W. Bush had to take decisive action.
6He said that when Howard Stern asked him about Iraq in 2002, it was ÃÂthe first time the word Iraq was ever mentioned to me.ÃÂ

Polls show him winning virtually no support from African-Americans.
8ÃÂAlmost, it seems, everybody agreesÃÂ with his position on immigration.
REMARKS IN TEXAS, SEPT. 17.
Most Americans oppose his signature positions on immigration.
9He has made ÃÂa lot of progressÃÂ with Hispanic and black voters, and ÃÂyou see that in the polls.ÃÂ
FRED DICKER RADIO SHOW, SEPT. 15.
No major poll has shown him making up significant ground with black or Hispanic voters.
10He was ÃÂnever a fanÃÂ of Colin Powell.

In his book ÃÂThe America We Deserve,ÃÂ he named Mr. Powell as among the ÃÂbest and brightestÃÂ in American society.
11Mr. Trump said that after The Times published an article scrutinizing his relationships with women, ÃÂAll the women came out and said they think Donald Trump is terrific.ÃÂ
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 18.
Only one woman who was quoted in the article came to his defense after its publication.

Unfounded Claims About
Critics and the News Media

ItÃÂs not just Mrs. Clinton whom Mr. Trump belittles and tars with inaccurate information. He also distorted the facts about his Republican critics, including President George Bush and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. And he claimed that Lester Holt, the NBC anchor moderating the first presidential debate, is a Democrat ÃÂ but Mr. Holt is a registered Republican.

13In the primaries, Mr. Kasich ÃÂwon one and, by the way, didnÃÂt win it by much ÃÂ that was Ohio.ÃÂ
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 19.
Mr. Kasich crushed him in Ohio, winning by 11 percentage points.
14Lester Holt, the NBC anchor and debate moderator, ÃÂis a Democrat.ÃÂ

Mr. Holt is a registered Republican, New York City records show.
15The presidential debate moderators ÃÂare all Democrats.ÃÂ ÃÂItÃÂs a very unfair system.ÃÂ
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 19.
Only one, Chris Wallace of Fox News, is a registered Democrat.
16He said it ÃÂhasnÃÂt been reportedÃÂ that Mrs. Clinton called some Trump supporters ÃÂdeplorable.ÃÂ
SPEECH IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20.
It would be difficult to find a news organization that didnÃÂt report her remark.
Inaccurate Claims About Clinton

Mr. Trump regularly dissembles about his opponent, attributing ideas to Mrs. Clinton that she has not endorsed, or accusing her of complicity in events in which she had no involvement.

17ÃÂHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it.ÃÂ
REMARKS IN WASHINGTON, SEPT. 16.
Mrs. Clinton and her campaign never publicly questioned President ObamaÃÂs birthplace; Mr. Trump made it his signature cause for five years.
18Mrs. Clinton had ÃÂthe power and the dutyÃÂ to stop the release of unauthorized immigrants whose home countries would not accept their deportation after they were released from prison.
NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN COLORADO, SEPT. 17, AND FLORIDA, SEPT. 19.
The secretary of state does not have the power to detain convicted criminals after they have served their sentences, and has little power to make foreign countries accept deportees.
19Mrs. Clinton has not criticized jihadists and foreign governments that oppress and kill women, gay people and non-Muslims. ÃÂHas Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable? No.ÃÂ
SPEECH IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 19.
She has denounced jihadists and foreign countries on the same grounds, if not necessarily using the same words.
20ÃÂDo people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies ÃÂ she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning.ÃÂ
TWITTER, SEPT. 20.
He did not invent the tarmac rally or the campaign-plane backdrop.
21Mrs. Clinton destroyed 13 smartphones with a hammer while she was secretary of state.
SPEECHES IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 15 AND SEPT. 19.
An aide told the F.B.I. of only two occasions in which phones were destroyed with a hammer.
22He said Mrs. Clinton is calling for ÃÂtotal amnesty in the first 100 days,ÃÂ including ÃÂa virtual end to immigration enforcementÃÂ and for unauthorized immigrants to receive Social Security and Medicare.
SPEECH IN COLORADO, SEPT. 17.
She has not proposed this.
23Mrs. Clinton is ÃÂeffectively proposing to abolish the borders around the country.ÃÂ
NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN TEXAS, SEPT. 17.
She is not even proposing to cut funding for the Border Patrol.
24ÃÂHillary ClintonÃÂs plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term alone,ÃÂ and would cost $400 billion.
NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20.
She endorsed admitting 65,000 Syrian refugees this year, on top of other admissions. Mr. Trump is falsely claiming that she wants to do this every year and is estimating the cost accordingly.
Stump Speech Falsehoods

Some warped or inaccurate claims have become regular features of Mr. TrumpÃÂs stump speech. He routinely overstates the scale and nature of the countryÃÂs economic distress and the threats to its national security, and exaggerates the potential for overnight improvements if he were elected.

25ÃÂOur African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that theyÃÂve ever been in before ÃÂ ever, ever, ever.ÃÂ
SPEECH IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20.
No measurement supports this characterization of black America.
26Fifty-eight percent of black youth are not working.
NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 16, AND COLORADO, SEPT. 17.
This misleading statistic counts high school students as out of work. Black youth unemployment actually was 20.6 percent in July.
27Many dangerous refugees are being welcomed by the Obama administration. ÃÂHundreds of thousands of people are being approved to pour into the country. We have no idea who they are.ÃÂ
NEW HAMPSHIRE SPEECH, SEPT. 15.
The Obama administration has admitted more than 10,000 Syrian refugees, using an extensive screening process.
28ÃÂWe have cities that are far more dangerous than Afghanistan.ÃÂ
NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 16; COLORADO, SEPT. 17; NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20; OHIO, SEPT. 21; AND A FOX NEWS INTERVIEW ON SEPT. 21.
No American city resembles a war zone, though crime has risen lately in some, like Chicago. Urban violence has fallen precipitously over the past 25 years.
29Ford plans to cut American jobs by relocating small-car production to Mexico, and may move all production outside the United States.
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW AND NEW HAMPSHIRE SPEECH, SEPT. 15.
Mark Fields, FordÃÂs chief executive, said it was not cutting American jobs.
30ÃÂWe have a trade deficit this year with China of approximately $500 billion.ÃÂ
NORTH CAROLINA SPEECH, SEPT. 20.
He has made this claim repeatedly, but the trade deficit with China is significantly smaller.
Esoteric Embellishments

Mr. Trump often dissembles on subjects of passing interest, like the news of the day or the parochial concerns of his local audiences. But his larger pattern of behavior still holds: These misstatements, too, accentuate the grievances of his supporters, and cast his own ideas in a more favorable light.

31Senator Bernie Sanders fell victim to ÃÂa rigged system with the superdelegates.ÃÂ

119	"WASHINGTON ÃÂ Republicans are united on repealing President Barack ObamaÃÂs health care law, but ideologically and practically speaking, theyÃÂre in different camps over replacing it. Getting the factions together wonÃÂt be easy.

Some Republicans would revise and rebrand Obamacare,  junking unpopular provisions like its requirement that most Americans carry health insurance, while preserving well-liked parts. Others would rip up the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and not replace it.

 Can Congress put aside differences in the new year?

Can Congress put aside differences in the new year?
President-elect Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders will have to unite the groups on complicated changes affecting the financial and physical well-being of millions of people. For some constituents in fragile health, itÃÂs literally a life-and-death debate.

Republicans have ÃÂa really narrow path,ÃÂ says Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute, a free-market health care research organization. ÃÂTheyÃÂve got to deal with the politics of this, theyÃÂve got to make sure they come up with good policy, and they also have process challenges.ÃÂ

Success is not guaranteed, and Republicans may come to regret that their party defined itself as totally opposed to Obamacare.

Yet House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady seems unfazed by the challenge. ÃÂItÃÂs like tax reform,ÃÂ says Brady, a Texas Republican, explaining that many pieces will be pulled together. ÃÂUnlike Obamacare, which ripped up the individual market, this will be done deliberately, in an appropriate timetable.ÃÂ

Republicans say they will move quickly to repeal the ACA, while suspending the effective date to allow them to craft a replacement. HereÃÂs a look at the GOP camps and whoÃÂs in them:

Revise and rebrand

Many Republicans may quietly be in this contingent, but fear being accused of promoting Obamacare-lite.

TheyÃÂd strip out some of the ACAÃÂs taxes and requirements. The unpopular individual mandate to carry health insurance or risk fines could be replaced with other persuasion short of a government dictate. Rules on insurers would be loosened.

But popular provisions such as protecting those with pre-existing health conditions would be retained in some form, as well as financial assistance for low- and moderate-income people. The requirement that health plans cover adult children until age 26 would be fairly easy to preserve, since employers have accommodated it.

A rebranded version of ObamaÃÂs law may well cover fewer people. But its GOP advocates believe most Americans will find their goal of universal access to care politically acceptable when measured against the Democratic ideal of universal coverage, underwritten by government.

Many GOP allies in the business community favor revising the ACA. That includes major players among hospitals, insurers and pharmaceuticals.

Trump may have given this group some cover by saying that he wants to keep parts of the law, but his bottom line remains unknown.

Budget hawks

 For budget hawks, unwinding the Obama health law is a beginning. Next they could move on to much bigger objectives like restructuring Medicaid and Medicare, and placing a cost-conscious limit on tax breaks for employer coverage.

Budget hawks see health care as the main driver of government deficits, and they are loath to address that imbalance by raising taxes. Instead they want to rewrite the social compact so individuals accept more responsibility and risk for their health care.

House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is the most prominent member of this camp, and his ÃÂBetter WayÃÂ agenda is its roadmap. Georgia Rep. Tom Price, TrumpÃÂs nominee for Health and Human Services, is a budget hawk. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has been in the same orbit throughout his career.

The problem for budget hawks is that the 2016 political campaign did not give them a mandate. Issues like Medicare and Medicaid were scarcely discussed. Trump said he wouldnÃÂt cut Medicare, and sent conflicting signals on Medicaid.

Many Democrats canÃÂt wait for Republicans to follow the call of the budget hawks. Betting that will backfire, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is rallying her lawmakers against ÃÂattacks on the ACA and Medicare.ÃÂ

The rip-it-up society

 The most conservative lawmakers want to ÃÂpull Obamacare up by the roots as if it never existed,ÃÂ says Republican political consultant Frank Luntz. That sentiment is embodied by the 40 or so members of the House Freedom Caucus, and itÃÂs probably broadly shared among conservatives.

Some do not believe the federal government should be involved in health care, and they couldnÃÂt care less about replacing the ACA.

ÃÂThey would say that ObamaÃÂs plan has failed,ÃÂ said Luntz.

GOP leaders may need these lawmakers to advance on replacement legislation; coaxing them to a middle ground might not be possible.

Trump calls the ACA ÃÂa disaster,ÃÂ and thatÃÂs pleasing to those farthest on the right. ItÃÂs unclear if heÃÂd walk their walk.

Pragmatists 

At the core of this small group are legislative veterans who understand the excruciating difficulties of getting major bills to a presidentÃÂs desk. GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine are pragmatists.

They may find support from Republican governors who expanded Medicaid under the health law. GOP congressional leaders could gravitate to this camp.

The biggest challenge for pragmatists will be to win over some Democrats for replacement legislation. While repealing most of ÃÂObamacareÃÂ is possible with a simple majority in the Senate, 60 votes would probably be needed for a replacement. There will only be 52 GOP senators next year.

ÃÂRepublicans need a fancy Rose Garden repeal ceremony...and I expect them to have one,ÃÂ said Dan Mendelson, CEO of the consulting firm Avalere Health. ÃÂOn the other hand, thereÃÂs 20 million people with health insurance under the ACA, and they donÃÂt want to dump them. ThereÃÂs no clear path for how to square that conflict.ÃÂ"	0
120	"DONALD J. Trump has told Fox and Friends that he believes the U.S. ÃÂshould never have allowedÃÂ Canada to gain independence. The republican candidate for president freely admits to being ÃÂa little rustyÃÂ on Canadian history, but feels confident that the United States owned Canada ÃÂat some pointÃÂ, and claims giving it back was a ÃÂmajor mistakeÃÂ.

The former reality tv star was responding to a question about Puerto Rico possibly becoming the 51st of the United States, when he made the statement. ÃÂIt used to be 51 you know, when we had Canada,ÃÂ Trump said, pointing to an American flag, ÃÂOr 52 if you count Mexico which I never will, no matter how much they beg.ÃÂ

The interviewer Brian Kilmeade, seemed unmoved by TrumpÃÂs remark and asked him to explain his understanding of Canadian/American history, as the Fox host began scribbling notes:

ÃÂI personally think it was the biggest mistake in American history, giving Canada back. Look at that place now, itÃÂs falling to pieces. ItÃÂs overrun by godless, gunless hippies and itÃÂs such a shame to see.ÃÂ

As the host nodded along, Trump explained that America got a ÃÂterrible dealÃÂ with Canada who ÃÂstoleÃÂ the land over a thousand years ago ÃÂor something like thatÃÂ.

ÃÂIt was a truly awful deal. Canada gets Toronto and Vancouver, which has the hottest women, and what did we get? Alaska? The Florida of Canada? Such a terrible deal.ÃÂ

122	"Walmart removed several varieties of shirts and hoodies with the slogan ÃÂBulletproof: Black Lives MatterÃÂ from its website, a spokesperson confirmed Wednesday, after a police union complained they were offensive.

Canterbury wrote that the clothing would ÃÂdamage your companyÃÂs good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.ÃÂ The FOP calls itself the worldÃÂs largest law enforcement group, claiming more than 330,000 members in 2,200 lodges.

123	"Following WednesdayÃÂs presidential debate Pentagon officials found themselves completely dumbfounded as to why former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would feel it appropriate to announce U.S. Special Access Program intel on national television.

According to sources within the Department of Defense speaking under anonymity, Clinton likely violated at least two Dept. of Defense SAP protocols during the debate by announcing on live television the United States GovernmentÃÂs response time for a nuclear launch.To the dismay of intelligence officials, the fact that this top secret information is now publicly known not only proves that Clinton is ÃÂunfit to be commander-in-chief,ÃÂ but it also poses a direct threat to national security.

One high ranking intelligence official explained that any time frame calculated pertaining to a US nuclear launch ÃÂwould have merely been an educated hypothesis, absent leaked documents and there have been no such breachesÃÂ prior to ClintonÃÂs admission Wednesday.

Via TruePundit

ÃÂSecretary Clinton proved tonight she is unfit to be commander-in-chief,ÃÂ a top-ranking DOD intelligence source said. ÃÂWhat she did compromises our national security. She is cavalier and reckless and in my opinion should be detained and questioned so we can unravel why she did what she did.ÃÂ

According to Pentagon sources, the information Clinton disseminated publicly is Top Secret intelligence governed under the U.S. Special Access Program (SAP) which dictates safeguards and protocols for accessing and discussing highly classified and Top Secret intelligence. The specific details of the countryÃÂs nuclear response time discussed by Clinton, sources said, are only known by a handful of individuals outside top military brassÃÂ

ÃÂTargeting options by ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missiles), air or sea, launch order, launch procedures and response are some of the most secretly guarded tenets of national security and nuclear war policy,ÃÂ a Pentagon source said. ÃÂItÃÂs truly incredible that (nuclear) response time as part of an ERO (Emergency Response Option) is now out there in the public domain to our adversaries.ÃÂ

U.S. Defense sources said according to developed U.S. counterintelligence, military officials in China, North Korea, Syria, Russia, Iran and even actors like ISIS had no previous definitive intelligence to determine the U.S. nuclear response time, especially during an ERO, prior to ClintonÃÂs admission Wednesday night.

127	"Hillary Clinton has reached the 2,383 delegates today. This is what she needed to win the party nomination for the 2016 Presidential race. She is officially the first woman nominee of a major U.S. political party. The Associated Press released a new count of her pledged delegates and showed that she has reached the magic number.

*** This is an outright lie.

Besides being suspiciously announced right before the California primary tomorrow. A spokesman for Bernie Sanders, Michael Briggs said Monday that the number that was released today depends on superdelegates. This means that this is not an official victory.

ÃÂIt is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgement, are ignoring the Democratic National CommitteeÃÂs clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer,ÃÂ he said.

*** What else would you expect from CROOKED Hillary?



Briggs says that Sanders could potentially change the minds of those superdelegates before the Democratic Convention.

ÃÂSecretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂShe will be dependent on superdelegates who do not vote until July 25 and who can change their minds between now and then. They include more than 400 superdelegates who endorsed Secretary Clinton 10 months before the first caucuses and primaries and long before any other candidate was in the race.

ÃÂOur job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump.ÃÂ

In another recent tweet, Clinton said that ÃÂwe are on the brink of a historic moment, but we still have work to do.ÃÂ

128	"President Obama has indefinitely blocked offshore drilling in areas of the Atlantic Ocean and in Arctic waters, a move aimed at advancing environmental protection during his final days in office.

The Arctic protections are a joint partnership with Canada. ""These actions, and Canada's parallel actions, protect a sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on earth,"" the White House said in a statement.

""They reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region's harsh conditions is limited,"" the White House added. ""By contrast, it would take decades to fully develop the production infrastructure necessary for any large-scale oil and gas leasing production in the region ÃÂ at a time when we need to continue to move decisively away from fossil fuels.""


This map shows the Atlantic areas that have been designated off limits to oil and gas explorations and development activity.
White House
Obama's action designates 31 Atlantic canyons ""off limits to oil and gas exploration and development activity,"" totaling 3.8 million acres, according to the administration. It provides the same protections to much of the Arctic's waters, covering the ""vast majority of U.S. waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas,"" totaling 115 million acres. Canada is doing the same to ""all Arctic Canadian waters,"" the joint statement adds.

Obama took these actions by invoking a law called the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which gives the president the authority to withdraw lands from oil and gas leases. But as NPR's Jeff Brady and Jennifer Ludden report, major questions remain about what will happen if the incoming Trump administration attempts to reverse this action.

""The White House says the president is acting within his authority, that Presidents of both parties have done this in the past, and trying to reverse such an order would be unprecedented if Trump tried to do this,"" Jeff said on All Things Considered.

There is no legal precedent for reversal, Jeff reports. ""So if there's a legal challenge, and I'm not going to be surprised if there is one, it's really not clear what a court would decide.""


This map shows the area that the U.S. has designated as indefinitely off limits to offshore oil and gas leasing.
White House
As Bloomberg reports, the ""statute doesn't include a provision for reversal and that action may take years to work its way through court.""

Environmental groups such as Oceana are celebrating the designation. ""President Obama has taken a key step in protecting important areas of the Atlantic Ocean from offshore drilling,"" as Jacqueline Savitz, the group's senior vice president for the United States, said in a statement. ""The people of the Atlantic coast refused to allow their way of life to be compromised and we commend their hard work making their voices heard in Washington.""

Representatives of the oil and gas industry are unhappy about the news. ""We think it's a very short-sighted decision to take these areas off limits,"" Andy Radford, senior policy advisor for offshore issues at the American Petroleum Institute, told Jeff the action poses ""great risk to our energy security going forward and eliminates the opportunity to create jobs and help small businesses throughout the country. ""

Earlier this year, the Obama administration reversed course on a plan that would have allowed Atlantic offshore drilling after uproar from local communities and environmentalists.

Then, the administration designated the first national marine monument in the Atlantic Ocean. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that it has protected an Atlantic area about the size of New Jersey from deep-sea commercial fishing."	0

132	"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) ÃÂ Following the results of Tuesday nightÃÂs election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805, which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19th. Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day, too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted, equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically.

ÃÂPeople all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,ÃÂ Obama told reporters. ÃÂMany have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.ÃÂ

Under the PresidentÃÂs order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in TuesdayÃÂs election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college.

Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the presidentÃÂs decision.

ÃÂCrooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didnÃÂt allow that to happen. President Obama doesnÃÂt care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.ÃÂ

The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college.

ÃÂWe have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.ÃÂ

Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election.

ÃÂMost people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes, but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19th. What the people are actually voting for are their statesÃÂ electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.ÃÂ

Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the PresidentÃÂs Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether.

ÃÂ[The electoral college] is a fÃÂking joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise. Everyone should have an equal vote, and thatÃÂs just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. ItÃÂs time to bring our system into the 21st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.ÃÂ

Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward.

ÃÂWeÃÂre going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,ÃÂ Obama said. ÃÂWhy did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasnÃÂt this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?ÃÂ Obama said. ÃÂIf all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.ÃÂ

If you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19th election, you can call the Obama administrationÃÂs special election hotline at (785) 273-0325."	1
133	"On a recent trip to Texas, Hillary Clinton showed she is directly in the pocket of Pakistani Muslims! 

Sources close to the private fundraiser held for Hillary Clinton in Beaumont, TX told 12News it raised hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Some estimates put the amount collected at half-a-million dollars, making it one of the top five private fundraisers Clinton has had in this country.

Pakistani businessman Tahir Javed hosted the reception for Clinton at this home in West Beaumont.

Former U.S. Representative Nick Lampson, who attended the event, says 250 people were there.

Lampson says Clinton spoke about education, healthcare and individual freedoms for people of all backgrounds and faiths.

Many of the Pakistanis at the event were pleased with Clinton's vocal support of the Muslim religion.

Aisha Zahid said, ""Talking about Muslims and favoring Muslims, so I really appreciate her whatever effort she is making against Islamaphobia, so I really think she needs to be the next President of the United States.""

Also in attendance, congress people from the Houston area, Sheila Jackson-Lee and Al Green.

But not everyone was a fan.  A handful of protesters demonstrated near the event, over Clinton's response to the Benghazi attack and her email controversy.

With all the terrorism perpetrated against the United States and our people - from 9/11 right up to the 14 people machine-gunned to death in San Bernardino, CA, -- why would Hillary do this?  Because Hillary Clinton is in the pocket of Muslims.

135	"The Federal Reserve is virtually certain to raise interest rates this week for the first time this year, but the course of future hikes has suddenly become cloudier.

The Fed has signaled for many weeks that it plans to hoist its key rate by a quarter percentage point at a two-day meeting that begins Tuesday, and futures markets say thereÃÂs a 93% chance it will follow through.

Meanwhile, President-elect Donald TrumpÃÂs fiscal stimulus proposals may ultimately require faster rate increases to head off inflation, while other byproducts of his plan could slow the economy and prompt the Fed to act more cautiously.

For now, economists donÃÂt expect Fed policymakers to weigh such hypotheticals as they draft their quarterly projections for rate increases over the next few years. Even so, with unemployment falling rapidly and inflation finally picking up, Fed officials likely are no longer inclined to call for slower rate hikes over the long-term, as they have in each of their previous forecasts this year amid headwinds such as weak productivity growth, economists say.


ÃÂUnemployment is falling toward levels that are arguably below stable inflation,ÃÂ says Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economics professor and author of the Fedwatch blog.  Yet he says the Fed will almost certainly reiterate that rate increases will be gradual.

In November, the jobless rate dropped to 4.6% from 4.9% the previous month. ThatÃÂs already below the 4.8% that the Fed has deemed the lowest average rate sustainable without generating excessive inflation, or rapid price increases that decrease consumers' purchasing power and especially hurt savers and those on fixed incomes. Low unemployment typically pushes up wages as employers compete for fewer available workers, and price increases typically follow as the firms scramble to maintain profit margins.

That doesnÃÂt mean persistently low inflation is poised to suddenly spike.While an inflation measure closely monitored by the Fed rose from 1.2% to 1.4% annually in October as the effects of low gasoline prices faded, thatÃÂs well below the FedÃÂs 2% target.

Still, it was the fastest pace in two years. And annual wage growth hit a seven-year high in October and has climbed steadily since early 2015 in ÃÂa further signal that inflation is firming,ÃÂ Barclays economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients.

In September, Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted that discouraged workers on the sidelines were streaming back into the labor force, keeping the unemployment rate elevated and providing the economy ÃÂmore room to runÃÂ without stoking inflation. But the labor force shrank in both October and November, giving the Fed another reason to make a move this week and stick with its previous forecast of two rate hikes next year and three in 2018.

ÃÂIf you were to wait any longer, you would risk getting behind the curve,ÃÂ says JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli. The Fed held off on rate increases earlier this year in response to ChinaÃÂs slowdown and a sluggish U.S. economy, among other factors.

The future roadmap is fuzzier. Trump has proposed a $1 trillion plan to upgrade the nationÃÂs infrastructure and sharp tax cuts, a stimulus package that, if passed by Congress, could fuel inflation and force the Fed to lift rates more rapidly.

But, ÃÂItÃÂs probably too early for the Fed to incorporate any fiscal policy issues into their forecast,ÃÂ Duy says. ItÃÂs similarly too soon, he says, to anticipate  negative economic fallout from TrumpÃÂs restrictive trade proposals.

On the other hand, the prospect of more federal spending and faster economic growth and inflation under Trump already has strengthened the dollar and pushed up long-term interest rates. Those developments tend to crimp the economy by hurting U.S. exports and discouraging consumer and business borrowing.

If they were to persist or intensify next year, the Fed may raise rates more gradually than anticipated, especially if the faster growth portended by TrumpÃÂs plan hasnÃÂt yet materialized, Feroli says."	0
136	"Hillary Clinton intends to keep her campaign organization together for the next four years and run again for president in 2020.

ÃÂSheÃÂs convinced that, sooner than later, the voters will come to their senses and realize they made a horrible mistake by putting [Donald] Trump in the White House,ÃÂ a source close to Hillary told Ed Klein Confidential. ÃÂSheÃÂs sure the voters will beg her to get in the race and she says, ÃÂIÃÂm going to run again in 2020.ÃÂÃÂ

Not all her advisers agree. In fact, several of them believe Hillary is in a bad wayÃÂdeeply depressed, drinking too much, and delusional about her chances of making a successful run for the White House four years from now when sheÃÂll be 73 and in shaky health.

But these advisers are afraid to dash HillaryÃÂs presidential dreams and send her into an even deeper depression.

ÃÂHillary is in a state of denial and accepts zero responsibility for her loss to Trump,ÃÂ one of these sources said. ÃÂSheÃÂs convinced that [FBI Director James] ComeyÃÂs last-minute announcement that he was reopening his investigation of HillaryÃÂs emails was planned in advance by her Republican enemies. SheÃÂs also convinced that [Russian president Vladimir] Putin was working with Trump and that the two were in direct contact.

ÃÂShe further believes that a groundswell of anger is going to make it impossible for Trump to govern effectively,ÃÂ the source continued. ÃÂIn her view, Trump is a rank amateur in the art of politics, and heÃÂs going to screw up badly and find himself in deep trouble.

ÃÂShe told meÃÂand IÃÂm paraphrasing: ÃÂTrump has no idea what itÃÂs like to run the biggest corporation in the world, the United States government. He has no fÃÂÃÂg idea how complicated it is, how many cogs are spinning at the same time, how many people are fighting at cross purposes, how much disinformation you get.ÃÂÃÂ

According to sources close to Bill Clinton, he does not want Hillary to run again. Given his own serious health problems, Bill doubts he will be in any shape to help Hillary four years from now.

ÃÂBill hopes Hillary will see the light and change her mind,ÃÂ a source close to Bill said. ÃÂHeÃÂs sure the party will want a fresh new face come 2020.ÃÂ"	1
137	"I donÃÂt know about you, but IÃÂm getting tired of 2016 presidential election media coverage. ItÃÂs been a mess since the beginning, when Donald Trump kicked off his campaign with the statement that Mexicans are rapists, and major news channels and newspapers responded by giving him just what he wanted: more coverage than any other candidate.

For months I maintained the position that if we all stopped clicking on Donald Trump headlines, he would go away. But no one was interested in that strategy, and now itÃÂs too late to implement it. The media played a major role in Donald TrumpÃÂs rise to power, and now it seems as though they are rooting for him to maintain it.

Two weeks ago, a woman filed a federal lawsuit against Donald Trump, alleging that he raped her in 1994, when she was 13 years old. Also named as a defendant in the lawsuit is Jeffrey Epstein, a man who has already served a year in prison for soliciting an underage prostitute, and who was recently described by Donald Trump as a ÃÂterrific guy.ÃÂ

This story was first reported on June 20th by The Real Deal, a publication dedicated to covering New York real estate news. It was picked up by Gothamist, The Daily Beast, Snopes, and a few other websites. I did not learn about the case until a friend of mine shared this Huffington Post blog about it. The case was not covered in Huffington PostÃÂs news section, nor in the news section of any major publication.

Meanwhile, I received two New York Times push notifications this week with updates about Hillary ClintonÃÂs emails.

Has the media decided Donald Trump is just so despicable that it isnÃÂt worth covering another atrocity allegedly perpetrated by him, while Hillary Clinton is expected to be a perfect human being, so more coverage of her emails serves the public good? Have they decided Donald Trump is just so immune to negative coverage that reporting this lawsuit is a waste of time, while another story on HillaryÃÂs email server is guaranteed to make her even more unpopular?

Or, is giving credence to rape accusations against powerful men still socially unacceptable? (Re: Peyton Manning)

ItÃÂs difficult for me not to think that sexism has a hand in guiding the mediaÃÂs wacky priority list. I know a lot of people are getting tired of accusations of sexism in this presidential race, but sexism would explain why a female candidate sending emails from a private server faces a thousand times more public scrutiny than a male candidate allegedly raping a child.

To reiterate what has already been determined about HillaryÃÂs emails: Federal law did not prohibit public officials from using private email accounts until 2014, after she left office, and none of her emails were considered classified at the time she sent them via a private server. And yet, Hillary is branded a criminal, while Donald TrumpÃÂwho has now had three legal claims of sexual assault filed against himÃÂremains the successful businessman whose greatest offense is his ego. 

You can counter that the claims of sexual assault against Donald Trump are unproven in a court of law, and to that I will counter that Hillary has not been convicted of any crimes either. In this country, the principle of ÃÂinnocent until proven guiltyÃÂ tends to serve the privileged. That principle goes out the window when we discuss accusations against women and people of color.

Donald Trump may be a megalomaniac who has no experience in public office and has shocked the entire world by making it this far in the race, but the absurdity of his candidacy does not mean that he should be vetted less critically than his opponent. He may be a racist and a misogynist from whom we can never expect anything but the worst, but the reality is that heÃÂs one election away from being the most powerful person on the planet. If we dismiss his transgressions as just being typical of his character, we may allow him to actually hold that power in his hands.

To all the media gatekeepers out there: If you are frustrated by the fact that criticisms of Donald Trump do not dissuade his supporters in the slightest, I sympathize with you. But your frustration is not an excuse for failing to deliver those criticisms which Trump deserves. Perhaps this latest development would have no effect on TrumpÃÂs poll numbers, but it still needs to be covered. This is information that the public needs to know."	0
138	"NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂJust days after picking Betsy DeVos to run the Department of Education, President-elect Donald Trump has tapped another wealthy outsider by naming JoaquÃÂ­n GuzmÃÂ¡n, known as ÃÂEl Chapo,ÃÂ to head the Drug Enforcement Administration.

In an official statement, Trump said that El ChapoÃÂs ÃÂtremendous success in the private sectorÃÂ showed that he has what it takes to ÃÂshake things upÃÂ at the D.E.A.

TrumpÃÂs appointment of the former drug lord surprised many in Washington, in no small part because acrimony between the two allegedly prompted El Chapo, in 2015, to put a hundred-million-dollar bounty on TrumpÃÂs head.

But, appearing on CNN, the Trump surrogate Kellyanne Conway said that the selection of El Chapo should surprise no one. ÃÂMr. Trump always said that he would surround himself with the best people,ÃÂ she said.

When asked why Trump had readily offered a job to El Chapo while still mulling the fate of another former adversary, Mitt Romney, Conway said, ÃÂEl Chapo might not have voted for Mr. Trump, but thatÃÂs because heÃÂs Mexican and in jail, and Mitt Romney is neither.ÃÂ

The appointment of the former drug kingpin is far from a done deal, however, as associates of El Chapo report that he is ÃÂconcernedÃÂ that being a member of the Trump Administration would be bad for his brand."	0
139	"LOS ANGELES, Calif. ÃÂ Former first lady Nancy Reagan, who died on March 6 at the age of 94, remained mentally alert ÃÂuntil the very end,ÃÂ according to a private nurse, who told reporters Mrs. ReaganÃÂs last words to her were, ÃÂDo not vote for Donald Trump.ÃÂ

ÃÂShe watched all the [GOP] debates,ÃÂ said the nurse, identified as Althea Thoone. ÃÂShe was very alert and kept up with all the news and current events, especially about the election. She said no true Republican would cast a vote for Donald Trump.ÃÂ

ÃÂShe was not happy at all because I donÃÂt believe she thought Donald Trump was a real Republican. She took a turn for the worse after the [11th] debate when he started talking about his private parts, and all that other nonsense about Mitt Romney getting down on his knees.ÃÂ

During the debate held on March 4, Trump responded to RomneyÃÂs public attack against him by saying, ÃÂHe was begging for my endorsement. I could have said, ÃÂMitt, drop to your knees.ÃÂ He would have dropped to his knees.ÃÂ

Trump also alluded to the size of his penis during the debate, responding to a joke about the size of his hands told by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.

The so-called 11th Commandment, Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican, once espoused by Ronald Reagan, now seems to be a relic from the past, when a kinder, gentler political sensibility existed in Washington, at least between members of the same party.

ÃÂHe broke that commandment, and a few others too, as far as IÃÂm concerned,ÃÂ said Thoone, who became somewhat of a confidant to Mrs. Reagan in her last years. ÃÂShe remembered that crack he made about her not being ÃÂvery beautifulÃÂ too.ÃÂ

ÃÂI wouldnÃÂt say Donald Trump caused her to pass, because thatÃÂs up to the Lord, but he certainly didnÃÂt help any. She couldnÃÂt believe what she was seeing and hearing up there. She would just look over to me and shake her head.ÃÂ

Thoone reports that Mrs. Reagan hoped to attend at least one of the GOP debates, but the strain of travel and her advanced age prevented such a trip. She was happy to see George H.W. Bush and former first lady Barbara at the Feb. 25 debate, says Thoone.

Mrs. ReaganÃÂs last public appearance was on July 6, 2015, at her 94th birthday celebration."	1
140	"WASHINGTON -- Allegations of retaliation against a whistleblower at the National Security Agency have left its top watchdog fighting for his job, according to an intelligence official and another individual familiar with the case.

The case could offer some credence to Edward SnowdenÃÂs claim that he could not have reported the governmentÃÂs domestic surveillance program without facing reprisals.

George Ellard, the NSAÃÂs inspector general, was placed on administrative leave after he refused to give the whistleblower a certain job assignment. The Project on Government Oversight, an advocacy group, first reported last week that Adm. Mike Rogers, director of NSA, had placed Ellard on leave and recommended that he be terminated. Ellard is appealing that decision.

Ellard received attention in 2014 for remarks at Georgetown University Law Center criticizing Snowden, the former NSA contractor who had leaked secret documents about the surveillance program. Snowden says he went public because he feared retaliation from his superiors if he had raised his concerns with them. Ellard said at Georgetown that Snowden could have safely come to him.

EllardÃÂs case is the first to move completely through a process created by President Barack Obama in 2012 to ensure that intelligence employees can effectively report waste, fraud and abuse while protecting classified information. The directive prohibits agencies from retaliating against them or taking away security clearances or an employeeÃÂs access to classified information.

The case stemmed from a whistleblowerÃÂs claims of financial misconduct by NSA officials involving a conference in Nashville, Tennessee.

The whistleblower, in a brief email to The Associated Press, said that after he raised his concerns, his name was disclosed to Ellard in violation of rules intended to protect government employees who want to report misconduct.

The whistleblower said his email response had been cleared by the NSA. The agency declined to comment independently on the case. EllardÃÂs attorney did not respond to requests for comment.

ItÃÂs not clear who revealed the whistleblowerÃÂs identity to Ellard. But the whistleblower said that after Ellard learned who he was, ÃÂI was denied an assignment within the NSA inspector generalÃÂs office of investigations because of my whistleblowing.ÃÂ He sent the email to the AP on condition of anonymity because the case is still active.

RogersÃÂ decision to recommend EllardÃÂs dismissal followed an eight-month investigation by a panel of inspectors general at the CIA, Treasury and Justice Department, according to an intelligence official, who was not authorized to disclose details about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. The trio was empaneled in October 2015 and issued its decision in May.

The Justice and Defense departments declined to comment on the decision.

Louis Clark, director of the Government Accountability Project, said he was happy that the process set up by ObamaÃÂs directive was finally being used, but expressed disappointment that it has taken so long for it to happen. ÃÂIt was so slow because the intelligence agencies are extremely hostile to whistleblowing,ÃÂ he said.

The fate of ObamaÃÂs directive is uncertain. It will be up to Donald Trump, after he becomes president, to decide whether to continue it. Trump has said he doesnÃÂt trust the intelligence agencies, but itÃÂs not clear if that would make him more or less likely to protect whistleblowers.

Timothy Edgar, ObamaÃÂs first director of privacy and civil liberties for the White House national security staff, says there is cause for serious concern about the future of whistleblowers.

ÃÂWhat weÃÂre left with, I think, is probably primarily the integrity and bravery of people in the bureaucracy, who, despite those obstacles are willing to say ÃÂnoÃÂ if they are involved in activities that they think are serious violations of the Constitution,ÃÂ Edgar said."	0

The crowd, a democrat crowd mind you, was chanting ÃÂlock her up.ÃÂ Humiliated, shamed, and embarrassed Hillary refused to get out of her own car and attend her own damn event.

Wow thatÃÂs a shocker. A humiliating shocker, but a shocker nonetheless.

Anyone who follows this page will tell you that I painstakingly source my information. When I am wrong, I publicly admit it and post a retraction. That accuracy is one of the reasons that people follow this page.

I have personally verified this screenshot, taken from a Facebook post. (No, I will not post a screenshot of anything but the text. I do not want someone to get disciplined.)
It looks like things have gotten so bad for Hillary Clinton that she is bailing on her own rallies. Americans are finally starting to demand that the ruling class be held to the same standards asÃÂÃÂthe peasantsÃÂ.

If anyone has video of this event, please PM this page.

So we just finished up another escort for Hillary Clinton. When we arrived at the venue which was the Pompano Beach Amphitheater, there were so many people chanting ÃÂlock her upÃÂ she refused to exit her vehicle and left the venue.

This is the person people want to elect to face our enemies around the world and she wonÃÂt even face a crowd in her own Country."	1

Putin: Hacked Emails Reveal That Clinton Threatened SandersÃÂ Wife
Posted on July 29, 2016 by Baxter Dmitry in News, US // 0 Comments
The Kremlin claim the Clinton campaign 
   
Kremlin sources say the Clinton campaign ÃÂsent their goons to give Jane Sanders the shakedown,ÃÂ in order to end the Bernie Sanders campaign before the convention, citing evidence from one of 10,000 Hillary emails Putin has in his personal possession. 

The Clinton campaign needed Bernie Sanders on board before the emails were leaked as they contained evidence that confirmed his suggestions of Democratic establishment bias and would have given him unstoppable momentum heading into the convention ÃÂ had he chosen to play that game.

The Kremlin have threatened to release 20,000 emails that Russia have hacked from Hilary Clinton's email server.
Kremlin To Release 20,000 Hacked Hillary Clinton Emails

However after the meeting with the Clinton team Sanders unexpectedly suspended his previously gung-ho campaign, and although he refused to wholeheartedly endorse her, he signalled to his supporters that his run for President was effectively over.

Kremlin sources have denied the DNC claims that Russian state-sponsored hackers are behind the email leaks, with Julian Assange also stating the DNC claim is a politically motivated ÃÂlame conspiracy smear.ÃÂ

Despite the FBI asking the Kremlin for copies of any emails they have in their possession, it is understood the Kremlin has not released anything to anyone, including Wikileaks.

According to Kremlin sources, the source of the Wikileaks email trove could have come from ÃÂa huge number of possible sourcesÃÂ, as ÃÂintelligence communities around the whole world have copies of HillaryÃÂs emails. Everybody is talking about them.ÃÂ

Senior staff in the Kremlin have been allowed to see the emails, however Putin alone has access to them and keeps them on his personal laptop, under lock and key. He has been heard staying up until 2am, reading their contents out loud, roaring with laughter.

President Vladimir Putin is said to be amused by Democratic Party attempts to portray him as the villain, when their own failings are on display for all to see. ÃÂThey always need a babayka [boogeyman] to frighten people with. I am the Eastern boogeyman, it seems.ÃÂ

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reached out to the Kremlin, promising them ÃÂrewardsÃÂ if they release Hillary ClintonÃÂs missing emails.

ÃÂRussia, if youÃÂre listening, I hope youÃÂre able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing,ÃÂ Trump said on Wednesday.

ÃÂI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. LetÃÂs see if that happens. That will be next.ÃÂ

President Vladimir PutinÃÂs spokesman, while not directly denying Russian involvement in the hack, said Moscow would never interfere in another countryÃÂs election.

ÃÂPresident Putin more than once has said that Russia would never interfere and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, especially in the electoral process,ÃÂ Dmitry Peskov told journalists Wednesday in a conference call.

Peskov also criticized the willingness to accuse Russia of wrongdoing. ÃÂIf we talk about some sort of suspicions against a country, then it is necessary at a minimum to be precise and concrete,ÃÂ the spokesman said.

He said ÃÂspeculation in this case does not show a constructive attitude.ÃÂ"	1
143	"After publicly conceding electoral defeat last week, President Yahya Jammeh of Gambia has reversed course and is calling for a new election.

Jammeh has ruled the tiny West African country since seizing power in a coup in 1994, and his public concession to President-elect Adama Barrow on Dec. 2 led to hopes of the first peaceful transition of power in Gambia since it became independent from the U.K. in 1965.

On Friday, Jammeh said the Independent Electoral Commission made errors in vote tallies.

""In the same way that I accepted faithfully the results, believing that the IEC was independent and honest and reliable, I hereby reject the results in totality,"" Jammeh said in a televised speech.

He also said there were other irregularities and problems in the electoral process.

""Our investigations reveal that in some cases, voters were told that the opposition has already won and there was no need for them to vote,"" Jammeh said.

Last week, supporters of the opposition took to the streets to celebrate Barrow's win. Jammeh's allegations are now ""plunging Gambia into confusion and uncertainty,"" NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports.

President-elect Barrow responded, telling reporters, ""The outgoing president has no constitutional authority to reject the result of the election and order for fresh elections to be held,"" Reuters reports. ""I urge him to change his current position and accept the verdict of the people in good faith for the sake of the Gambia, our homeland, whose people deserve peace and freedom and prosperity,"" he added to The Associated Press.

The U.S. joined international bodies in condemning the announcement.

""This action is a reprehensible and unacceptable breach of faith with the people of The Gambia and an egregious attempt to undermine a credible election process and remain in power illegitimately,"" State Department spokesman Mark C. Toner said in a press release.

The Economic Community of West African States, the U.N. and African Union echoed the sentiment in a joint statement:

""They call on the government of The Gambia to abide by its constitutional responsibilities and international obligations. It is fundamental that the verdict of the ballots should be respected, and that the security of the president -elect Adama Barrow, and that of all Gambian citizen be fully ensured.""

Wire services report the streets of the capital Banjul were calm Saturday, with a heavy presence of police and soldiers. Gambians closed down shops and stayed home out of fear of violence.

Human rights groups have criticized Jammeh for abuses during his 22-year rule. In its 2016 report, Human Rights Watch said his government ""frequently committed serious human rights violations including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and torture against those who voiced opposition to the government,"" creating ""a climate of fear within Gambia.""

On Saturday, the organization retweeted a statement from deputy program director Babatunde Olugboji saying they were ""deeply concerned.""

Diplomats told Reuters that it's unclear what international organizations plan to do, but there is a precedent for military intervention. In 1981, they note, the surrounding country of Senegal sent in troops to stop a coup in Gambia.

Opposition leader Mai Ahmad Fatty urged calm. ""We are working round the clock to restore sanity,"" he told the AP. ""We have the full support of our people. The world is with us."""	0
144	"Authors Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince have released a bombshell report about former President Bill Clinton that could end HillaryÃÂs campaign!

In their new book, Bill & Hillary: So This is That Thing Called Love, the authors interview Clinton insiders who claim that Bill slept with so many women that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly forced him to get an HIV test from the doctor. This is because the former President ÃÂfavored unprotected sex.ÃÂ

And while the first tests came back negative, HIV and AIDS might explain an ongoing mystery. Over the years, both Clintons have kept their medical records a secret. Clinton has explained his rapidly changing appearance to his heart surgery and ÃÂnew dietÃÂ but he has looked increasingly thin and weak at Hillary campaign rallies.

As Rush Limbaugh opined, looking at Bill Clinton on the campaign trail,  Rush only sees Preparation H, Geritol, Fixodent, and Depends. Bill Clinton looks like his health is on a rapid recline.

Bill Clinton is roughly the same age as President George W. Bush. But while Bush looks healthy, Clinton only becomes older and frail.

Even a former Clinton White House advisor admits Bill looks unhealthy and ÃÂwashed-upÃÂ:

Former Bill Clinton advisor and television personality Dick Morris thinks his old boss isnÃÂt looking too good these days.
ÃÂI didnÃÂt recognize the character that was on TV,ÃÂ Morris said of Bill ClintonÃÂs recent interview with NBC News in a video released Monday. ÃÂHe was washed-out, he was listless, he was apathetic, he was very slow-talking and even slower thinking!ÃÂ

145	"President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is once again making accusations that the United States is directly supporting ISIS. HeÃÂs been mixed up in rumors of his supposed profiteering from the illicit ISIS oil trade in the past, so his accusations carry with them a need for healthy skepticism. Still, he is adamant in his allegations and says heÃÂs got irrefutable evidence.

His claims go beyond the single step of removal from direct involvement, our maintaining the implausible plausible deniability of aiding the so-called ÃÂfreedom fightersÃÂ or rebels, the insulation the US has relied upon in arming, training and financing ObamaÃÂs terrorist allies in the past. ItÃÂs more than an acknowledgment of the rebranding of ISIS terrorists, our supposed enemy, as anonymous factions under the White House subversive.

ItÃÂs beyond the contention of the Russians or the photographic evidence that John McCain was foolish enough to provide, what is basically little more than a choice in headscarf colors, the difference between their equivalent of the crips and the bloods, as being the ÃÂlegitimizing factorÃÂ for aiding our terrorist enemies as the non-existent moderate freedom fighters.

Erdogan said in his Tuesday comments that he has ÃÂconfirmed evidenceÃÂ that US-led forces have supported ISIS. Erdogan stated in no uncertain terms that ÃÂitÃÂs very clearÃÂ the US is supporting ISIS. He said, ÃÂThey were accusing us of supporting Daesh (ISIS). Now they give support to terrorist groups including Daesh, YPG, PYD. ItÃÂs very clear. We have confirmed evidence, with pictures, photos and videos.ÃÂ YPG and PYD are Kurdish groups that Erdogan regards as terrorists operating against Turkey.

Flanked by the visiting Guinean President Alpha Conde, Erdogan said, ÃÂThe coalition forces are unfortunately not keeping their promises. Whether they do or they donÃÂt, we will continue along this path in a determined way. There is no going back on the path we have set out on.ÃÂ

Erdogan complained ÃÂThey are supporting all the terror groups ÃÂ the YPG, PYD but also including Daesh (ISIS)  ItÃÂs quite clear, perfectly obvious,ÃÂ he said, adding that Turkey could provide proof in pictures and video. During a November visit to Pakistan Erdogan made similar claims, alleging ÃÂthe West stands by Daesh (ISIS) right nowÃÂ and its weapons were Western-made. At the time he declined to provide his evidence for inspection.

He needs to be more forthcoming this time around. If heÃÂs got the evidence, show it. Certainly none of us would be surprised to learn that Obama is behind ISIS, itÃÂs already well known. We would like to put our hands on his proof, though, in order to properly charge Obama and convict him."	1
146	"Let us now address the greatest American mystery at the moment: what motivates the supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump?

I call it a ÃÂmysteryÃÂ because the working-class white people who make up the bulk of TrumpÃÂs fan base show up in amazing numbers for the candidate, filling stadiums and airport hangars, but their views, by and large, do not appear in our prestige newspapers. On their opinion pages, these publications take care to represent demographic categories of nearly every kind, but ÃÂblue-collarÃÂ is one they persistently overlook. The views of working-class people are so foreign to that universe that when New York Times columnist Nick Kristof wanted to ÃÂengageÃÂ a Trump supporter last week, he made one up, along with this imaginary personÃÂs responses to his questions.

When members of the professional class wish to understand the working-class Other, they traditionally consult experts on the subject. And when these authorities are asked to explain the Trump movement, they always seem to zero in on one main accusation: bigotry. Only racism, they tell us, is capable of powering a movement like TrumpÃÂs, which is blowing through the inherited structure of the Republican party like a tornado through a cluster of McMansions.

Trump himself provides rather excellent evidence for this finding. The man is an insult clown who has systematically gone down the list of American ethnic groups and offended them each in turn. He wants to deport millions upon millions of undocumented immigrants. He wants to bar Muslims from visiting the United States. He admires various foreign strongmen and dictators, and has even retweeted a quote from Mussolini. This gold-plated buffoon has in turn drawn the enthusiastic endorsement of leading racists from across the spectrum of intolerance, a gorgeous mosaic of haters, each of them quivering excitedly at the prospect of getting a real, honest-to-god bigot in the White House.


All this stuff is so insane, so wildly outrageous, that the commentariat has deemed it to be the entirety of the Trump campaign. Trump appears to be a racist, so racism must be what motivates his armies of followers. And so, on Saturday, New York Times columnist Timothy Egan blamed none other than ÃÂthe peopleÃÂ for TrumpÃÂs racism: ÃÂDonald TrumpÃÂs supporters know exactly what he stands for: hatred of immigrants, racial superiority, a sneering disregard of the basic civility that binds a society.ÃÂ

Stories marveling at the stupidity of Trump voters are published nearly every day. Articles that accuse TrumpÃÂs followers of being bigots have appeared by the hundreds, if not the thousands. Conservatives have written them; liberals have written them; impartial professionals have written them. The headline of a recent Huffington Post column announced, bluntly, that ÃÂTrump Won Super Tuesday Because America is Racist.ÃÂ A New York Times reporter proved that TrumpÃÂs followers were bigots by coordinating a map of Trump support with a map of racist Google searches. Everyone knows it: TrumpÃÂs followersÃÂ passions are nothing more than the ignorant blurtings of the white American id, driven to madness by the presence of a black man in the White House. The Trump movement is a one-note phenomenon, a vast surge of race-hate. Its partisans are not only incomprehensible, they are not really worth comprehending.

Or so weÃÂre told. Last week, I decided to watch several hours of Trump speeches for myself. I saw the man ramble and boast and threaten and even seem to gloat when protesters were ejected from the arenas in which he spoke. I was disgusted by these things, as I have been disgusted by Trump for 20 years. But I also noticed something surprising. In each of the speeches I watched, Trump spent a good part of his time talking about an entirely legitimate issue, one that could even be called leftwing.

Yes, Donald Trump talked about trade. In fact, to judge by how much time he spent talking about it, trade may be his single biggest concern ÃÂ not white supremacy. Not even his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, the issue that first won him political fame. He did it again during the debate on 3 March: asked about his political excommunication by Mitt Romney, he chose to pivot and talk about ÃÂ trade.

It seems to obsess him: the destructive free-trade deals our leaders have made, the many companies that have moved their production facilities to other lands, the phone calls he will make to those companiesÃÂ CEOs in order to threaten them with steep tariffs unless they move back to the US.

Trump embellished this vision with another favorite leftwing idea: under his leadership, the government would ÃÂstart competitive bidding in the drug industryÃÂ. (ÃÂWe donÃÂt competitively bid!ÃÂ he marveled ÃÂ another true fact, a legendary boondoggle brought to you by the George W Bush administration.) Trump extended the critique to the military-industrial complex, describing how the government is forced to buy lousy but expensive airplanes thanks to the power of industry lobbyists.

Thus did he hint at his curious selling proposition: because he is personally so wealthy, a fact about which he loves to boast, Trump himself is unaffected by business lobbyists and donations. And because he is free from the corrupting power of modern campaign finance, famous deal-maker Trump can make deals on our behalf that are ÃÂgoodÃÂ instead of ÃÂbadÃÂ. The chance that he will actually do so, of course, is small. He appears to be a hypocrite on this issue as well as so many other things. But at least Trump is saying this stuff.

All this surprised me because, for all the articles about Trump I had read in recent months, I didnÃÂt recall trade coming up very often. Trump is supposed to be on a one-note crusade for whiteness. Could it be that all this trade stuff is a key to understanding the Trump phenomenon?

* * *
Trade is an issue that polarizes Americans by socio-economic status. To the professional class, which encompasses the vast majority of our media figures, economists, Washington officials and Democratic powerbrokers, what they call ÃÂfree tradeÃÂ is something so obviously good and noble it doesnÃÂt require explanation or inquiry or even thought. Republican and Democratic leaders alike agree on this, and no amount of facts can move them from their Econ 101 dream.

To the remaining 80 or 90% of America, trade means something very different. ThereÃÂs a video going around on the internet these days that shows a room full of workers at a Carrier air conditioning plant in Indiana being told by an officer of the company that the factory is being moved to Monterrey, Mexico, and that theyÃÂre all going to lose their jobs.

As I watched it, I thought of all the arguments over trade that weÃÂve had in this country since the early 1990s, all the sweet words from our economists about the scientifically proven benevolence of free trade, all the ways in which our newspapers mock people who say that treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement allow companies to move jobs to Mexico.

Well, here is a video of a company moving its jobs to Mexico, courtesy of Nafta. This is what it looks like. The Carrier executive talks in that familiar and highly professional HR language about the need to ÃÂstay competitiveÃÂ and ÃÂthe extremely price-sensitive marketplaceÃÂ. A worker shouts ÃÂFuck you!ÃÂ at the executive. The executive asks people to please be quiet so he can ÃÂshareÃÂ his ÃÂinformationÃÂ. His information about all of them losing their jobs.

Now, I have no special reason to doubt the suspicion that Donald Trump is a racist. Either he is one, or (as the comedian John Oliver puts it) he is pretending to be one, which amounts to the same thing.

But there is another way to interpret the Trump phenomenon. A map of his support may coordinate with racist Google searches, but it coordinates even better with deindustrialization and despair, with the zones of economic misery that 30 years of WashingtonÃÂs free-market consensus have brought the rest of America.

It is worth noting that Trump is making a point of assailing that Indiana air conditioning company from the video in his speeches. What this suggests is that heÃÂs telling a tale as much about economic outrage as it is tale of racism on the march. Many of TrumpÃÂs followers are bigots, no doubt, but many more are probably excited by the prospect of a president who seems to mean it when he denounces our trade agreements and promises to bring the hammer down on the CEO that fired you and wrecked your town, unlike Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

Here is the most salient supporting fact: when people talk to white, working-class Trump supporters, instead of simply imagining what they might say, they find that what most concerns these people is the economy and their place in it. I am referring to a study just published by Working America, a political-action auxiliary of the AFL-CIO, which interviewed some 1,600 white working-class voters in the suburbs of Cleveland and Pittsburgh in December and January.

Support for Donald Trump, the group found, ran strong among these people, even among self-identified Democrats, but not because they are all pining for a racist in the White House. Their favorite aspect of Trump was his ÃÂattitudeÃÂ, the blunt and forthright way he talks. As far as issues are concerned, ÃÂimmigrationÃÂ placed third among the matters such voters care about, far behind their number one concern: ÃÂgood jobs / the economyÃÂ.

ÃÂPeople are much more frightened than they are bigoted,ÃÂ is how the findings were described to me by Karen Nussbaum, the executive director of Working America. The survey ÃÂconfirmed what we heard all the time: people are fed up, people are hurting, they are very distressed about the fact that their kids donÃÂt have a futureÃÂ and that ÃÂthere still hasnÃÂt been a recovery from the recession, that every family still suffers from it in one way or another.ÃÂ

Tom Lewandowski, the president of the Northeast Indiana Central Labor Council in Fort Wayne, puts it even more bluntly when I asked him about working-class Trump fans. ÃÂThese people arenÃÂt racist, not any more than anybody else is,ÃÂ he says of Trump supporters he knows. ÃÂWhen Trump talks about trade, we think about the Clinton administration, first with Nafta and then with [Permanent Normal Trade Relations] China, and here in Northeast Indiana, we hemorrhaged jobs.ÃÂ

ÃÂThey look at that, and hereÃÂs Trump talking about trade, in a ham-handed way, but at least heÃÂs representing emotionally. WeÃÂve had all the political establishment standing behind every trade deal, and we endorsed some of these people, and then weÃÂve had to fight them to get them to represent us.ÃÂ

Now, let us stop and smell the perversity. Left parties the world over were founded to advance the fortunes of working people. But our left party in America ÃÂ one of our two monopoly parties ÃÂ chose long ago to turn its back on these peopleÃÂs concerns, making itself instead into the tribune of the enlightened professional class, a ÃÂcreative classÃÂ that makes innovative things like derivative securities and smartphone apps. The working people that the party used to care about, Democrats figured, had nowhere else to go, in the famous Clinton-era expression. The party just didnÃÂt need to listen to them any longer.

What Lewandowski and Nussbaum are saying, then, should be obvious to anyone whoÃÂs dipped a toe outside the prosperous enclaves on the two coasts. Ill-considered trade deals and generous bank bailouts and guaranteed profits for insurance companies but no recovery for average people, ever ÃÂ these policies have taken their toll. As Trump says, ÃÂwe have rebuilt China and yet our country is falling apart. Our infrastructure is falling apart ÃÂ Our airports are, like, Third World.ÃÂ

TrumpÃÂs words articulate the populist backlash against liberalism that has been building slowly for decades and may very well occupy the White House itself, whereupon the entire world will be required to take seriously its demented ideas.

Yet still we cannot bring ourselves to look the thing in the eyes. We cannot admit that we liberals bear some of the blame for its emergence, for the frustration of the working-class millions, for their blighted cities and their downward spiraling lives. So much easier to scold them for their twisted racist souls, to close our eyes to the obvious reality of which Trumpism is just a crude and ugly expression: that neoliberalism has well and truly failed.

Some Evangelical Christians are beginning to hold presumed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in high esteem. Several Evangelicals, including walking gaffe former Rep. Michelle Bachmann, already believe Trump, the thrice married, casino magnate, who appeared on the cover of Playboy, has been ordained by God.

But televangelist Pat Robertson has taken it one step further. He believes Trump is on par with Jesus Christ.

ÃÂGod came to me in a dream last night and showed me the future,ÃÂ said Robertson. ÃÂHe took me to heaven and I saw Donald Trump seated at the right hand of our Lord.ÃÂ

According to Raw Story, Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, a 12,000-member megachurch, said Trump would make a better candidate than Jesus.

ÃÂYou know, I was debating an evangelical professor on NPR, and this professor said, ÃÂPastor, donÃÂt you want a candidate who embodies the teaching of Jesus and would govern this country according to the principles found in the Sermon on the Mount?ÃÂÃÂ said Jeffress. ÃÂI said, ÃÂHeck no.ÃÂ I would run from that candidate as far as possible, because the Sermon on the Mount was not given as a governing principle for this nation.ÃÂ

ÃÂWhen IÃÂm looking for somebody whoÃÂs going to deal with ISIS and exterminate ISIS, I donÃÂt care about that candidateÃÂs tone or vocabulary, I want the meanest, toughest, son of a you-know-what I can find ÃÂ and I believe thatÃÂs biblical,ÃÂ said Jeffress.

148	"Two years ago, Jonathan Clark was sending his four school-age kids to four different schools in Detroit.

ÃÂWe were driving 200 miles a week just to and from school,ÃÂ he said. His three oldest ÃÂ all girls, ages 14 to 16 ÃÂ were enrolled at charters, privately run schools funded by the government that promise better educational outcomes.

Clark was able to send his kids to schools all over the city because of school choice, the policy that allows kids to get educated outside their home district. But Clark said the conditions at these charter schools were no different from whatÃÂs typical of a public school in Detroit: a lack of resources needed to educate students, high teacher turnover, and low test scores.

ÃÂThese are all things they give bad marks to DPS [Detroit public schools] on,ÃÂ he said, ÃÂbut charters are doing the same.ÃÂ

ThatÃÂs why Clark is alarmed by Donald TrumpÃÂs nomination of Betsy DeVos to lead the US Department of Education.

DeVos, a billionaire and conservative activist from the state, has been one of the strongest defenders in Michigan of expanding charter schools and choice.

DeVos and her husband, Dick, have long been a force in education policy efforts in Michigan, as well as other sensitive political issues ÃÂ such as the Michigan legislatureÃÂs 2012 decision to pass right-to-work legislation. The DeVoses have contributed at least $7m to state lawmakers and MichiganÃÂs GOP party ÃÂ including support for a failed $5m effort to pass a pro-school-voucher voter referendum in 2000.

Public education advocates who oppose DeVosÃÂs nomination point to MichiganÃÂs education record ÃÂ particularly in Detroit, where nearly half of students attend charters.

Since a quarter-century ago, charter advocates have pursued an agenda that has included a lift on the cap for how many can open in the state, as well as an expansion of school choice. Along the way, the stateÃÂs academic performance has dropped, and Detroit has probably felt the biggest impact.

Though charter advocates point to studies that suggest student gains have been made at charters, the cityÃÂs disconnected array of schools has developed into a frenetic status quo. Just this year, the district has teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, prompting teachers facing potential payless work days to stage mass protests, and a federal lawsuit is now attempting to assert a constitutional right to literacy ÃÂ an argument couched in the dismal performance scores of Detroit students.

WhatÃÂs more, the stateÃÂs policies and regulation of charters has been so lax, critics routinely refer to the cityÃÂs educational landscape as the ÃÂwild westÃÂ. Indeed, a federal audit this year noted MichiganÃÂs charter school law does not include provisions for regulating conflict-of-interest issues. The state also allows for-profit charters to be established, a practice prohibited elsewhere.

Since 1990, DetroitÃÂs population has dropped nearly 35%, while its school districtÃÂs attendance has plummeted nearly 75% ÃÂ a signal of the proliferation of charters and use of choice in the city.

The situation in Michigan is such that even charter advocates criticize the stateÃÂs approach ÃÂ and DeVosÃÂs devotion to maintaining it.

ÃÂIt doesnÃÂt matter that charter schools arenÃÂt giving any of the things they promised 22 years ago,ÃÂ said Stephen Henderson, a Detroit native and editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, who, along with his two children, attended charters. ÃÂShe ... and her family funds any effort to block any changes or accountability or standards that would perhaps produce better results for us.ÃÂ

But the pick underscored the polarizing views of DeVos. In her home state, MichiganÃÂs governor and attorney general echoed TrumpÃÂs remarks about her qualifications.

Dan Quisenberry, president of the Michigan Association of Public School Academies, downplayed criticisms of her background, saying her business experience and previous role as the Michigan GOP chairwoman showed she could lead a large organization and handle political issues.

ÃÂBetsy is a person who will put kids before adults,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂSheÃÂs going to put students and parents ahead of politics.ÃÂ

Michigan indeed has some high-performing charter schools, including in Detroit. Many supporters point to a 2013 Stanford study that found charter students in the state learned at a faster rate than those in public schools, with two months of gains, or three months in Detroit. Still, the study found that slightly more than half of Detroit charter schools failed to perform ÃÂsignificantly betterÃÂ in math and reading than counterparts, some even worse.

This summer, charter school advocates ÃÂ including DeVosÃÂs group, the Great Lakes Education Project ÃÂ agreed to some additional accountability measures as part of a $617m investment to overhaul the governance of Detroit public schools. Schools must now be assessed regularly, and new schools accredited.

But a provision to create a commission overseeing Detroit schools was stripped from the legislation after intense lobbying by charter advocates and DeVos.

ÃÂWhat they feared was the accountability,ÃÂ Henderson, 46, said.

DeVos ÃÂ whose father-in-law founded Amway, a marketing company that previously settled tax fraud accusations for $25m ÃÂ has long leveraged her wealth to target Republicans who have not boosted her education agenda. After the commission was derailed, DeVos donated $1.45m to state Republican lawmakers over a two month period.

Henderson said GOP lawmakers had told him that in the runup to the decision to axe the Detroit commission, DeVos explicitly stated that she wouldnÃÂt donate to their campaign efforts if they didnÃÂt flip their votes on the issue.

TrumpÃÂs transition team declined to make DeVos available for an interview and did not provide comment for this story.

Quisenberry said critics ÃÂ namely, teachersÃÂ unions ÃÂ who point to DeVosÃÂ political influence usually ÃÂare involved very much in the same influence on the other sideÃÂ

ÃÂWhat the [Detroit commission] was about was whose political influence was going to win out,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂThe teachersÃÂ union was very involved.ÃÂ

Clark believes the commission would have addressed the distribution and quality of of schools in the city - in his neighborhood, there is just one operational school for 3,000 kids.

ÃÂIf schools in our neighborhood were open, and up to standards, and producing a quality educational experience, then we wouldnÃÂt have had to go to four different schools all over the city,ÃÂ Clark said.

Clark now sends his three older kids to private school. But he knows that is off the table for many other parents in the city, where 40% of residents live below the poverty line.

ÃÂWhat about the parents who arenÃÂt in that position?ÃÂ"	0
149	"After protests erupted in Chicago that led to the cancellation of a Donald Trump rally at the University of Illinois-Chicago Pavilion, the controversial Republican candidate has filed a lawsuit against the city for prohibiting his First Amendment right to free speech.    

ÃÂMy free speech right was infringed last Friday in Chicago and thatÃÂs what it will say in the lawsuit,ÃÂ Trump told reporters. ÃÂWeÃÂll be asking for a monetary settlement and for those protestors to be prosecuted. It was very, very wrong of them. I do not condone violence. IÃÂm very against violence, especially at my campaign events.ÃÂ

TrumpÃÂs attorneys drew extensive papers on the lawsuit and are filled on Monday. A Chicago judge will review them by next week.

ÃÂChicago violated my First Amendment right and they arenÃÂt going to get away with it. Just like China wonÃÂt get away with stealing our jobs and manipulating their currency.ÃÂ

The campaign thinks a conspiracy might be involved with the anti-trump protesters. ÃÂWhen the cops saw a bunch of black people entering my rally, they knew they shouldnÃÂt be there but let them in anyway. I mean, what the Hell is that?ÃÂ

Trump then went after ChicagoÃÂs Mayor Rahm Emanuel. ÃÂI know Rahm thinks heÃÂs a tough guy, but heÃÂll be a mouse looking for his mom by the time I get done with him. He makes ÃÂLittle RubioÃÂ look like a giant.  A New Yorker will beat a Chicagoan every time. Believe me, he is going to regret not having his city under control.

He was terrible as ObamaÃÂs Chief of Staff and heÃÂs been a terrible Mayor. Look at the gang problem and the cities credit rating.

ÃÂIÃÂm happy Nabisco closed that Chicago factory and moved it to Mexico. I was against it before, but after tonight, IÃÂm totally for it.ÃÂ

The Mayor  

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel1 called the lawsuit ÃÂfrivolousÃÂ and ÃÂridiculous.ÃÂ

ÃÂYou canÃÂt have a presidential candidate going around suing cities because the local people donÃÂt like the guy,ÃÂ Emanuel told the Chicago Tribune. ÃÂThe city is in massive debt and the last thing we need is to be tied up in court for years to come cause we know Trump loves to sue people. Legal fees arenÃÂt cheap.ÃÂ

Trump claimed the Chicago Police Department told him to call off the event but they responded by saying it was TrumpÃÂs campaign that called off the event and the Chicago Police did not infringe on his free speech right.

ÃÂIf Trump thinks he can bully the City of Chicago, heÃÂs got another thing coming.ÃÂ"	1
150	"Michelle Obama in a candid interview with Oprah Winfrey opened up for the first time publicly about the 2016 presidential campaign, calling it ""challenging"" for her ""as a citizen to watch and experience.""

The first lady said it was important ""for the health of this nation"" that she and her husband, President Barack Obama, support President-elect Donald Trump, even though she said some political leaders didn't support her husband's presidency.

""So we're going to be there for the next president and do whatever we have to do to make sure that he is successful, because if he succeeds, we all succeed,"" Obama told Winfrey during her final one-on-one White House interview, which aired Monday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.

In the one-hour program, Obama reflected on her eight years as first lady, discussing topics including her surprise at being called an ""angry black woman"" during her husband's 2007 presidential campaign and Trump's comments about women.

""For all the people out there, they have to understand that, as I've said time and time again, words matter,"" she said. ""And they matter most to our kids, our young people. And the words that we say moving forward, all of us, it matters, which is one of the reasons why Barack and I are so supportive of this transition.""

Obama also put to rest speculation she would run for president, citing the strain it would place on her family.

""Sixteen years, I wouldn't do that to my kids because what people don't understand is that you run, their lives stop, at any age,"" she said. ""The next family that comes in here, every person in that family, every child, every grandchild, their lives will be turned upside down in a way that no American really understands.""

Winfrey also asked about Trump's post-election visit to the White House.

""It was very pleasant,"" she said. ""It was a wonderful visit because this is a really great job.""

Obama said she and Melania Trump talked about the kids and said she told the incoming first lady that her ""door is open"" for any questions.

""My offer to Melania was you really don't know what you don't know until you're here, so the door is open as I've told her,"" Obama said, adding that she's modeling what the Bushes had done for her.

Obama also took time to reflect on her accomplishments, saying she thinks she moved the needle on childhood obesity and changed the conversation on how Americans look at the military.

President Barack Obama also made an appearance during the interview, discussing what surprised him about how his wife filled the role of first lady.

""We all knew she was brilliant and cute and strong and a great mom,"" the president said. ""But I think the way in which she blended purpose and policy with fun, so that she was able to reach beyond Washington on her healthcare initiatives, on her military family work, was masterful.""

Michelle Obama said she and her husband have grown closer in the last eight years, but added that her biggest sacrifice has been anonymity. She said she wasn't sure if she's ready to be a private citizen.

""There's nowhere I can go in the world and just sit at a table and have a cup of coffee and watch the world,"" she said.

Toward the end, Winfrey returned to a question she had put to Michelle Obama eight years earlier, when she asked about Obama's prayers for her family.

Obama's response at the time, Winfrey said, was that ""we remain whole.""

""So now, I ask you, what is your prayer for our country?"" Winfrey continued.

""It's hope,"" Obama replied. ""My desire for this country is that we remain hopeful and that we find a place in our hearts to love each other. It's really simple ÃÂ just opening up our hearts to others, making room."""	0
151	"Congressional Republicans have largely sought to minimize differences between President-elect Donald Trump and GOP establishment orthodoxy on a variety of issues, but signs of tension have begun to emerge over U.S. relations with Russia.

Over two days, Republicans in the Senate have publicly disagreed with or questioned decisions and statements made by Trump amidst rising tensions and allegations of Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election.

It's a different tact than Republicans have taken on disagreements over domestic policy. Elected officials in Congress have either downplayed division or stayed silent on issues of infrastructure spending, trade and entitlement reform.

But since Trump's announcement of his intention to appoint ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of State, at least four Senate Republicans have indicated that Tillerson should have to answer tough questions about his views on Russia and what is considered to be his close relationship with President Vladimir Putin.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C , said he has ""many questions"" for Tillerson. ""I expect the US-Russian relationship to be front and center in his confirmation process,"" he said in a statement.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said he has ""serious concerns about his nomination.""

""The next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America's interests, and will be a forceful advocate for America's foreign policy goals to the president, within the administration, and on the world stage,"" Rubio added.

And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told NBC News he also has concerns over Tillerson's ties with Russia and that it would be the subject of the confirmation hearings.

Likely to be dissected during the confirmation process is Tillerson's business interests and questions of how he would deal with any possible conflict. ExxonMobile is set to make hundreds of billions of dollars, for instance, if sanctions are lifted from Russia placed on the country after their invasion of Ukraine and Crimea.

""Whose interest is served by that?"" asked House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell Reports Tuesday.

Concern over Tillerson comes just one day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he backs a Senate investigation into the Russian hacking of U.S. political entities, including the Democratic National Committee.

While McConnell said that oversight of Russia must not become a partisan issue, he added that Republicans have always been critical of Russia.

""It defies belief that somehow republicans in the senate are reluctant to either review Russian tactics or ignore them,"" McConnell said.

But the incoming Republican president has espoused a dramatically different view of Russia. He complimented Putin throughout the campaign and has said that he'd like a more friendly and cooperative relationship with the country that 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called the United States' main geopolitical threat.

""This is one of these times when one party controls both the executive branch and two houses of Congress, but they're not in sync with the policy agenda. So it's a real question of if partisan loyalty overtakes substantive policy and personal prerogatives,"" Schmitt said.

152	"There is a smug style in American liberalism. It has been growing these past decades. It is a way of conducting politics, predicated on the belief that American life is not divided by moral difference or policy divergence ÃÂ not really ÃÂ but by the failure of half the country to know what's good for them.

In 2016, the smug style has found expression in media and in policy, in the attitudes of liberals both visible and private, providing a foundational set of assumptions above which a great number of liberals comport their understanding of the world.

It has led an American ideology hitherto responsible for a great share of the good accomplished over the past century of our political life to a posture of reaction and disrespect: a condescending, defensive sneer toward any person or movement outside of its consensus, dressed up as a monopoly on reason.

The smug style is a psychological reaction to a profound shift in American political demography.

Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, the working class, once the core of the coalition, began abandoning the Democratic Party. In 1948, in the immediate wake of Franklin Roosevelt, 66 percent of manual laborers voted for Democrats, along with 60 percent of farmers. In 1964, it was 55 percent of working-class voters. By 1980, it was 35 percent.

The white working class in particular saw even sharper declines. Despite historic advantages with both poor and middle-class white voters, by 2012 Democrats possessed only a 2-point advantage among poor white voters. Among white voters making between $30,000 and $75,000 per year, the GOP has taken a 17-point lead.

Finding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful, hapless rubes, smug liberals created a culture animated by that contempt
The consequence was a shift in liberalism's intellectual center of gravity. A movement once fleshed out in union halls and little magazines shifted into universities and major press, from the center of the country to its cities and elite enclaves. Minority voters remained, but bereft of the material and social capital required to dominate elite decision-making, they were largely excluded from an agenda driven by the new Democratic core: the educated, the coastal, and the professional.

It is not that these forces captured the party so much as it fell to them. When the laborer left, they remained.

The origins of this shift are overdetermined. Richard Nixon bears a large part of the blame, but so does Bill Clinton. The Southern Strategy, yes, but the destruction of labor unions, too. I have my own sympathies, but I do not propose to adjudicate that question here.

Suffice it to say, by the 1990s the better part of the working class wanted nothing to do with the word liberal. What remained of the American progressive elite was left to puzzle: What happened to our coalition?

Why did they abandon us?

What's the matter with Kansas?

The smug style arose to answer these questions. It provided an answer so simple and so emotionally satisfying that its success was perhaps inevitable: the theory that conservatism, and particularly the kind embraced by those out there in the country, was not a political ideology at all.

How politics makes us stupid

The trouble is that stupid hicks don't know what's good for them. They're getting conned by right-wingers and tent revivalists until they believe all the lies that've made them so wrong. They don't know any better. That's why they're voting against their own self-interest.

As anybody who has gone through a particularly nasty breakup knows, disdain cultivated in the aftermath of a divide quickly exceeds the original grievance. You lose somebody. You blame them. Soon, the blame is reason enough to keep them at a distance, the excuse to drive them even further away.

Finding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful, hapless rubes, smug liberals created a culture animated by that contempt. The result is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Financial incentive compounded this tendency ÃÂ there is money, after all, in reassuring the bitter. Over 20 years, an industry arose to cater to the smug style. It began in humor, and culminated for a time in The Daily Show, a program that more than any other thing advanced the idea that liberal orthodoxy was a kind of educated savvy and that its opponents were, before anything else, stupid. The smug liberal found relief in ridiculing them.

The internet only made it worse. Today, a liberal who finds himself troubled by the currents of contemporary political life need look no further than his Facebook newsfeed to find the explanation:

Study finds Daily Show viewers more informed than viewers of Fox News.


They're beating CNN watchers too.

NPR listeners are best informed of all. He likes that.

You're better off watching nothing than watching Fox. He likes that even more.

The good news doesn't stop.

Liberals aren't just better informed. They're smarter.

They've got better grammar. They know more words.

Smart kids grow up to be liberals, while conservatives reason like drunks.

Liberals are better able to process new information; they're less biased like that. They've got different brains. Better ones. Why? Evolution. They've got better brains, top-notch amygdalae, science finds.

The smug style created a feedback loop. If the trouble with conservatives was ignorance, then the liberal impulse was to correct it. When such corrections failed, disdain followed after it.

Of course, there is a smug style in every political movement: elitism among every ideology believing itself in possession of the solutions to society's ills. But few movements have let the smug tendency so corrupt them, or make so tenuous its case against its enemies.

""Conservatives are always at a bit of a disadvantage in the theater of mass democracy,"" the conservative editorialist Kevin Williamson wrote in National Review last October, ""because people en masse aren't very bright or sophisticated, and they're vulnerable to cheap, hysterical emotional appeals.""

The smug style thinks Williamson is wrong, of course, but not in principle. It's only that he's confused about who the hordes of stupid, hysterical people are voting for. The smug style reads Williamson and says, ""No! You!""

Elites, real elites, might recognize one another by their superior knowledge. The smug recognize one another by their mutual knowing.

Knowing, for example, that the Founding Fathers were all secular deists. Knowing that you're actually, like, 30 times more likely to shoot yourself than an intruder. Knowing that those fools out in Kansas are voting against their own self-interest and that the trouble is Kansas doesn't know any better. Knowing all the jokes that signal this knowledge.

The studies, about Daily Show viewers and better-sized amygdalae, are knowing. It is the smug style's first premise: a politics defined by a command of the Correct Facts and signaled by an allegiance to the Correct Culture. A politics that is just the politics of smart people in command of Good Facts. A politics that insists it has no ideology at all, only facts. No moral convictions, only charts, the kind that keep them from ""imposing their morals"" like the bad guys do.

Knowing is the shibboleth into the smug style's culture, a cultural that celebrates hip commitments and valorizes hip taste, that loves nothing more than hate-reading anyone who doesn't get them. A culture that has come to replace politics itself.

The knowing know that police reform, that abortion rights, that labor unions are important, but go no further: What is important, after all, is to signal that you know these things. What is important is to launch links and mockery at those who don't. The Good Facts are enough: Anybody who fails to capitulate to them is part of the Problem, is terminally uncool. No persuasion, only retweets. Eye roll, crying emoji, forward to John Oliver for sick burns.

The smug style has always existed in American liberalism, but it wasn't always so totalizing. Lionel Trilling claimed, as far back as 1950, that liberalism ""is not only the dominant, but even the sole intellectual tradition,"" that ""the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse ... do not express themselves in ideas, but only in action or in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.""

The smug style has always existed in American liberalism, but it wasn't always so totalizing
Richard Hofstadter, the historian whose most famous work, The Paranoid Style in American Politics, this essay exists in some obvious reference to, advanced a similar line in writing not so well-remembered today. His then-influential history writing drips with disdain for rubes who regard themselves as victimized by economics and history, who have failed to maintain correct political attitudes.

But 60 years ago, American liberalism relied too much on the support of working people to let these ideas take too much hold. Even its elitists, its Schlesingers and Bells, were tempered by the power of the labor movement, by the role Marxism still played in even liberal politics ÃÂ forces too powerful to allow non-elite concerns to entirely escape the liberal mental horizon. Walter Reuther, and Bayard Rustin, and A. Philip Randolph were still in the room, and they mattered.


Sixty years ago, the ugliest tendencies were still private, too. The smug style belonged to real elites, knowing in their cocktail parties, far from the ears of rubes. But today we have television, and the internet, and a liberalism worked out in universities and think tanks. Today, the better part of liberalism is Trillings ÃÂ or those who'd like to be, at any rate ÃÂ and everyone can hear them.

On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court found that denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples constituted a violation of the 14th Amendment. After decades of protests, legislation, setbacks, and litigation, the 13 states still holding out against the inevitable were ordered to relent. Kim Davis, a clerk tasked with issuing marriage licenses to couples in her Kentucky county, refused.

At the distance of six months, it is surprising that she was, beyond a few short-lived and empty efforts, the only civil bureaucrat to do so. One imagines a hundred or a thousand Kim Davises in the country, small administrators with small power, outraged by the collapse of a moral fight that they were winning just a few years prior.

In the days between the June decision and the July 1 announcement that the American Civil Liberties Union would represent four couples who had been denied marriage licenses by the Rowan County Clerk's office, many braced for resistance. Surely compliance would come hard in some places. Surely, some of the losers would refuse to give up. There was something giddy about it ÃÂ at long last, the good guys would be the ones bearing down with the full force of the law.

It did not take long for the law to correct Davis. On August 12, a judge ordered a stay, preventing Davis from refusing any further under the protection of the law. The Sixth Circuit, and then the Supreme Court, refused to hear her appeal.

Despite further protest and Davis's ultimate jailing for contempt of court, normal service was restored in short order. The 23,000 people of Rowan Country suffered, all told, slightly less than seven weeks without a functioning civil licensure apparatus.

Davis remained a fixation. Dour, rural, thrice divorced but born again ÃÂ Twitter could not have invented a better parody of the uncool. She was ridiculed for her politics but also for her looks ÃÂ that she had been married so many times was inexplicable! That she thought she had the slightest grasp of the Constitution, doubly so.

When Davis was jailed for five days following her refusal to comply with the court order, many who pride themselves on having a vastly more compassionate moral foundation than Davis cheered the imprisonment of a political foe.

The ridicule of Davis became so pronounced that even smug circles, always on the precipice of self-reproach, began eventually to rein in the excess. Mocking her appearance, openly celebrating the incarceration of an ideological opponent ÃÂ these were not good looks.

But a more fundamental element of smug disdain for Kim Davis went unchallenged: the contention, at bottom, that Davis was not merely wrong in her convictions, but that her convictions were, in themselves, an error and a fraud.

That is: Kim Davis was not only on the wrong side of the law. She was not even a subscriber to a religious ideology that had found itself at moral odds with American culture. Rather, she was a subscriber to nothing, a hateful bigot who did not even understand her own religion.

Christianity, as many hastened to point out, is about love. Christ commands us to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. If the Bible took any position on the issue at all, it was that divorce, beloved by Davis, was a sin, and that she was a hypocrite masquerading among the faithful.

How many of these critiques were issued by atheists?

This, more than anything I can recall in recent American life, is an example of the smug style. Many liberals do not believe that evangelical Christianity ought to guide public life; many believe, moreover, that the moral conceits of that Christianity are wrong, even harmful to society. But to the smug liberal, it isn't that Kim Davis is wrong. How can she be? She's only mistaken. She just doesn't know the Good Facts, even about her own religion. She's angry and confused, another hick who's not with it.

It was an odd thing to assert in the case of Christianity, a religion that until recently was taken to be another shibboleth of the uncool, not a loving faith misunderstood by bigots. But this is knowing: knowing that the new line on Jesus is that the homophobes just don't get their own faith.

Kim Davis was behind the times. Her beliefs did not represent a legitimate challenge to liberal consensus because they did not represent a challenge at all: They were incoherent, at odds with the Good Facts. Google makes every man a theologian.

This, I think, is fundamental to understanding the smug style. If good politics and good beliefs are just Good Facts and good tweets ÃÂ that is, if there is no ideology beyond sensible conclusions drawn from a rational assessment of the world ÃÂ then there are no moral fights, only lying liars and the stupid rubes who believe them.

When Davis was first released from county jail, Mike Huckabee went to meet her. But the smug style sees no true ideology there, no moral threat to contend with. Only a huckster and a hick: one to be ridiculed, and the other to be refuted. What more, the smug man posts, could there be to say about it? They're idiots! Look, look: This Onion article nails it.

Popular story:

Adlai Stevenson, Democratic candidate for president, is on parade. A band is playing. Onlookers cheer. He waves to the crowd.

A woman shouts: ""Gov. Stevenson, you have the vote of every thinking person in this country!""

Stevenson replies: ""Thank you, ma'am, but we need a majority.""


The smug style says to itself, Yeah. I really am one of the few thinking people in this country, aren't I?

In November of last year, during the week when it became temporarily fashionable for American governors to declare that Syrian refugees would not be welcome in their state, Hamilton Nolan wrote an essay for Gawker called ""Dumb Hicks Are America's Greatest Threat.""

If there has ever been a tirade so dedicated to the smug style, to the proposition that it is neither malice, nor capital, nor ideological difference, but rather the backward stupidity of poor people that has ruined the state of American policy, then it is hidden beyond our view, in some uncool place, far from the front page of Gawker.

Why have weddings and houses gotten so ridiculously expensive? Blame inequality.

""Many of America's political leaders are warning of the dangers posed by Syrian refugees. They are underestimating, though, the much greater danger: dumbass hicks, in charge of things,"" Nolan wrote. ""...You, our elected officials, are embarrassing us. All of us, except your fellow dumb hicks, who voted for you in large numbers. You ÃÂ our racist, xenophobic, knuckle-dragging ignorant leaders ÃÂ are making us look bad in front of the guests (the whole world). You are the bad cousin in the family who always ruins Thanksgiving. Go in the back room and drink a can of beer alone please.""

Among the dumb hicks Nolan identifies are ""many Southern mayors"" and ""many lesser known state representatives."" He cites the Ku Klux Klan ÃÂ ""exclusively dumbass hicks,"" he writes. ""100%,"" he emphasizes ÃÂ despite the fact that the New York Times, in an investigation of white supremacist members of Stormfront.org, found that ""the top reported interest of Stormfront members is reading."" That they are ""news and political junkies."" Despite the fact that if ""you come compare Stormfront users to people who go to the Yahoo News site, it turns out that the Stormfront crowd is twice as likely to visit nytimes.com.""

""They have long threads praising Breaking Bad and discussing the comparative merits of online dating sites, like Plenty of Fish and OKCupid,"" the Times reports.

In another piece, published later the same month, Nolan wrote that ""Inequality of wealth ÃÂ or, if you like, the distribution of wealth in our society in a way that results in poverty ÃÂ is not just one issue among many. It is the root from which blooms nearly all major social problems.""

He's right about that. But who does he imagine is responsible for this inequality? The poor? The dumb? The hicks?

Hamilton Nolan isn't stupid. He has even, lately, argued that even the worst of the rubes must be allies in class struggle. Yet the trouble is still swallowing what ""motherfuckers"" those people are.

Nolan is perhaps the funniest and most articulate of those pointing fingers at the ""dumbass hicks,"" but he isn't alone. It is evidently intolerable to a huge swath of liberalism to confess the obvious: that those responsible have homes in Brooklyn, too. That they buy the same smartphones. That they too are on Twitter. That the oligarchs are making fun of stupid poor people too. That they're better at it, and always will be.

No: The trouble must be out there, somewhere. In the country. Where the idiots are; where the hicks are too stupid to know where problems blossom.

""To the dumb hick leaders of America, I say: (nothing). You wouldn't listen anyhow,"" Nolan writes. ""My words would go in one ear and right out the other. Like talking to an old block of wood.""

It's a shame. They might be receptive to his concerns about poverty.

If there is a single person who exemplifies the dumbass hick in the smug imagination, it is former President George W. Bush. He's got the accent. He can't talk right. He seems stupefied by simple concepts, and his politics are all gee-whiz Texas ignorance. He is the ur-hick. He is the enemy.

He got all the way to White House, and he's still being taken for a ride by the scheming rightwing oligarchs around him ÃÂ just like those poor rubes in Kansas. If only George knew Dick Cheney wasn't acting in his own best interests!

It is worth considering that Bush is the son of a president, a patrician born in Connecticut and educated at Andover and Harvard and Yale.

It is worth considering that he does not come from a family known for producing poor minds.


It is worth considering that beginning with his 1994 gubernatorial debate against Ann Richards, and at every juncture thereafter, opponents have been defeated after days of media outlets openly speculating whether George was up to the mental challenge of a one-on-one debate.

""Throughout his short political career,"" ABC's Katy Textor wrote on the eve of the 2000 debates against Al Gore, ""Bush has benefited from low expectations of his debating abilities. The fact that he skipped no less than three GOP primary debates, and the fact that he was reluctant to agree to the Commission on Presidential Debates proposal, has done little to contradict the impression of a candidate uncomfortable with this unavoidable fact of campaign life.""

""Done little to contradict.""

On November 6, 2000, during his final pre-election stump speech, Bush explained his history of political triumph thusly: ""They misunderesimated me.""

What an idiot. American liberals made fun of him for that one for years.

It is worth considering that he didn't misspeak.


He did, however, deliberately cultivate the confusion. He understood the smug style. He wagered that many liberals, eager to see their opponents as intellectually deficient, would buy into the act and thereby miss the more pernicious fact of his moral deficits.

He wagered correctly. Smug liberals said George was too stupid to get elected, too stupid to get reelected, too stupid to pass laws or appoint judges or weather a political fight. Liberals misunderestimated George W. Bush all eight years of his presidency.

George W. Bush is not a dumbass hick. In eight years, all the sick Daily Show burns in the world did not appreciably undermine his agenda.

The smug mind defends itself against these charges. Oh, we're just having fun, it says. We don't mean it. This is just for a laugh, it's just a joke, stop being so humorless.

It is exasperating, after all, to have to live in a country where so many people are so aggressively wrong about so much, they say. You go on about ideology and shibboleths and knowing, but we are right on the issues, aren't we? We are right on social policy and right on foreign policy and right on evolution, and same-sex marriage, and climate change too. Surely that's what matters.

We don't really mean they're all stupid ÃÂ but hey, lay off. We're not smug! This is just how we vent our frustration. Otherwise it would be too depressing having to share a country with these people!

We have long passed the point where blithe ridicule of the American right can be credibly cast as private stress relief and not, for instance, the animating public strategy of an entire wing of the liberal culture apparatus. The Daily Show, as it happens, is not the private entertainment of elites blowing off some steam. It is broadcast on national television.

Twitter isn't private. Not that anybody with the sickest burn to accompany the smartest chart would want it to be. Otherwise, how would everyone know how in-the-know you are?

The rubes have seen your videos. You posted it on their wall.

Still don't get why liberal opinion is correct? This video settles the debate for good.

I have been wondering for a long time how it is that so many entries to the op-ed pages take it as their justifying premise that they are arguing for a truth that has never been advanced before.

We have long passed the point where blithe ridicule of the American right can be credibly cast as private stress relief
""It's an accepted, nearly unchallenged assumption that Muslim communities across the U.S. have a problem ÃÂ that their youth tend toward violent ideology, or are susceptible to ""radicalization"" by groups like the Islamic State,"" began an editorial that appeared last December in the New York Times. But ""after all,"" it goes on, ""the majority of mass shootings in America are perpetrated by white men but no one questions what might have radicalized them in their communities.""

But this contention ÃÂ that Muslims possess superlative violent tendencies ÃÂ has been challenged countless times, hasn't it? It was challenged here, and here and here as far back as 9/11. The president of the United State challenged it on national television the night before this editorial was published. The Times itself did too. The myopic provincialism of anybody who believes that Muslims are a uniquely violent people is the basis of a five-year-old Onion headline, not some new moral challenge.

The smug style leaves its adherents no other option: If an idea has failed to take hold, if the Good Facts are not widely accepted, then the problem must be that these facts have not yet reached the disbelievers.


In December 2015, Public Policy Polling found that 30 percent of Republicans were in favor of bombing Agrabah, the Arab-sounding fictional city from Disney's Aladdin. Hilarious.

PPP has run joke questions before, of course: polling the popularity of Deez Nuts, or asking after God's job approval. But these questions, at least, let their audience in on the gag. Now liberalism is deliberately setting up the last segment of the population actually willing to endure a phone survey in service of what it knew would make for some hilarious copy when the rubes inevitably fell for it. This is not a survey in service of a joke ÃÂ it is a survey in service of a human punchline.

As if only Republicans covered up gaps in their knowledge by responding to what they assume is a good-faith question by guessing from their general principles.

It may be easy to mistake with the private venting of frustrated elites, but the rubes can read the New York Times, too. It is not where liberals whisper to each other about the secret things that go unchallenged. Poll respondents are not the secret fodder for a joke.

""Late-breaking sexism"": why younger women arenÃÂt excited about electing a woman president

This is the consequence of ""private"" venting, and it is the consequence of knowing too: If good politics comes solely from good data and good sense, it cannot be that large sections of the American public are merely wrong about so many vital things. It cannot be that they have heard our arguments but rejected them ÃÂ that might mean we must examine our own methods of persuasion.

No: it is only that the wrong beliefs are unchallenged ÃÂ that their believers are trapped in ""information bubbles"" and confirmation bias. That no one knows the truth, except the New York Times (or Vox). If only we could tell them, question them, show them this graph. If they don't get it then, well, then they're hopeless.

The smug style plays out in private too, of course. If you haven't started one yourself, you've surely seen the Facebook threads: Ten or 20 of Brooklyn's finest gather to say how exasperated they are, these days, by the stupidity of the American public.

""I just don't know what to do about these people,"" one posts. ""I think we have to accept that a lot of people are just misinformed!"" replies another. ""Like, I think they actually don't want to know anything that would undermine their worldview.""

They tend to do it in the comment section, under an article about how conservatives are difficult to persuade because they isolate themselves in mutually reinforcing information bubbles.

What have been the consequences of the smug style?

It has become a tradition for the smug, in editorials and essay and confident Facebook boasting, to assume that the presidential debates will feature their candidate, in command of the facts, wiping the floor with the empty huckster ignorance of their Republican opponent.

It was popularly assumed, for a time, that George W. Bush was too stupid to be elected president.

The smug believed the same of Ronald Reagan.


John Yoo, the architect of the Bush administration's torture policies, escaped The Daily Show unscathed. Liberals wondered what to do when Jon Stewart fails. What would success look like? Were police waiting in the wings, a one-way ticket to the Hague if Stewart nailed him?

It would be unfair to say that the smug style has never learned from these mistakes. But the lesson has been, We underestimated how many people could be fooled.

That is: We underestimated just how dumb these dumb hicks really are.

We just didn't get our message to them. They just stayed in their information bubble. We can't let the lying liars keep lying to these people ÃÂ but how do we reach these idiots who only trust Fox?


Rarely: Maybe they're savvier than we thought. Maybe they're angry for a reason.

As it happens, reasons aren't too difficult to come by.

During a San Francisco fundraiser in the 2008 primary campaign, Barack Obama offered an observation that was hailed not without some glee as the first unforced error from then-Senator Cool.

""You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania,"" Obama said, ""and, like, a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing's replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate, and they have not. And it's not surprising then they get bitter. They cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.""

It's the latter part that we remember eight years later ÃÂ the clinging to guns and religion and hate ÃÂ but it is the first part that was important: the part about lost jobs and neglect by two presidential administrations.

Obama's observation was not novel.

The notion that material loss and abandonment have driven America's white working class into a fit of resentment is boilerplate for even the Democratic Party's tepid left these days. But in the president's formulation and in the formulation of smug stylists who have embraced some material account of uncool attitudes, the downturn, the jobs lost and the opportunities narrowed, are a force of nature ÃÂ something that has ""been happening"" in the passive voice.

If the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence, it's, Why are they voting against their own self-interest?
This, I suspect, will one day become the Republican Party's rationale for addressing climate change: Look, we don't know how the dead hooker wound up in the hotel room. But she's here now, that's undeniable, so we've gotta get rid of the body.

Today, it is the excuse of American smug mind: Where did all of these poor people come from?

If pressed for an answer, I suppose they would say Republicans, elected by rubes voting against their own self-interest. Reagan, Gingrich, Bush ÃÂ all those Bad FactÃÂknowing halfwits who were too dumb to get elected to anything.

Well, sure. In the past 30 years of American life, the Republican Party has dedicated itself to replacing every labor law with a photo of Ronald Reagan's face.

But this does not excuse liberals beating full retreat to the colleges and the cities, abandoning the dispossessed to their fate. It does not excuse surrendering a century of labor politics in the name of electability. It does not excuse gazing out decades later to find that those left behind are not up on the latest thought and deciding, We didn't abandon them. The idiots didn't want to be saved.

It was not Ronald Reagan who declared the era of big government. It was not the GOP that decided the coastally based, culturally liberal industries of technology, Hollywood, and high finance were the future of the American economy.


If the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence, it's, Why are they voting against their own self-interest? But no party these past decades has effectively represented the interests of these dispossessed. Only one has made a point of openly disdaining them too.

Abandoned and without any party willing to champion their interests, people cling to candidates who, at the very least, are willing to represent their moral convictions. The smug style resents them for it, and they resent the smug in turn.


The rubes noticed that liberal Democrats, distressed by the notion that Indiana would allow bakeries to practice open discrimination against LGBTQ couples, threatened boycotts against the state, mobilizing the considerable economic power that comes with an alliance of New York and Hollywood and Silicon Valley to punish retrograde Gov. Mike Pence, but had no such passion when the same governor of the same state joined 21 others in refusing the Medicaid expansion. No doubt good liberals objected to that move too. But I've yet to see a boycott threat about it.

Early in the marriage equality fight, activists advanced the theory that when people discovered a friend or relative was gay, they became far more likely to support gay rights. They were correct. These days it is difficult for anybody in a position of liberal power ÃÂ whether in business, or government, or media ÃÂ to avoid having openly gay colleagues, colleagues whom they like and whom they'd like to help.

But few opinion makers fraternize with the impoverished. Few editors and legislators and Silicon Valley heroes have dinner with the lovely couple on food stamps down the road, much less those scraping by in Indiana.

If any single event provided the direct impetus for this essay, it was a running argument I had with an older, liberal writer over the seriousness of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Since June 2015, when Trump announced his candidacy, this writer has taken it upon himself each day to tell his Facebook followers that Donald Trump is a bad kind of dude.

That saying as much was the key to stopping him and his odious followers too.

""Ridicule is the most powerful weapon we have against any of our enemies,"" he told me in the end, ""but especially against the ones who, not incorrectly, take it so personally and lash out in ways that shine klieg lights on those very flaws we detest.

""If you're laughing at someone, you're certainly not respecting him.""

""Anyway,"" he went on, ""I'm done talking to you. We see the world differently. I'm fine with that. We don't need to be friends.""

Ridicule is the most effective political tactic.


Ridicule is especially effective when it's personal and about expressing open disdain for stupid, bad people.


Political legitimacy is granted by the respect of elite liberals.


You can't be legitimate if you're the butt of our jokes.


If you don't agree, we can't work together politically.


We can't even be friends, because politics is social.


Because politics is performative ÃÂ if we don't mock together, we aren't on the same side.


If there is a bingo card for the smug style somewhere, then cross off every square. You've won.

I would be less troubled if I did not believe that the smug style has captured an enormous section of American liberalism. If I believed that its politics, as practiced by its supporters, extended beyond this line of thought. If this were an exception.

But even as many have come around to the notion that Trump is the prohibitive favorite for his party's nomination, the smug interpretation has been predictable: We only underestimated how hateful, how stupid, the Republican base can be.

Trump capturing the nomination will not dispel the smug style; if anything, it will redouble it. Faced with the prospect of an election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the smug will reach a fever pitch: six straight months of a sure thing, an opportunity to mock and scoff and ask, How could anybody vote for this guy? until a morning in November when they ask, What the fuck happened?

On March 20, Salon's David Masciotra wrote that if Trump ""actually had the strength to articulate uncomfortable and inconvenient truths, he would turn his favorite word ÃÂ 'loser' ÃÂ ??not on full-time professionals in the press, but on his supporters.""

Masciotra goes on:

Journalists found that in the counties where Trump is most dominant, there are large numbers of white high school dropouts, and unemployed people no longer looking for work. An alliance with the incoherent personality cult of Donald Trump's candidacy correlates strongly with failure to obtain a high school diploma, and withdrawal from the labor force. The counties also have a consistent history of voting for segregationists, and have an above average percentage of its residents living in mobile homes.

The kicker: ""Many conservatives, and even some kindhearted liberals, might object to the conclusions one can draw from the data as stereotyping, but the empirical evidence leaves little choice. Donald Trump's supporters confirm the stereotype against them.""

Here's the conclusion I draw: If Donald Trump has a chance in November, it is because the knowing will dictate our strategy. Unable to countenance the real causes of their collapse, they will comfort with own impotence by shouting, ""Idiots!"" again and again, angrier and angrier, the handmaidens of their own destruction.

The smug style resists empathy for the unknowing. It denies the possibility of a politics whereby those who do not share knowing culture, who do not like the right things or know the Good Facts or recognize the intellectual bankruptcy of their own ideas can be worked with, in spite of these differences, toward a common goal.

It is this attitude that has driven the dispossessed into the arms of a candidate who shares their fury. It is this attitude that may deliver him the White House, a ""serious"" threat, a threat to be mocked and called out and hated, but not to be taken seriously. 

The wages of smug is Trump.

Nothing is more confounding to the smug style than the fact that the average Republican is better educated and has a higher IQ than the average Democrat. That for every overpowered study finding superior liberal open-mindedness and intellect and knowledge, there is one to suggest that Republicans have the better of these qualities.

Most damning, perhaps, to the fancy liberal self-conception: Republicans score higher in susceptibility to persuasion. They are willing to change their minds more often.

The Republican coalition tends toward the center: educated enough, smart enough, informed enough.

The Democratic coalition in the 21st century is bifurcated: It has the postgraduates, but it has the disenfranchised urban poor as well, a group better defined by race and immigration status than by class. There are more Americans without high school diplomas than in possession of doctoral degrees. The math proceeds from there.

The smug style takes this as a defense. Elite liberalism, and the Democratic Party by extension, cannot hate poor people, they say. We aren't smug! Just look at our coalition. These aren't rubes. Just look at our embrace of their issues.

But observe how quickly professed concern for the oppressed becomes another shibboleth for the smug, another kind of knowing. Mere awareness of these issues becomes the most important thing, the capacity to articulate them a new subset of Correct Facts.

Everyone in the know has read ""The Case for Reparations,"" but it was the reading and performed admiration that counted, praised in the same breath as, ""It is a better history than an actual case for actually paying, of course...""

Pretend for a moment that all of it is true. That the smug style apprehended the world as it really is, that knowing ÃÂ or knowing, no inflection ÃÂ did make our political divide. That the problem is the rubes. That the dumbass hicks are to blame. They can't help it: Their brains don't work. They isolate themselves from all the Good Facts, and they're being taken for a ride by con men.

Pretend the ridicule worked too: that the videos and the Twitter burns and destroying the opposition made all the bad guys go away.

What kind of world would it leave us? An endless cycle of jokes? Of sick burns and smart tweets and knowing? Relative to whom? The smug style demands an object of disdain; it would find a new one quickly.

It is central to the liberal self-conception that what separates them from reactionaries is a desire to help people, a desire to create a fairer and more just world. Liberals still want, or believe they still want, to make a more perfect union.

Whether you believe they are deluded or not, whether you believe this project is worthwhile in any form or not, what I am trying to tell you is that the smug style has fundamentally undermined even the aspiration, that it has made American liberalism into the worst version of itself.

It is impossible, in the long run, to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them. It becomes all at once too easy to decide you know best, to never hear, much less ignore, protest to the contrary.

At present, many of those most in need of the sort of help liberals believe they can provide despise liberalism, and are despised in turn. Is it surprising that with each decade, the ""help"" on offer drifts even further from the help these people need?

It is impossible, in the long run, to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them
Even if the two could be separated, would it be worth it? What kind of political movement is predicated on openly disdaining the very people it is advocating for?

The smug style, at bottom, is a failure of empathy. Further: It is a failure to believe that empathy has any value at all. It is the notion that anybody worthy of liberal time and attention and respect must capitulate, immediately, to the Good Facts.

If they don't (and they won't) you're free to write them off and mock them. When they suffer, it's their just desserts.

Make no mistake: I am not suggesting that liberals adopt a fuzzy, gentler version of their politics. I am not suggesting they compromise their issues for the sake of playing nice. What I am suggesting is that the battles waged by liberalism have drifted far away from their old egalitarian intentions.

I am suggesting that open disdain for the people they say they want to help has led them to stop helping those people, too.

I am suggesting that in the case of a Kim Davis, liberalism resist the impulse to go beyond the necessary legal fight and explicitly delight in punishing an old foe.

I am suggesting that they instead wonder what it might be like to have little left but one's values; to wake up one day to find your whole moral order destroyed; to look around and see the representatives of a new order call you a stupid, hypocritical hick without bothering, even, to wonder how your corner of your poor state found itself so alienated from them in the first place. To work with people who do not share their values or their tastes, who do not live where they live or like what they like or know their Good Facts or their jokes.

This is not a call for civility. Manners are not enough. The smug style did not arise by accident, and it cannot be abolished with a little self-reproach. So long as liberals cannot find common cause with the larger section of the American working class, they will search for reasons to justify that failure. They will resent them. They will find, over and over, how easy it is to justify abandoning them further.  They will choose the smug style.

Maybe the cycle is too deeply set already. Perhaps the divide, the disdain, the whole crack-up are inevitable. But if liberal good intentions are to make a play for a better future, they cannot merely recognize the ways they've come to hate their former allies. They must begin to mend the ways they lost them in the first place."	0
153	"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂThe United States government charged former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden with spying on Friday, apparently unaware that in doing so it had created a situation dripping with irony.

At a press conference to discuss the accusations, an N.S.A. spokesman surprised observers by announcing the spying charges against Mr. Snowden with a totally straight face.


ÃÂThese charges send a clear message,ÃÂ the spokesman said. ÃÂIn the United States, you canÃÂt spy on people.ÃÂ

Seemingly not kidding, the spokesman went on to discuss another charge against Mr. SnowdenÃÂthe theft of government documents: ÃÂThe American people have the right to assume that their private documents will remain private and wonÃÂt be collected by someone in the government for his own purposes.ÃÂ

ÃÂOnly by bringing Mr. Snowden to justice can we safeguard the most precious of American rights: privacy,ÃÂ added the spokesman, apparently serious."	0
154	"SAN ANTONIO (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂTexas Gov. Rick Perry announced yesterday that he would not seek reÃÂ«lection, telling supporters, ÃÂThe time has come to pass the mantle of leadership to a new generation of boneheads.ÃÂ

ÃÂIÃÂve had a good run,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂBut after twelve years, someone else who isnÃÂt playing with a full deck should take a turn at the wheel.ÃÂ


Reflecting on his twelve years as governor, Mr. Perry said that he had ÃÂno regretsÃÂ except for being incoherent the entire time.

Before leaving office, Gov. Perry said that he would propose three signature bills ÃÂjust to let future Texans know how Rick Perry marked his territory.ÃÂ

The first bill would require all voters in the state to have an I.D. with a photo of a white person; the second would force anyone filibustering an anti-abortion bill to ride a mechanical bull; and the third he could not remember."	0
155	"Median income would soar by more than $22,000. Nearly 26 million jobs would be created. The unemployment rate would fall to 3.8%.
Those are just a few of the things that would happen if Bernie Sanders became president and his ambitious economic program were put into effect, according to an analysis given exclusively to CNNMoney. The first comprehensive look at the impact of all of Sanders' spending and tax proposals on the economy was done by Gerald Friedman, a University of Massachusetts Amherst economics professor.
This more sweeping analysis was not commissioned by the candidate, though Sanders' policy director called it ""outstanding work."" Friedman has worked with Sanders in the past, but has never received any compensation. The Vermont senator asked Friedman to estimate the cost of Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan -- which came out to $13.8 trillion over 10 years -- and included the analysis when he unveiled his proposal last month.
Friedman, who believes in democratic socialism like the candidate, found that if Sanders became president -- and was able to push his plan through Congress -- median household income would be $82,200 by 2026, far higher than the $59,300 projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
In addition, poverty would plummet to a record low 6%, as opposed to the CBO's forecast of 13.9%. The U.S. economy would grow by 5.3% per year, instead of 2.1%, and the nation's $1.3 trillion deficit would turn into a large surplus by Sanders' second term.
Other economists, however, feel that Friedman's analysis is overly optimistic, saying it would be difficult to achieve that level of economic prosperity. Last week, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said Sanders' plan to pay for health care would fall short by at least $3 trillion.
Related: 5 unanswered questions about Bernie Sanders' health care plan
Sanders' plan to pour $14.5 trillion into the economy -- including spending on infrastructure and youth employment, increasing Social Security benefits, making college free and expanding health care and family leave -- would juice GDP and productivity. (Friedman reduces the cost of Medicare-for-all to $10.7 trillion because he estimates the government would save $3.1 trillion by eliminating tax breaks for health insurance premiums.)
Also, Sanders would raise the minimum wage, as well as shift income from the rich to the middle and working class through tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations.
""Like the New Deal of the 1930s, Senator Sanders' program is designed to do more than merely increase economic activity,"" Friedman writes. It will ""promote a more just prosperity, broadly-based with a narrowing of economy inequality.""
Many presidential hopefuls say their economic programs would boost growth. Donald Trump and Jeb Bush justify their big tax cuts by saying GDP would grow at a 4% rate. But their plans have been panned by experts as overly optimistic.
Friedman, however, argues that Sanders' plan would be more stimulative because it is pouring money into the economy, as opposed to cutting taxes. Several of Sanders' proposals -- such as spending $1 trillion on infrastructure -- will happen in the first few years of his administration.
The thinking goes: This enhanced government spending would increase demand on businesses, who would then hire more workers to meet their needs. The increase in employment will prompt people to buy more, leading other businesses to hire.
""If there is more spending, people will have more to do,"" Friedman said, noting that the share of the population with jobs could be restored to its 1999 level of more than 64%, up from its current 59.6% rate.
Related: Can Bernie Sanders deliver free college for all? Not so easily
Sanders' policy director, Warren Gunnels, also defended the estimates, noting the candidate is thinking big.
""We haven't had such an ambitious agenda to rebuild the middle class since Presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Johnson,"" he said.
 Sword swallowers and acrobats turn out for Bernie in Brooklyn

Still, some experts question whether the effects would be that large.
Stimulating demand can boost a weak economy during a recession, but ""it's harder to accept as a long-run growth strategy,"" said William Gale, the former director of Brookings' Economic Studies Program.
Also, it would be very difficult to achieve and maintain an economic growth rate of 5.3% per year after inflation. That target hasn't been hit consistently since the 1960s, when technology was providing big advancements, the workforce was younger and there was increased demand for American products worldwide as other countries fully recovered from World War II.
""The 5.3% number is a fantasy,"" said Jim Kessler, senior vice president at Third Way, a centrist think tank."	0
156	"The Electoral College formalized Donald Trump's election victory on Monday despite protests around the country to encourage GOP electors to abandon the Republican.

The president-elect easily racked up the 270 electoral votes needed to send him to the White House. Interest in the normally mundane voting process spiked this year as opposition to Trump continues to fester, fueled by Clinton's success in capturing over 2.6 million more votes than her Republican opponent.

""Today marks a historic electoral landslide victory in our nation's democracy,"" Trump said in a statement. ""I thank the American people for their overwhelming vote to elect me as their next President of the United States.""

He added, ""this election represents a movement that millions of hard working men and women all across the country stood behind and made possible. With this historic step we can look forward to the bright future ahead. I will work hard to unite our country and be the President of all Americans.""

Anti-Trump protesters descended on state capitols throughout the U.S. in a last-ditch effort to persuade so-called ""faithless electors"" in states Trump won to change their vote. Many of the Republicans casting ballots said they were inundated with calls and emails urging them to dump Trump.

And some electors did break with how their state voted, albeit in unexpected ways. In Washington, a state Clinton won by 16 points, the former secretary of state received just eight of the state's 12 electoral votes. Colin Powell received three votes and Native American tribal leader Faith Spotted Eagle received one as part of an effort to promote a candidate other than Trump.

An elector in both Maine and Minnesota attempted to cast a ballot for Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully challenged Clinton in the Democratic primary. However state laws requiring electors to follow the statewide vote invalidated both efforts.

Only one Republican elector, Christopher Suprun of Texas, publically pledged not to vote for Trump despite his state heavily favoring the president-elect last month. One other Texas elector also abandoned Trump in the final vote.

An Associated Press survey of the electoral college's 538 members found there was little interest from members in breaking from voting how their states did. Thirty-seven electors would have needed to defect from Trump to endanger him from winning.

157	"atican City ÃÂ In a final speech to the synod, Pope Francis endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States, while taking some clear swipes at conservatives who hold up church doctrine above all else, and use it to cast judgment on others.

ÃÂThe synod experience also made us better realize that the true defenders are not those who uphold its letter, but its spirit; not ideas but people; not formulas but free availability of GodÃÂs love and forgiveness,ÃÂ Pope Francis said. ÃÂI see in Senator Bernard Sanders a man of great integrity and moral conviction, who understands these principles and genuinely wants whatÃÂs best for all people

The pope went on to criticize ultra-conservatives, saying church leaders should confront difficult issues ÃÂfearlessly, without burying our heads in the sand.ÃÂ It was the latest in a series of admonitions to bishops by the pontiff, who has stressed since his election in 2013 that the 1.2 billion-member Church should be open to change, side with the poor, and rid itself of the arrogance and unfettered narcissism that has alienated so many Catholics in recent years.

Naturally, conservative Catholics are not happy with Francis for being so outspoken on social issues and American politics. ÃÂThe pope needs to stick to religion, and stay the hell out of politics,ÃÂ says Cardinal Justin Francis Rigali. ÃÂConservative Catholics are losing faith in the Church, and this falls directly on the shoulders of Pope Francis with his socialist ideology and warped political views.ÃÂ

Conservative news outlets like Fox News have taken issue with Pope Francis on everything from climate change to income inequality. Bill OÃÂReilly has numerous times compared Pope Francis to Bernie Sanders, accusing both of being ÃÂfalse prophets.ÃÂ

Liberals and progressives on the other hand applaud the pope for bringing social and environmental issues to the forefront of the Catholic Church. ÃÂHeÃÂs a Catholic rockstar,ÃÂ says Prudence Bradley, 19, from upstate New York. ÃÂPope Francis has made it cool to be a Christian again.ÃÂ"	1

159	"ÃÂm cool with you removing me from your friends list if you donÃÂt like this post. You can even disown me if you like. But Donald Trump isnÃÂt a good person, nor would he be a good president. I can understand a difference in politics. I can understand if you donÃÂt like a government run by Democrats. I can understand if you donÃÂt like certain ideologies, like Socialism. But I canÃÂt understand why you would support someone as hateful, sexist, racist and ignorant as Donald Trump.

How do you support him so blindly? Ask yourself, are you a racist, sexist, hateful and ignorant person as well? I hear his supporters saying they like him because he tells the truth, because heÃÂs so rich he can say whatever he feels like with no apologies. Just because Trump is saying these things doesnÃÂt suddenly make them right. ItÃÂs not okay to discriminate against an entire religion based on a small percentage of its followers who have become terrorists by twisting the words of the religion to fit their crazy ideals. ItÃÂs not okay to marginalize an entire race of people, saying things like all the Mexicans are lazy, that they are all stealing our jobs and bringing drugs into our country.

White people also have bad apples. So does every race of people. WeÃÂre all human. Some humans are really bad people. Some are really good. And it doesnÃÂt matter what color they are, it makes no difference whatsoever. Trump says he is just telling the truth. But whose truth? There are lazy people in every race and there are dangerous violent people in every race and every religion. Kicking all Muslims out of the country is not the answer, nor is it the acceptable behavior of a person in an extremely powerful position, like the President of the United States.

The Japanese Internment camps were wrong, Segregation was wrong, Slavery was wrong. We fought wars amongst ourselves to rise above racism and hatred. In WWII more than 60 million people died worldwide. Why? Because of twisted people who were whipping up the population into a frenzy and making ridiculous statements, killing innocent people simply because of their race or religion. The United States lost more than 400,000 lives fighting in that war, against the same ideas that Trump is pushing. The idea that certain religions are more dangerous than others and the idea that people should be judged based on the color of their skin rather than the content of their character.

ÃÂThey always say itÃÂs so important to make your voice heard, to get out and vote. But IÃÂm not sure if itÃÂs ever been more important than now.ÃÂ
WeÃÂre still healing from the damage inflicted by the Civil War, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Iraq and the War on Terror. And it isnÃÂt just ISIS or Al-Qaeda. ItÃÂs our own people in this country killing their fellow countrymen over differences of opinion, like whether or not you believe abortion is okay or what kind of political ideology you support. And then there are just the plainly insane people who finally snap and go on shooting rampages for no discernible reason at all. They just went mad.

The kind of leadership Trump is displaying is irresponsible and dangerous. His virulent ideas are seeping into the brains of his supporters. Supporters who think itÃÂs okay to say things like ÃÂlight the mother@!$%#er on fireÃÂ while a protester is being dragged out of one of his rallies. Maybe the protester was wrong to be where he was at the time, but no matter what he did, there was no reason to set him on fire. In fact, there is NEVER a reason to set anyone on fire. Unless itÃÂs because they are dead and they wish to be cremated.

TrumpÃÂs supporters are angry, and anger is infectious. I can tell you as a non-supporter of Trump I am just as angry. We need the kind of leader that seeks to bring us together, not tear us apart. Why do we have to fight against helping each other, against common sense, against a united Nation? The American Dream is a nightmare and we are feeding it, making it worse every day. Trump is a bully, a loud mouth, ignorant, sexist, racist, disgusting example of how horrible humans can potentially be.

He is the crazy person at your dinner table who wonÃÂt stop running his mouth. The only reason he is allowed to carry on with his ugly hateful rhetoric is because you have too much respect for Grandma to get into a fist fight in her home. HeÃÂs the guy you have to endure until he leaves, all the while hating every minute that you have to occupy the same space. Lucky for us, this isnÃÂt GrandmaÃÂs house, so feel free to punch him in the mouth in the form of getting out and making your vote count.

They always say itÃÂs so important to make your voice heard, to get out and vote. But IÃÂm not sure if itÃÂs ever been more important than now. Differences of political ideals are one thing, I can agree to disagree on many matters across a wide array of topics, but racism isnÃÂt one of them, neither is hate, neither is the belittling of women or the judgment of others based on their appearance or their disability, or their sexual preference.

By supporting Trump do you think things will go back to the way they were? Back when gay people had to hide in fear, back when people of any other color than white had to worry about getting lynched, back when it was okay to openly hate? Do you think empowered women will suddenly quit their jobs and go back to the kitchen ? Because electing Trump wonÃÂt make any of that come true. WeÃÂre past that as a nation, or at least I thought we were.

ÃÂI can agree to disagree on many matters across a wide array of topics, but racism isnÃÂt one of them, neither is hate, neither is the belittling of women...ÃÂ
If youÃÂre not a racist, bigoted, misogynistic jerk, then voting for Trump simply because you donÃÂt like Democrats is wrong. If you are one of his supporters and youÃÂre just a racist and you donÃÂt care who knows it then vote for him, but know that the good people of America will not stand for it and he will never win a fair election. And please consider pursuing an education and work on your empathy toward your fellow human beings. Whatever led you to believe that racism is okay can be unlearned if you open your mind. IÃÂm sorry that you were raised to believe that you deserve better treatment than the rest of the people on the planet that have different views than yours, worship different gods than you and have skin that isnÃÂt white.

To all the people, of all the races and religions that Donald Trump stands against, to all the women that donÃÂt meet his standards of beauty, to all the good Muslims, and Christians, Mormons and Catholics and Jewish, Italians, Irish and Asians, to the African-Americans and Native Americans, to anyone who has ever been persecuted, belittled, made to feel inferior or bullied based on ignorance like the kind that Trump is spewing, please, I implore you to get out and vote against him. DonÃÂt let the progress of this great nation be halted. WeÃÂve come too far.

In this country we FIGHT and DIE for freedom, for Truth and Justice. We fight for whatÃÂs right. And what Trump is doing and saying isnÃÂt right. Some have attributed the following statement to Abraham Lincoln*:

ÃÂI see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and cause me to tremble for safety of my country; corporations have been enthroned, an era of corruption in High Places will follow, and the Money Power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the People, until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands, and the Republic destroyed.ÃÂ

And he couldnÃÂt be more right. Trump IS the one percent, he IS working on your prejudices, and he WILL destroy the Republic if he is elected, make no doubt about it.

If you donÃÂt believe me, just look at the level of crazy coming out of his own mouth:

ÃÂ[I am] calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countryÃÂs representatives can figure out what is going onÃÂ ÃÂ Donald Trump. ThatÃÂs religious discrimination.

I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.ÃÂ - Donald Trump. The words of an arrogant hate monger.

ÃÂWhen Mexico sends its people, theyÃÂre not sending the best. TheyÃÂre not sending you, theyÃÂre sending people that have lots of problems and theyÃÂre bringing those problems with us. TheyÃÂre bringing drugs. TheyÃÂre bringing crime. TheyÃÂre rapists... And some, I assume, are good people.ÃÂ ÃÂ Donald Trump. Racist.

ÃÂOur great African-American President hasnÃÂt exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore.ÃÂ ÃÂ Donald Trump. Racist.

ÃÂI think the only difference between me and the other candidates is that IÃÂm more honest and my women are beautiful.ÃÂ - Donald Trump. Sexist. As if women are possessions rather than people. And also a lie. A lie about how honest he is.

How can you support this man?

160	"CEDAR PLAINS, PAÃÂAfter years of delays and mounting criticism from voters and political pundits, President Barack Obama finally followed through on a campaign promise he made in 2008 to spend one night alone in the abandoned Cedar Plains Family Fun amusement park, sources confirmed Wednesday.

At approximately 6 p.m. last night, members of the press reportedly looked on as ObamaÃÂcarrying only a flashlight, a water bottle, and a backpack full of snacksÃÂscaled the 9-foot-high chain-link fence and entered the derelict theme park, making good on a vow that had been a central component of his initial run for the White House.

ÃÂEight years ago, I made an oath that if I were elected president, I would spend dusk till dawn in this old, run-down amusement park, and tonight I am fulfilling my obligation to the American people,ÃÂ said Obama, who had been widely accused of favoring other legislative priorities above an overnight stay inside the dilapidated regional attraction that shut its doors in 2003. ÃÂBetween now and sunrise, I will climb to the top of the Ripsaw roller coaster, I will throw a rock through the window of the snow cone stand, and just as IÃÂve said time and time again, I will wander around in the big concrete track where the Lazy River used to be.ÃÂ

ÃÂAnd to prove that I do not take your support for granted, I will also walk through the Hall of Mirrors at midnight,ÃÂ Obama added.

Since first raising the issue during the 2008 primaries, ObamaÃÂs promise to spend at least 12 hours unaccompanied within the overgrown park grounds has been a focal point of his domestic policy. Throughout the general election, his repeated vows to climb down into the basin under the GopherÃÂs Gulch log flume and spend 10 minutes inside one of the rusted cars on the Ferris wheel became fixtures of his stump speeches and TV ads, characterizing the young Illinois senator as the only candidate willing to brave the eerily barren park in the dead of night.

However, with the pledge still unfulfilled after ObamaÃÂs first 100 days in office, activists began protesting outside the White House regularly, demanding to know when the president would finally put on a thick coat, walk across the propertyÃÂs cracked parking lot to the padlocked gates, and implement his much-discussed plan to stroll down Cedar PlainsÃÂ debris-strewn midway under the light of a full moon.

ÃÂAt a time of great strife when Americans were looking for something to rally around, Obama united the country by swearing that one of his top goals would be to crawl under the wooden barricades and investigate the parkÃÂs old food court,ÃÂ said political analyst Mark Halperin, noting that Obama built momentum around his candidacy and attracted sizable political donations whenever he mentioned the possibility of finding old funnel cake and cotton candy machines that had gone unused for years. ÃÂSo perhaps it was inevitable that there would be backlash when ObamaÃÂs first two years elapsed without him providing even a basic outline of how he would break into the amusement park or a list of which of the decrepit rides he would see if he could turn back on.ÃÂ

ÃÂFrankly, he got lucky when the bin Laden raid took everyoneÃÂs attention away, or else he may not have been reelected,ÃÂ Halperin added.

In an effort to help secure his presidential legacy, Obama returned to his campaign pledge earlier this year, announcing to the nation during his State of the Union address that he had purchased a sleeping bag in anticipation of spending a night in the park, and later telling graduates in a speech at Howard University that before he left office, he would do everything in his power to take a picture from inside the Gravitron to show people what it looked like in there now.

ÃÂI was really impressed with Obama when he was first running because he seemed like the only candidate who actually had the will and the temperament to spend the whole night in a spooky boarded-up amusement park,ÃÂ said Kansas City, MO resident Angie Hartney, noting that the then-senatorÃÂs claim was one of the primary reasons she supported him in 2008. ÃÂI still think he shouldÃÂve done this back in his first term, but after all the compromises and excusesÃÂand it seeming like heÃÂd never actually go down into the underground storage rooms where they supposedly keep some of the old bumper carsÃÂitÃÂs great to know he still has the power to inspire people.ÃÂ

ÃÂThatÃÂs the Obama I voted for,ÃÂ added Hartney.

At press time, the presidentÃÂs approval rating had risen to an all-time high as an exhausted but triumphant Obama emerged from the park holding a tattered stuffed animal from the shuttered ring toss stand."	0
161	"MADISON, WISCONSIN (The Borowitz Report) ÃÂ Serving notice that he intends to go toe-to-toe with the controversial real-estate mogul, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker used the official announcement of his Presidential candidacy to assure Republican voters that he is as horrible as Donald Trump.

ÃÂDonald Trump has grabbed a lot of headlines over the past few weeks by spewing bigotry and venom,ÃÂ Walker told an enthusiastic crowd of supporters. ÃÂI want to make it clear that when it comes to those things, I take a back seat to no one.ÃÂ

Concluding his speech with a line that triggered a standing ovation, Walker said, ÃÂTo those who thought Donald Trump was the only sociopath in the race, let me say this: not anymore.ÃÂ

Prior to his announcement, aides to the Wisconsin governor had privately fretted that by establishing his identity as an arrogant and ill-informed merchant of hatred, Trump had appropriated WalkerÃÂs brand.

In the hopes of proving that Trump has no monopoly on odiousness, aides have released a point-by-point comparison showing that on such key issues as workerÃÂs rights and health care, Walker is just as terrifying as the former reality-show host.

Acknowledging that Trump has dominated media attention for now, WalkerÃÂs aides believe that the governor will eventually reclaim his rightful mantle as the worst person in the race.

ÃÂSooner or later, the Trump candidacy is going to fall apart and voters are going to be looking for another dick to vote for,ÃÂ one aide said. ÃÂScott Walker wants to be that dick.ÃÂ"	0
162	"We live in a big, diverse society. There are essentially two ways to maintain order and get things done in such a society ÃÂ politics or some form of dictatorship. Either through compromise or brute force. Our founding fathers chose politics.

Politics is an activity in which you recognize the simultaneous existence of different groups, interests and opinions. You try to find some way to balance or reconcile or compromise those interests, or at least a majority of them. You follow a set of rules, enshrined in a constitution or in custom, to help you reach these compromises in a way everybody considers legitimate.

The downside of politics is that people never really get everything they want. ItÃÂs messy, limited and no issue is ever really settled. Politics is a muddled activity in which people have to recognize restraints and settle for less than they want. Disappointment is normal.

But thatÃÂs sort of the beauty of politics, too. It involves an endless conversation in which we learn about other people and see things from their vantage point and try to balance their needs against our own. Plus, itÃÂs better than the alternative: rule by some authoritarian tyrant who tries to govern by clobbering everyone in his way.

As Bernard Crick wrote in his book, ÃÂIn Defence of Politics,ÃÂ ÃÂPolitics is a way of ruling divided societies without undue violence.ÃÂ

Over the past generation we have seen the rise of a group of people who are against politics. These groups ÃÂ best exemplified by the Tea Party but not exclusive to the right ÃÂ want to elect people who have no political experience. They want ÃÂoutsiders.ÃÂ They delegitimize compromise and deal-making. TheyÃÂre willing to trample the customs and rules that give legitimacy to legislative decision-making if it helps them gain power.

Ultimately, they donÃÂt recognize other people. They suffer from a form of political narcissism, in which they donÃÂt accept the legitimacy of other interests and opinions. They donÃÂt recognize restraints. They want total victories for themselves and their doctrine.

This antipolitics tendency has had a wretched effect on our democracy. It has led to a series of overlapping downward spirals:

The antipolitics people elect legislators who have no political skills or experience. That incompetence leads to dysfunctional government, which leads to more disgust with government, which leads to a demand for even more outsiders.

The antipolitics people donÃÂt accept that politics is a limited activity. They make soaring promises and raise ridiculous expectations. When those expectations are not met, voters grow cynical and, disgusted, turn even further in the direction of antipolitics.

The antipolitics people refuse compromise and so block the legislative process. The absence of accomplishment destroys public trust. The decline in trust makes deal-making harder.

WeÃÂre now at a point where the Senate says it wonÃÂt even hold hearings on a presidential Supreme Court nominee, in clear defiance of custom and the Constitution. WeÃÂre now at a point in which politicians live in fear if they try to compromise and legislate. WeÃÂre now at a point in which normal political conversation has broken down. People feel unheard, which makes them shout even louder, which further destroys conversation.

And in walks Donald Trump. People say that Trump is an unconventional candidate and that he represents a break from politics as usual. ThatÃÂs not true. Trump is the culmination of the trends we have been seeing for the last 30 years: the desire for outsiders; the bashing style of rhetoric that makes conversation impossible; the decline of coherent political parties; the declining importance of policy; the tendency to fight cultural battles and identity wars through political means.

Trump represents the path the founders rejected. There is a hint of violence undergirding his campaign. There is always a whiff, and sometimes more than a whiff, of ÃÂIÃÂd like to punch him in the face.ÃÂ

I printed out a Times list of the insults Trump has hurled on Twitter. The list took up 33 pages. TrumpÃÂs style is bashing and pummeling. Everyone who opposes or disagrees with him is an idiot, a moron or a loser. The implied promise of his campaign is that he will come to Washington and bully his way through.

TrumpÃÂs supporters arenÃÂt looking for a political process to address their needs. They are looking for a superhero. As the political scientist Matthew MacWilliams found, the one trait that best predicts whether youÃÂre a Trump supporter is how high you score on tests that measure authoritarianism.

This isnÃÂt just an American phenomenon. Politics is in retreat and authoritarianism is on the rise worldwide. The answer to Trump is politics. ItÃÂs acknowledging other people exist. ItÃÂs taking pleasure in that difference and hammering out workable arrangements. As Harold Laski put it, ÃÂWe shall make the basis of our state consent to disagreement. Therein shall we ensure its deepest harmony.ÃÂ"	0
163	"Two Senate Republicans joined demands for a bipartisan probe into RussiaÃÂs suspected election interference allegedly designed to bolster Donald Trump as questions continue to mount about the president-electÃÂs expected decision to nominate a secretary of state candidate with close ties to Russia.

Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) ÃÂ the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee ÃÂ joined calls by incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Armed Services ranking Democrat Jack Reed (R.I.) for a thorough, bipartisan investigation of Russian influence in the U.S. elections. Their statement came two days after The Washington Post reported the CIAÃÂs private conclusion that RussiaÃÂs activities were intended to tip the scales to help Trump.

ÃÂRecent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,ÃÂ the four senators said in a statement on Sunday morning. ÃÂDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks.ÃÂ

ÃÂThis cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country. We are committed to working in this bipartisan manner, and we will seek to unify our colleagues around the goal of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security,ÃÂ they added.

 
Republican senators John McCain (Arizona) and Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) have been highly have been highly critical of Donald TrumpÃÂs comments about Russia. (Michael Reynolds/EPA)

But McCain and Graham ÃÂ who frequently criticized Trump before and after his election ÃÂ have often bucked Republican leaders, and their embrace of a wide-ranging Russia probe does not necessarily signal support from other Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), one of the more moderate Republicans in the upper chamber, suggested a bipartisan investigation may be ÃÂuseful toward achieving an objective accounting of any alleged meddling by foreign adversaries.ÃÂ

ÃÂThe purpose of any investigation, whether by the Obama administration or Congress, is not to question or relitigate the results of any past or present Presidential election,ÃÂ she said in a statement. ÃÂInstead, any review must focus on the long overdue task of improving the defenses of the United States against cyber attacks, including those that might seek to affect or influence political campaign.ÃÂ

Another GOP senator ÃÂ Sen. James Lankford (Okla.), who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee ÃÂ agreed with McCain and GrahamÃÂs decision to support a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber intrusion by Russia in the U.S. elections.

ÃÂCybersecurity investigation of Russian interference canÃÂt be partisan,ÃÂ Lankford tweeted Sunday.

Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence CommitteeÃÂs chairman, Richard Burr (R-N.C.), said Sunday that the panel ÃÂwill continue to conduct vigorous oversight of all intelligence matters.ÃÂ

But he made no specific mention of Russia, unlike Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said cyber threats by AmericaÃÂs ÃÂrivals,ÃÂ including Russia, pose ÃÂserious challengesÃÂ that should not be ÃÂpoliticized or viewed through a partisan lens.ÃÂ

Johnson said as chairman Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations panel he would ÃÂcontinue to hold hearings based on fact ÃÂ not innuendo ÃÂ for the sole purpose of informing effective policy and appropriate countermeasures.ÃÂ

Republicans may be loath to join calls for such a wide-ranging investigation into RussiaÃÂs election-related activities given that Trump has dismissed the CIA claims as ÃÂridiculous.ÃÂ They may worry about picking an obvious fight with the president-elect before he is even inaugurated. Trump has signaled he wants a warmer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he praised during the campaign.

ÃÂI think itÃÂs just another excuse. I donÃÂt believe it .?.?. No, I donÃÂt believe it at all,ÃÂ Trump said of the CIA charges on ÃÂFox News Sunday.ÃÂ Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway echoed her boss on CBSÃÂs ÃÂFace the Nation,ÃÂ saying that such allegations from the intelligence community were ÃÂlaughable and ridiculous.ÃÂ

Trump also played down the importance of receiving the daily intelligence briefing, a tradition for presidents and presidents-elect. He has received the briefings only sporadically since winning the election.

A U.S. intelligence official said it is ÃÂconcerningÃÂ that intelligence on Russia relating to the election is ÃÂbeing dismissed out of hand as false or politically partisan.ÃÂ

ÃÂThe inclination to ignore such intelligence and impugn the integrity of U.S. intelligence officials is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country,ÃÂ said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

[Trump denies CIA report that Russia intervened to help him win election]

McConnell himself has been notably silent since the Post report was published on Friday night, and his number-two, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), downplayed the significance of it in a series of tweets ÃÂ although some of them suggested CongressÃÂs review of Russian actions should broaden.

ÃÂAll this ÃÂnewsÃÂ of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years. Serious, but hardly news,ÃÂ Cornyn tweeted Saturday.

The Texas Republican seemed to support, however, a wider look at Russia as a global actor rather than one confined to its role in the U.S. election, retweeting the below tweet from Graham: ÃÂCyber-attacks, undermining NATO, Ukraine, butchery in Syria, etc. I intend to look at all things Russia ÃÂ not just election influence.ÃÂ

Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), in his first substantial comment on Russian hacking since the report Friday, said Sunday he ÃÂrejects any politicization of intelligence matters,ÃÂ calling foreign intervention ÃÂunacceptable.ÃÂ

For the most part, other key Republicans were silent on the issue of whether to embrace a bipartisan look at whether  PutinÃÂs government was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee emails and their publication by WikiLeaks in an alleged bid to help Trump and damage Hillary ClintonÃÂs campaign.

At the same time, several Republican senators raised concerns about TrumpÃÂs likely nomination of Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobilÃÂs chief executive, as secretary of state due to his  ties to Putin. Republicans in a 52-to-48 Senate have only the slimmest of margins to get him confirmed, should Democrats decide to uniformly oppose the nomination. Only three Republicans would need to side with Democrats in order to defeat Tillerson.

The potential nomination sparked a backlash among the partyÃÂs traditional hawks who oppose Putin, and some senior strategists feared that more than a handful of Republicans would outright oppose his nomination ÃÂ requiring Trump to find Democratic support in order to confirm his potential Secretary of State.

ÃÂItÃÂs a matter of concern to me that he has such a close relationship with Vladimir Putin, that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat,ÃÂ McCain told CBSÃÂs Face the Nation.

ÃÂBeing a ÃÂfriend of VladimirÃÂ is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary of State,ÃÂ Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted Sunday.

Republicans outnumber Democrats by only one vote on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must approve a secretary of state nominee before the full Senate votes. Over the weekend, several committee Democrats, including Sens. Robert Menendez (N.J.) and Christopher A. Coons (Del.), stated their deep skepticism of Tillerson as a candidate.

In a post on Facebook, Menendez called the idea Tillerson could be named secretary of state ÃÂalarming and absurd,ÃÂ concluding that ÃÂthe Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the PresidentÃÂs Cabinet guiding our nationÃÂs foreign policy.ÃÂ

Yet the committeeÃÂs chairman, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) ÃÂ who was considered a possible pick for TrumpÃÂs secretary of state ÃÂ has said Tillerson would be a good choice.

ÃÂIf it is Rex Tillerson, he is a very good individual,ÃÂ Corker tweeted.

Should Tillerson make it to a floor vote, Democrats could not block the nomination alone. If Democrats stick together, Republicans must muster at least 50 of the 52 votes they will have to successfully confirm him, as Vice President-elect Mike Pence could cast the tiebreaking vote.

Graham has already also strongly hinted that he might oppose the nomination.

ÃÂI donÃÂt know the man much at all, but letÃÂs put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, order of friendship, then weÃÂre gonna have some talkinÃÂ,ÃÂ Graham said early Saturday morning. ÃÂWeÃÂll have some questions. I donÃÂt want to prejudge the guy but thatÃÂs a bit unnerving.ÃÂ"	0
164	"It has been more than fifteen years since Rage Against The Machine have released new music. The members of the band have involved themselves in various other projects during their lengthy hiatus, but one pressing issue has forced the band to team up once again.

In a statement posted online, Rage Against The Machine announced they would be releasing a brand new album aimed at spreading awareness about ÃÂhow awful Donald Trump isÃÂ.

ÃÂWe must pick up the microphone, the guitar, the bass, and the drums to tell the world how bad Donald Trump is. We have stayed silent for many years, but enough is enough.The bulls are on parade.ÃÂ the statement said.
The band plans to perform outside of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio on July 18th. This isnÃÂt the first time Rage Against The Machine showed up outside of a political convention. The group played to a massive crowd outside of the 2000 DNC.

Their music video for ÃÂSleep Now In The FireÃÂ famously predicted a Trump presidential run.

You will be able to pre-order the album starting April 1st. The album is tentatively named ÃÂRage Against The DonaldÃÂ and a release date has not yet been revealed.

Here is the official track listing:

Sleep Now Trump YouÃÂre Fired
TrumpÃÂs Bullshit On Parade
There Aint No Spray-Tan Here
Trumpify
Renegades Of Trump
Lights Out, Trump Is A Racist, Yo!
Trump was reportedly furious about the album, telling the media and others not to spread the word about their ÃÂdisgusting musicÃÂ. Clearly, he doesnÃÂt want anyone to know about this album.

Rage Against The Machine is back! ÃÂWhat better place than here? What better time than now?ÃÂ"	1
165	"Istanbul| Ottomans were the first to walk on the surface of the moon, not Neil Armstrong, said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, yesterday, during an iftar (fast-breaking) dinner hosted by the Turkish Green Crescent.

Mr. Erdogan claimed that Muslim explorers reached the Moon more than 300 years before the beginning of the Appolo program, vowing to build a mosque ÃÂin the craterÃÂ where they landed.

ÃÂIt is alleged that the first man to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong in 1969,ÃÂ Erdogan said. ÃÂIn fact, Muslim space explorers reached our satellite 334 years before that, in 1635. Everyone knows the story of the famous aviator, LagÃÂ¢ri Hasan ÃÂelebi, the ÃÂOttoman Rocket ManÃÂ, who made the first successful manned rocket flight in 1633. What you might not know, is that he attempted to reach the moon, two years later, and could very well have succeeded!ÃÂ

The story of Lagari Hasan ÃÂelebi was purported by a famous 17th century Arab merchant and traveller, Mehmed Zilli, also known as Evliya ÃÂelebi. In his famous travelog, he explains that Lagari Hasan ÃÂelebi launched in a 7-winged rocket using 50 okka (63.5 kg or 140 lbs) of gunpowder. It took off from Sarayburnu, a site below the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul.

As Evliya Celebi wrote, Lagari proclaimed before launch ÃÂO my sultan! Be blessed, I am going to talk to Jesus!ÃÂ, before lighting the rocketÃÂs gunpowder.  He then ascended more than 200 meters in the air and landed in the sea, hundreds of meters from his takeoff point. Swimming ashore, he allegedly reported: ÃÂO my sultan! Jesus sends his regards to you!ÃÂ.

This 17th-century engraving depicts one of LagÃÂ¢ri Hasan ÃÂelebiÃÂs famous rocket flights, but itÃÂs unclear if it represents his first flight or his attempt to reach the moon, in 1635.
President ErdoganÃÂs surprising claim generated some whispers and laughter from the audience, a reaction that clearly angered the Turkish politician. He slammed the skeptics for mocking his claims, adding that he would soon have the proofs to back his claims.

ÃÂWhy do you not believe it? Because youÃÂve never believed that a Muslim can do such a thing, just like youÃÂve never believed that our ancestors could manage to launch ships in the Golden Horn after transporting them across land,ÃÂ Erdogan said, referring to Ottoman Sultan Mehmet IIÃÂs conquest of Istanbul in 1453. ÃÂThis claim is not new. A number of academics in Turkey and in the rest of the world have made this claim, and I believe they are right. NASA may have destroyed most of the physical evidence of the OttomanÃÂs success during the Apollo 11 mission, but weÃÂll try to find any evidence that might have escaped the cover up.ÃÂ

The Turkish President did not, however, give any precision about the proofs he was expecting to find nor how he was hoping to gather them.

The description of the flying engine used by LagÃÂ¢ri Hasan ÃÂelebi is pretty vague and doesnÃÂt really allow modern scientists to accurately recreate the design. This sketch shows the basic design as it is described, but is almost certainly incomplete or partially inaccurate.
The story of LagÃÂ¢ri Hasan ÃÂelebi is considered a legend by most historians, and most experts believe that it is impossible that the ÃÂaviatorÃÂ could have survived a flight into outer space.

His first flight was, indeed, addressed in an experiment by the television show MythBusters, on November 11, 2009, in the episode ÃÂCrash and BurnÃÂ.  The rocket constructed for the TV show did not adhere closely, however, to Evliya ÃÂelebiÃÂs descriptions and the final design did not attempt to utilize materials of the period;

The team noted that Evliya ÃÂelebi had not sufficiently specified the alleged design used by LagÃÂ¢ri Hasan, but concluded that it would have been ÃÂextremely difficultÃÂ for a 17th-century figure, without access to modern steel alloys and welding techniques, to land safely or even achieve thrust at all. This conclusion was backed by the fact that, although the re-imagined rocket rose, it exploded in midflight"	1
166	"In the heat of a presidential campaign, youÃÂd think that a story about one partyÃÂs nominee giving a large contribution to a state attorney general who promptly shut down an inquiry into that nomineeÃÂs scam ÃÂuniversityÃÂ would be enormous news. But we continue to hear almost nothing about what happened between Donald Trump and Florida attorney general Pam Bondi.

I raised this issue last week, but itÃÂs worth an update as well as some contextualization. The story re-emerged last week when The PostÃÂs David A. Fahrenthold reported that Trump paid a penalty to the IRS after his foundation made an illegal contribution to BondiÃÂs PAC. While the Trump organization characterizes that as a bureaucratic oversight, the basic facts are that BondiÃÂs office had received multiple complaints from Floridians who said they were cheated by Trump University; while they were looking into it and considering whether to join a lawsuit over Trump University filed by the attorney general of New York State, Bondi called Trump and asked him for a $25,000 donation; shortly after getting the check, BondiÃÂs office dropped the inquiry.

At this point we should note that everything here may be completely innocent. Perhaps Bondi didnÃÂt realize her office was looking into Trump University. Perhaps the fact that TrumpÃÂs foundation made the contribution (which, to repeat, is illegal) was just a mix-up. Perhaps when Trump reimbursed the foundation from his personal account, he didnÃÂt realize thatÃÂs not how the law works (the foundation would have to get its money back from BondiÃÂs PAC; he could then make a personal donation if he wanted). Perhaps BondiÃÂs decision not to pursue the case against Trump was perfectly reasonable. 

But hereÃÂs the thing: We donÃÂt know the answers to those questions, because almost nobody seems to be pursuing them.

For instance, there was only one mention of this story on any of the five Sunday shows, when John Dickerson asked Chris Christie about it on ÃÂFace the NationÃÂ (Christie took great umbrage: ÃÂI canÃÂt believe, John, that anyone would insult Pam Bondi that wayÃÂ). And the comparison with stories about Hillary ClintonÃÂs emails or the Clinton Foundation is extremely instructive. Whenever we get some new development in any of those Clinton stories, you see blanket coverage ÃÂ every cable network, every network news program, every newspaper investigates it at length. And even when the new information serves to exonerate Clinton rather than implicate her in wrongdoing, the coverage still emphasizes that the whole thing just ÃÂraises questionsÃÂ about her integrity.

The big difference is that there are an enormous number of reporters who get assigned to write stories about those issues regarding Clinton. The story of something like the Clinton Foundation gets stretched out over months and months with repeated tellings, always with the insistence that questions are being raised and the implication that shady things are going on, even if there isnÃÂt any evidence at a particular moment to support that idea.

When it comes to Trump, on the other hand, weÃÂve seen a very different pattern. HereÃÂs what happens: A story about some kind of corrupt dealing emerges, usually from the dogged efforts of one or a few journalists; it gets discussed for a couple of days; and then it disappears. Someone might mention it now and again, but the news organizations donÃÂt assign a squad of reporters to look into every aspect of it, so no new facts are brought to light and no new stories get written.

The end result of this process is that because of all that repeated examination of ClintonÃÂs affairs, people become convinced that she must be corrupt to the core. ItÃÂs not that there isnÃÂt plenty of negative coverage of Trump, because of course there is, but itÃÂs focused mostly on the crazy things he says on any given day.

But the truth is that youÃÂd have to work incredibly hard to find a politician who has the kind of history of corruption, double-dealing, and fraud that Donald Trump has. The number of stories which could potentially deserve hundreds and hundreds of articles is absolutely staggering. HereÃÂs a partial list:

TrumpÃÂs casino bankruptcies, which left investors holding the bag while he skedaddled with their money
TrumpÃÂs habit of refusing to pay contractors who had done work for him, many of whom are struggling small businesses
Trump University, which includes not only the people who got scammed and the Florida investigation, but also a similar story from Texas where the investigation into Trump U was quashed.
The Trump Institute, another get-rich-quick scheme in which Trump allowed a couple of grifters to use his name to bilk people out of their money
The Trump Network, a multi-level marketing venture (a.k.a. pyramid scheme) that involved customers mailing in a urine sample which would be analyzed to produce for them a specially formulated package of multivitamins
Trump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally, and kept them in squalid conditions while they earned almost nothing for the work they did
TrumpÃÂs employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, which involves a claim that he canÃÂt find Americans to do the work
TrumpÃÂs use of hundreds of undocumented workers from Poland in the 1980s, who were paid a pittance for their illegal work
TrumpÃÂs history of being charged with housing discrimination
TrumpÃÂs connections to mafia figures involved in New York construction
The time Trump paid the Federal Trade Commission $750,000 over charges that he violated anti-trust laws when trying to take over a rival casino company
The fact that Trump is now being advised by Roger Ailes, who was forced out as Fox News chief when dozens of women came forward to charge him with sexual harassment. According to the allegations, AilesÃÂs behavior was positively monstrous; as just one indicator, his abusive and predatory actions toward women were so well-known and so loathsome that in 1968 the morally upstanding folks in the Nixon administration refused to allow him to work there despite his key role in getting Nixon elected.
And that last one is happening right now. To repeat, the point is not that these stories have never been covered, because they have. The point is that they get covered briefly, then everyone in the media moves on. If any of these kinds of stories involved Clinton, news organizations would rush to assign multiple reporters to them, those reporters would start asking questions, and weÃÂd learn more about all of them.

ThatÃÂs important, because we may have reached a point where the frames around the candidates are locked in: Trump is supposedly the crazy/bigoted one, and Clinton is supposedly the corrupt one. Once we decide that those are the appropriate lenses through which the two candidates are to be viewed, it shapes the decisions the media make every day about which stories are important to pursue.

And it means that to a great extent, for all the controversy he has caused and all the unflattering stories in the press about him, Trump is still being let off the hook."	0
167	"Russian President Vladimir Putin downplayed Donald Trump's tweet Thursday calling for the United States to expand its nuclear capabilities.

""There's nothing out of the ordinary here,"" Putin said, since the U.S. president-elect had advocated a stronger military throughout his election campaign.

The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes
ÃÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016
Putin took a deep dive into U.S. politics on Friday during his annual news conference in Moscow, praising Trump and skewering President Obama and Hillary Clinton. During a marathon Q&A session that lasted almost four hours, reporters kept returning to the accusations of Kremlin interference in the U.S. presidential election. Putin took them on with gusto, at times sounding like a Trump surrogate.

""The current administration and the Democratic Party leadership are trying to blame all their failures on external factors,"" Putin said.

The Russian president said he agreed with Trump that anybody ÃÂ even someone lying on their sofa ÃÂ could have hacked the Democratic National Committee. The most important thing, according to Putin, is the information that came out of the hack, namely the machinations among top Democrats.

America's ""ruling party,"" he said, has clearly forgotten the original meaning of the word ""democratic.""

The fact that a growing number of Republicans has a favorable view of Putin shows that a ""significant portion"" of Americans shares the concerns and ""traditional values"" of Russians, Putin said, adding that mutual sympathy could be the basis for closer relations in the future.

He took issue with Obama's assertion last week that late Republican President Ronald Reagan ""would roll over in his grave"" because of Putin's popularity in the GOP. On the contrary, Putin said, Reagan would be happy that Republicans are winning everywhere and had Trump, who understood the mood of the people.

""He went all the way, even though only we believed that he would win,"" Putin said to laughter and applause.

On Friday, Trump said in a statement that he received ""a very nice letter"" from Putin, adding that ""his thoughts are so correct.""

In an indication that he's through with Obama, Putin said it's more likely that great Democrats are turning over in their graves. Unlike President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who united Americans, the outgoing administration divided them, Putin said.

Even as he insisted on Russia's inability to sway the U.S. elections, Putin didn't hesitate to criticize the ""archaic nature"" of the Electoral College.

What he didn't mention is that Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million votes."	0
168	"ConservativesÃÂ efforts to recruit a candidate to compete against Donald Trump may have only been able to come up with David French, a National Review writer, who is merely contemplating the possibility of running. But last week, a new potential candidate stepped up to the stage, if not for this race, possibly for a future one. Dwayne Johnson, the actor formerly known by his professional wrestling moniker The Rock, told British GQ that heÃÂs considered a different kind of career.

ÃÂIÃÂll be honest, I havenÃÂt ruled politics out. IÃÂm not being coy when I say that, but at the moment I am not sure,ÃÂ Johnson said. ÃÂI canÃÂt deny that the thought of being governor, the thought of being president, is alluring. And beyond that, it would be an opportunity to make a real impact on peopleÃÂs lives on a global scale. But there are a lot of other things I want to do first.ÃÂ

The prospect of yet another former reality-television star running for higher office may feel improbable at best and horrifying at worst, given TrumpÃÂs performance in the 2016 campaign thus far. And I canÃÂt vouch for JohnsonÃÂs position on the issues ÃÂ though heÃÂs registered as a Republican and has appeared at the Republican convention to boost voter registration,* heÃÂs generally talked less about actual policy and spent more time flashing his famously winning smile:


But just as I was an early champion of JohnsonÃÂs acting abilities ÃÂ heÃÂs fascinating as a gay, closeted driver in ÃÂBe Cool,ÃÂ mesmerizing as a an amnesiac who is not doing well in the post-apocalypse in ÃÂSouthland TalesÃÂ and one of the funniest parts of Michael BayÃÂs wildly underrated ÃÂPain & GainÃÂ ÃÂ IÃÂve long thought that Johnson had a weirdly plausible path to a political career.

He grew up all around the country because of his fatherÃÂs job but makes his home in Florida, an important state in presidential election years and the place where he played football for the University of Miami. (The locker room was named for him after he made a major donation). Since his pivot to movie stardom, Johnson has become one of the most consistently likable celebrities in America, as measured by the Q Scores Company; heÃÂd begin any race not just with high name recognition, but also with high favorable ratings. Johnson is even descended from James Bowles, a free black man who fought with the British during the Revolutionary War when the kingdom offered land and freedom to black Americans who joined their side. (His motherÃÂs side of the family is Samoan.)

For a Republican Party that was desperate to woo nonwhite voters before Donald Trump tossed his toupee in the ring, and will be even harder-pressed to woo them once our present mess is over, Johnson could be the sort of person the GOP tries to renovate into a viable candidate.

If he doesnÃÂt have policy or issue bona fides, JohnsonÃÂs relative silence on substance also means he doesnÃÂt have a record that can be used to tar him as some sort of flip-flopper. And he could also make a series of carefully selected charitable and political donations designed to start building a record of positions. ItÃÂs easier to teach talking points than charisma, as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) experienced earlier this year.

Of course, if he really was going to try to follow Ronald ReaganÃÂs path to the presidency, Johnson would certainly have to run for something else first. And he could do it as early as this year: Johnson has until June 24 to get on the primary ballot in Florida and join the candidates who are competing for the Senate seat Marco Rubio decided to vacate when he ran for president.

The prospect of The Rock sitting through committee hearings might be vaguely ridiculous, and a governorship would probably require him to take fewer potentially damaging votes. But the lesson of this year in American politics is that stranger things can always happen. And Trump is proof that if our politics are turning into reality-television competitions, the results could always be worse."	0
169	"OTTAWA ÃÂ Prime Minister Justin TrudeauÃÂs Liberal government is backing away from a promise on electoral reform by claiming they didnÃÂt get enough votes in the past federal election to reform the current first-past-the-post system.

ÃÂI think we need to remember that as a result of our first-past-the-post system, only 39.5% of people voted for us,ÃÂ explained Trudeau in an interview with Le Devoir. ÃÂThis simply isnÃÂt a sufficient mandate to reform the system that produced this outcome.ÃÂ

ÃÂNow I did say that the 2015 federal election would be the last election that uses first-past-the-post, but I was expecting at least half or two-thirds of Canadians to vote for me and my party. I should have crushed Saskatchewan and Alberta with 75% of the vote, but ÃÂ again, due to factors out of our control at the time ÃÂ could only muster five seats.ÃÂ

Trudeau also noted that many of his MPs didnÃÂt receive a majority of votes in their riding as a justification for backing away from his promise.

ÃÂJust look at Minister of Democratic Institutions Maryam Monsef. She only won her riding by less that 44% of the vote! How can a Minister have the legitimacy of leading the change of our electoral system when 56% of her constituents voted against her?ÃÂ

The Prime Minister added that the only way for his government to gain legitimacy to carry out a new voting system, such as proportional representation or preferential balloting, would to re-elect a Liberal government using the current system several times over.

ÃÂBut voters shouldnÃÂt think the voter reform will never happen; weÃÂll be strongly committed to the idea next time weÃÂre in opposition.ÃÂ"	0
170	"Bill English, New ZealandÃÂs finance minister and a former farmer, will be sworn in as the countryÃÂs 39th prime minister on Monday after his colleagues in the Parliament chose him as their new leader. 

English emerged victorious from a meeting of the conservative National Party caucus. Two other candidates for the job withdrew last week after English gained more support than them. He is to be officially sworn in on Monday afternoon. 

His ascension from deputy prime minister follows the surprise resignation last week of John Key after eight years as prime minister. 

Key was a popular leader and was expected to contest a fourth straight election next year. But he said he wanted to leave while he was on top and to spend more time with his wife and two children. 

English, 54, has degrees in commerce and literature. He has been praised for his handling of the countryÃÂs economy in his role as finance minister. 

A practicing Roman Catholic, English has been a politician for 26 years, after he was first elected to the parliament in 1990. He had a previous unsuccessful stint as party leader, taking his party to a big election defeat in 2002. He said heÃÂs gained wisdom and experience since then. 

ÃÂI was 39 years old then, with six children under 13,ÃÂ he said last week. ÃÂSo if nothing else, IÃÂve got the opportunity to focus much more on the job now.ÃÂ 

Under English, New Zealand has been enjoying relatively robust annual GDP growth of more than 3 percent and the unemployment rate has fallen below 5 percent. English has also managed to return small surpluses on the governmentÃÂs books over the past couple of years. 

English said he will deliver tax cuts and spread the countryÃÂs growing wealth to where it is needed."	0

172	PANGSAU, MYANMARÃÂThinking quickly to thwart disaster as he ventured deep into the Myanmar rainforest to meet with State Councilor Aung San Suu Kyi, Secretary of State John Kerry threw a vine over a pit of quicksand to save the life of his 12-year-old Moroccan companion, Drumstick, sources confirmed Monday. ÃÂGrab on, kid!ÃÂ said Kerry, flinging the makeshift lifeline he had hacked off a tree with his machete to the rapidly sinking boy, an orphan who reportedly has tagged along with the American diplomat ever since helping him escape from Marrakesh police in 2013 via a series of hidden backstreets. ÃÂFor a minute there, I thought I was going to lose you.

173	"Background
In high school, Alexander participated in Model United Nations and successfully negotiated a peace accord between the Jordan delegate who was accused of stealing the lunch money of the Chilean delegate. Alexander attended the least-elitist Oxford college, Balliol, known for its laid-back attitude and having only three British Prime Ministers as alumni. His marriage to a Danish woman was arranged by Canada and Denmark to prevent further bloodshed in the conflict over Hans Island. While working as a diplomat for many years, he became tired of negotiation, compromise, and understanding, so he entered Canadian politics. In the Harper Cabinet, he required all new immigrants to remove their niqabs and wear their favourite NHL hockey jersey during citizenship oath ceremonies. He is best known for his undercover investigation of CBC host Rosemary Barton which found her solely responsible for causing the Syrian refugee crisis and then never reporting on it.

174	"Tonight, Donald J. Trump accepted the Republican PartyÃÂs nomination for president of the United States.

And I am, for the first time since I began covering American politics, genuinely afraid.

Donald Trump is not a man who should be president. This is not an ideological judgment. This is not something I would say about Mitt Romney or Marco Rubio. This is not a disagreement over Donald TrumpÃÂs tax plan or his climate policies. This is about TrumpÃÂs character, his temperament, his impulsiveness, his basic decency.

Back in February, I wrote that Trump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory. He pairs terrible ideas with an alarming temperament; he's a racist, a sexist, and a demagogue, but he's also a narcissist, a bully, and a dilettante. He lies so constantly and so fluently that it's hard to know if he even realizes he's lying. He delights in schoolyard taunts and luxuriates in backlash.

He has had plenty of time to prove me, and everyone else, wrong. But he hasnÃÂt. He has not become more responsible or more sober, more decent or more generous, more considered or more informed, more careful or more kind. He has continued to retweet white supremacists, make racist comments, pick unnecessary fights, contradict himself on the stump, and show an almost gleeful disinterest in building a real campaign or learning about policy.

He has, instead, run a campaign based on stoking fear and playing to resentment. His speech tonight invoked a nightmarish American hellscape that doesn't actually exist. His promise to restore order made him sound like the aspiring strongman his critics fear him to be. ""I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end,"" he said. ""Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.""

Here is what we know ÃÂ truly know ÃÂ about Trump. Here is why he should not be president.

Trump is vindictive. So far, the unifying theme of TrumpÃÂs convention is that the leader of the opposition party should be thrown in jail. Trump didnÃÂt like the Washington PostÃÂs coverage of his campaign, so he barred its reporters from his rallies and threatened to use the power of the presidency to bring an antitrust suit against the Post's owner, Jeff Bezos.

He was upset that Ohio didnÃÂt vote for him, so he sat its delegation in the cheap seats, even though the state is hosting the convention. He was angry about an interview his ex-ghostwriter gave to the New Yorker, so he sent his lawyers after him. He hates the protesters who interrupt his campaigns, so he said he would look into paying the legal fees of a supporter who sucker-punched one of them.

Imagine Donald Trump with the powers of the presidency. Imagine what he could do ÃÂ what he would do ÃÂ to those who crossed him.

Trump is a bigot. Donald Trump kicked off his campaign calling Mexican immigrants murderers and rapists. He responded to Ted CruzÃÂs surge in Iowa by calling for a ban on Muslim travel. He sought to discredit a US-born judge by saying his rulings were suspect because of his ""Mexican heritage."" TrumpÃÂs campaign is certainly the first time in my memory that a sitting speaker of the House has had to describe something his partyÃÂs nominee said as ""the textbook definition of a racist comment.""

This is not a man who should be put in charge of an increasingly diverse country that needs to find allies in an increasingly diverse world.

Trump is a sexist. Stories of TrumpÃÂs casual sexism abound, but during the campaign, it was women who questioned him who felt the full force of his misogyny. The first Republican debate, for instance, was hosted by Fox News and moderated by Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier, and Chris Wallace. Kelly wasnÃÂt obviously tougher on Trump than her colleagues, but she was the antagonist he focused on, retweeting a follower who said she was ""a bimbo"" and saying she had ""blood coming out of her ÃÂ wherever.""

After Carly Fiorina challenged him in a debate, Trump said to Rolling Stone, ""Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?"" After Hillary Clinton needed to take a bathroom break during a debate, Trump told the crowd, ""It's too disgusting. Don't say it, it's disgusting.""

ItÃÂs not just during political campaigns that this side of Trump emerges. Trump once told his friend Philip Johnson that the secret to women was ""[y]ou have to treat 'em like shit.""

Trump is a liar. Trump boasts constantly that he had the judgment and foresight to oppose the Iraq War. But he didnÃÂt. On September 11, 2002, Trump was asked by Howard Stern whether he supported the invasion of Iraq. ""Yeah, I guess so,"" he replied. Trump has not sought to explain these comments or offer evidence of an alternative judgment he offered elsewhere. He just lies about this, and he does so often.

But thatÃÂs true for Trump across many issues. He says his health care plan will insure everyone, when it will do nothing of the kind. He says his tax plan raises taxes on the wealthy when it actually cuts them sharply. Trump has lied about his net worth, his reasons for not releasing his tax returns, and his charitable donations. He lies easily, fluently, shamelessly, constantly.

Trump is a narcissist. TrumpÃÂs towering self-regard worked for him as a real estate developer. His real business was licensing his name out for building, menswear, golf courses, steaks. A bit of a narcissism is necessary to become a global brand. But the trait is maladaptive in a presidential candidate.

The most recent example was the 28 minutes he spent talking about himself when he was supposed to be introducing Mike Pence, his vice presidential candidate, for the first time. The most grotesque example was when he responded to the deadliest mass shooting in American history by tweeting, ""Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism.""

Trump admires authoritarian dictators for their authoritarianism. When MSNBC's Joe Scarborough asked Trump about his affection for Vladimir Putin, who ""kills journalists, political opponents and invades countries,"" Trump replied, ""He's running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country.""

But itÃÂs not just Putin. Trump has praised Saddam Hussein because ""he killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn't read them the rights."" He said ""you've got to give [Kim Jong Un] credit. He goes in, he takes over, and he's the boss. It's incredible."" ItÃÂs not just that Trump admires these authoritarians; itÃÂs that the thing he admires about them is their authoritarianism ÃÂ their ability to dispense with niceties like a free press, due process, and political opposition.


Trump is a conspiracy theorist. Trump burst onto the scene as a leader of the absurd ""birther"" movement. HeÃÂs said that Bill Ayers is the real author of Barack ObamaÃÂs Dreams From My Father, explained that the unemployment rate in America is really over 40 percent, and suggested that both Antonin Scalia and Vince Foster were murdered.

Trump is very, very gullible. This is related to his conspiracy theories, but Trump has a habit of believing and retweeting bad information that sounds good to him at the time.

This has led to, among other things, Trump retweeting false crime statistics, Trump retweeting Mussolini quotes from a Twitter account called Il Duce, Trump promoting a fake video claiming a protester who rushed his stage was sent by ISIS, and Trump endorsing a National Enquirer report suggesting Ted CruzÃÂs dad helped kill JFK. When pressed about these sundry embarrassments, Trump said, ""All I know is whatÃÂs on the internet.""

ThatÃÂs a reasonable response from your uncle who forwards you weird email chains, but not from a presidential candidate.

Trump doesnÃÂt apologize, and his defensiveness escalates situations. On Monday night, it became very clear that Melania TrumpÃÂs 2016 convention speech had lifted two paragraphs from Michelle ObamaÃÂs 2008 convention speech. The error was an embarrassment, but it could have been dispatched quickly by simply admitting fault and apologizing.

Instead, the Trump campaign turned it into a multi-day story and a character issue by denying anything had happened and blaming Hillary Clinton. This is ""an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, how she seeks out to demean her and take her down,"" said campaign chair Paul Manafort, in one of the most genuinely ridiculous comments in recent American history.

The campaign also tried to argue that Michelle Obama doesnÃÂt own the English language, and that similar language was used by Twilight Sparkle, a My Little Pony (IÃÂm serious). Finally, days later, the Trump campaign admitted there was plagiarism and blamed a miscommunication between Melania and her speechwriter.

A similar pattern played out when Trump tweeted an anti-Hillary meme that superimposed a Star of David atop a pile of money and accused Clinton of corruption. The image was obviously anti-Semitic, and the Trump campaign quickly took it down. But Trump himself went on a Twitter rampage, arguing that what was clearly a Star of David was actually just a sheriffÃÂs star, or maybe just a regular old star, and that the campaign shouldnÃÂt have removed the offending meme in the first place.

So far, these examples are farce, but as Tim Lee writes, this tendency in the Oval Office could lead to tragedy: ""[TrumpÃÂs] behavior on the campaign trail suggests that he would be unlikely to admit mistakes and defuse tense situations. Instead, his first instinct would be to escalate every conflict in an effort to bully foreign adversaries into giving him his way. That might work in some cases. But in others ÃÂ especially against powerful countries like China or Russia ÃÂ the results could be disastrous.""

Trump surrounds himself with sycophants. It's tradition for presidential candidates to release a note from their physician testifying to their fitness to fulfill the duties of the presidency. On December 14, Donald Trump submitted his entry to this quadrennial custom.

""If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,"" Dr. Harold Bornstein writes. ""His blood pressure, 110/65, and laboratory test results were astonishingly excellent. ÃÂ His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary.""

This is ÃÂ not how most doctor notes read. ""Reached for comment regarding this, a spokesperson at the American Medical Association just giggled,"" reported the Daily Beast.

There are many positions where one might accept a pliable crony. But ""personal physician"" should not be one of them. The fact that Trump would entrust his health to a doctor who would sign off on a note like this should terrify his family and friends. But more than that, it should disqualify him from the presidency.

Trump has proven too lazy to learn about policy. Trump didnÃÂt know much about policy when the campaign started, and as far as anyone can tell, he hasnÃÂt made any obvious effort to rectify that.

The latest and most damaging example is his interview with the New York Times, in which he said he would not automatically defend NATO countries against attack from Russia. ItÃÂs not obvious Trump meant to say that, or even knew what saying that meant, as Manafort immediately began denying Trump had ever said it. (The Times subsequently released a transcript showing that, yes, Trump had said it.)

But this is a pattern for Trump, who doesnÃÂt bother to come up with convincing answers even to obvious questions, and definitely has not put in the time to develop a deep understanding of the issues he might face as president. As Matt Yglesias wrote, this is very much a choice Trump has made. ""Trump is now the GOP nominee, and there are hundreds of professional Republican Party politicians and operatives around the country who would gladly help him become a sharper, better-informed candidate. It doesnÃÂt happen because he canÃÂt be bothered.""

Trump has run an incompetent campaign and convention. As brilliant as Trump has been in securing media attention for himself and channeling the anxieties of conservative voters, he hasnÃÂt bothered to build a real campaign organization, and his convention has been a festival of unforced errors.

This is the context of Melania TrumpÃÂs plagiarism, of Ted CruzÃÂs anti-endorsement, of the night that was supposed to be about jobs and the economy but was actually about Benghazi and jailing Hillary Clinton. In isolation, these are gaffes, mistakes, bad luck. Together, though, they tell a damning story of organizational incompetence.

The most generous interpretation of this is that Trump is capable of running an effective organization, but heÃÂs just not interested in conventions and field operations in the way he is interested in golf courses and condos. Others have certainly testified to the trouble Trump has focusing on tasks that donÃÂt engage him. His former ghostwriter says, ""He has no attention span."" Unfortunately, the president actually needs to focus on all kinds of dull and unpleasant tasks.

Trump is a bully. Trump won the Republican nomination by proving that even adults can be bullied with schoolyard taunts. There was ""low-energy Jeb,"" and ""Little Marco,"" and ""LyinÃÂ Ted,"" and now weÃÂve got ""Crooked Hillary."" Trump made fun of Rand PaulÃÂs looks and Chris ChristieÃÂs weight and Carly FiorinaÃÂs face and a New York Times reporterÃÂs physical disability.

It seems like this shouldnÃÂt have to be said, but itÃÂs better to be kind than cruel, and thereÃÂs a deep, instinctual cruelty in Trump ÃÂ he finds peopleÃÂs weak spots, their insecurities, and he exposes them in front of crowds.

Trump has regularly incited or justified violence among his supporters. At a rally in St. Louis, Donald Trump lamented that ""nobody wants to hurt each other anymore.""

Yes, lamented.

The topic was protesters, and Trump's frustration was clear. ""They're being politically correct the way they take them out,"" he sighed. ""Protesters, they realize there are no consequences to protesting anymore. There used to be consequences. There are none anymore.""

Earlier in the campaign, two of TrumpÃÂs supporters attacked a homeless Mexican man and told the police, ""Donald Trump was right ÃÂ all these illegals need to be deported."" TrumpÃÂs response? ""I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again.""

The simple fact of it is that Donald Trump should not be president of the United States. That is not because he is too conservative, as some Democrats would have it, or because he is not conservative enough, as many Republicans would have it. ItÃÂs because the presidency is a powerful job where mistakes can kill millions, and whoever holds it needs to take that power seriously and wield it responsibly. Trump has had ample opportunity to demonstrate his sense of seriousness and responsibility. He has failed.

It is said that the benefit of AmericaÃÂs long presidential campaigns is they offer the candidates time to show us who they really are. Trump has shown us who he really is. He is a person who should not be president. That he is being brought this close to the presidency ÃÂ that he is one major mistake by Hillary Clinton away from winning it ÃÂ should scare us all. It certainly scares me."	0
175	"PHOENIX A.Z. (AP) ÃÂ For months now, rumors have circulated the Internet that individuals were being paid to protest at rallies held by presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Today a man from TrumpÃÂs rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona back in March has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event.

ÃÂI was given $3,500 to protest Donald TrumpÃÂs rally in Fountain Hills,ÃÂ said 37-year-old Paul Horner. ÃÂI answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part.ÃÂ

Trump supporters have been claiming that protesters are being paid by the Bernie SandersÃÂ campaign, but Horner disagrees.

ÃÂAs for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary ClintonÃÂs campaign,ÃÂ Horner said. ÃÂThe actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called ÃÂWomen Are The FutureÃÂ. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is.ÃÂ Horner continued, ÃÂIt was mostly women in their 60ÃÂs at the interview that I went to. Plus, all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address. No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton.ÃÂ

ÃÂI knew those werenÃÂt real protesters, they were too organized and smart,ÃÂ said 59-year-old Tom Downey, a Trump supporter who attended the rally in Fountain Hills. ÃÂI knew there was something up when they started shouting all these facts and nonsense like that. The best we could do was just yell and punch emÃÂ and stuff.ÃÂ Downey continued, ÃÂI think we did a good job though. I was shouting at them the whole time, calling them losers, telling them to get a job or go back home to mommyÃÂs house; I got a bunch of high-fives from my fellow Trump supporters. It was a great time.ÃÂ

When asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally.

ÃÂAlmost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos $500, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750. I donÃÂt think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received $300 across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years backÃÂ



Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not understand why Trump protesters would need to be paid.

ÃÂIÃÂll protest that guy for free,ÃÂ Bradley said. ÃÂTrump is creating a place for like-minded, ignorant, bigoted, hate-filled individuals to gather and unite. You wouldnÃÂt have to pay me anything to protest that.ÃÂ Bradley continued, ÃÂTrump supporters are the last kind of people to donate socks to the homeless, they only care about themselves and their white race. I would love the day I ever see a donation from a Trump supporter, I think it would make me change my opinion about them.ÃÂ

Horner said the group had a mandatory six-hour training class that had to be completed before protesting at TrumpÃÂs rally.

ÃÂDuring training we were taught chants to shout like ÃÂDump TrumpÃÂ and ÃÂTrump Is A RacistÃÂ, things like that. We were told how to respond to anti-Trump comments too. If a Trump supporter said something about how great his wall will be, the Latinos in our group would say, ÃÂWeÃÂre just going to tunnel underneath it.ÃÂ They even gave me a shirt to wear at the rally which said ÃÂF*ck Donald TrumpÃÂ along with a sign to hold that said ÃÂMake America White AgainÃÂ.ÃÂ

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

ÃÂYou have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the Silverback gorilla my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a child,ÃÂ Mikkleson said. ÃÂWe claim ÃÂto provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as wellÃÂ, but thatÃÂs just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thatÃÂs it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and IÃÂm only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.ÃÂ Mikkelson continues, ÃÂIt is common for us to rewrite a story weÃÂre debunking if we donÃÂt like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a personÃÂs name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,ÃÂ Mikkelson laughs. ÃÂAnd lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as ÃÂa clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false ÃÂnewsÃÂ storiesÃÂ. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We donÃÂt list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; ItÃÂs just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, IÃÂd say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.ÃÂ

ABC News reached out to Hillary ClintonÃÂs campaign for comment but did not receive a response."	1
176	"TurkeyÃÂs President Recep Erdogan has come out swinging today. With the U.S. led coalition (Britain and France included) recently suffering an embarrassing defeat in Aleppo, Syria when Iranian and Russian forces helped to liberate the city from ISIL, this latest incident could be seen as Turkey throwing salt on the U.S. wound. 

ErdoganÃÂs bombshell statements highlighted what most of the world is now coming to accept as reality:

ÃÂThey [the U.S.] give support to terrorist groups including Daesh (IS/ISIL). We have confirmed evidence, with pictures, photos and videos.ÃÂ

While no videos or pictures have been made public yet, the world can only hope that Erdogan and company can make good on his words by publicly disclosing their alleged evidence.

Adding to the disclosure was IranÃÂs Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan:

The Western coalition is of a formal nature, they have no real intention to fight neither in Syria nor in Iraq. We donÃÂt see any readiness on their part to play a truly useful and meaningful role in fighting IS, because itÃÂs them who have raised terrorists and they are interested in keeping them there. Maybe the coalition forces would like to see terrorists weakened, but certainly not destroyed, because those terrorists are their tool for destabilizing this region and some other parts of the world.ÃÂ

Of course, this statement is no longer just a theory or speculation, as U.S. House Representative from Hawaii, Tulsi Gabbard has introduced a bill that would stop the U.S. government from funding and supporting ISIL, both directly and indirectly. Tulsi stated a few things sure to get the attention of many:

ÃÂIf you or I gave money, weapons or support to al-Qaeda or ISIS, we would be thrown in jail. Why does our gov get a free pass on this? The CIA has also been funneling weapons and money through Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and others who provide direct and indirect support to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda. This madness must end. We must stop arming terrorists. The Government must end this hypocrisy and abide by the same laws that apply to itsÃÂ citizens.ÃÂ 

What is most interesting about ErdoganÃÂs comments today then is the fact that he is calling out the U.S. government for funding and arming ISIL and other terrorists groups, when he has also been called out for doing the same. Remember from the paragraph above that Tulsi Gabbard said Turkey is one of the countries arming and funding ISIL. We must also remember when Vladimir Putin said the same thing in November of 2015.

So, perhaps Turkey (or certain aspects within the military and intelligence community within Turkey) have stopped coordinating with the CIA and other intelligence groups in helping to aid ISIL. Putin and Erdogan have made it no secret as to their willingness to collaborate more over the past several months. One of the biggest signals of this growing collaboration between Russia and Turkey was the signing of the ÃÂTurkish StreamÃÂ pipeline in late October. Additionally, Moscow announced today that they will be ÃÂintensifying cooperationÃÂ between Turkey, Iran and themselves within Syria. Maybe, just maybe, Turkey has broken ties with the Western banking/political cabal. Time will tell. 

It would make sense though in many ways if Turkey has broken off all or most ties with the Western cabal, as the world sees the writing on the wall for ISIL: Time is short.

Not only was ISIL defeated in Aleppo (the biggest battle to date), but they are being defeated in Mosul, Iraq. Today, IraqÃÂs Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told the world that ISIL would be defeated in Iraq within three months. 

Perhaps Turkey has made a full pivot East and is now working to defeat the terrorist group they were once arming and funding. Stranger things have happened. We watch in great anticipation as to what will happen next. "	1
177	"Calling it a 'total disaster', president-elect Donald Trump pledged in a video clip posted on YouTube today that he will scrap Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative on his first day in office.

Launched in 2010 with a mission to combat childhood obesity by promoting exercise and improving access to healthier food choices for children in underserved communities, Let's Move has failed to achieve any of its goals, the president-elect claims.

""It's a total disaster. A complete joke. Kids today are fatter than ever,"" Trump said. ""Maybe vegetables make you fat. Who knows? We're going to look into it.""

Trump indicated his administration would replace the campaign with one that promotes jobs and economic growth.

""These kids don't need to play, they need jobs. Nobody's going to pay anyone to play hopscotch,"" he remarked. ""And not only is working a great form of exercise, it will help their parents pay the bills.""

Trump went on to say that he would work with Congress to have the provisions regulating child labor removed from the Fair Labor Standards Act, or simply repeal the entire law altogether in order to make way for his Get to Work initiative."	1
178	"A historic number of ÃÂfaithlessÃÂ electors -- seven in total--each cast their ballots on Monday for a candidate other than the one who won his or her state. What may be more surprising, given the level of protests against Donald Trump and the pressure exerted on Republican electors, is that a greater number were untrue to Hillary Clinton than to Mr. Trump.

Among the 538 electors chosen to represent their states in the Electoral College, five were faithless to the Democratic nominee and two to the Republican. Prior to this year, there hasnÃÂt been more than one faithless elector in any presidential election since 1948.

What is next for the Electoral College?
Among the Democratic faithless electors was David Mulinix, of Hawaii, who cast his vote for Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton. He said he believes the Electoral College is ÃÂoutdated,ÃÂ according to Hawaii News Now, which also pointed out that though Hawaii forbids faithless electors, MulinixÃÂs vote still counted and he would face no punishment because Hawaii has never bothered to come up with a penalty for breaking the law.

Four of the ÃÂfaithlessÃÂ electors came from Washington, a state won by Clinton. Three of them--Bret Chiafalo, 19-year-old Levi Guerra, and Esther John-- cast their votes for former Secretary of State Colin Powell, according to the Seattle Times. They also participated in a movement started by Chiafalo. The so-called ÃÂHamilton ElectorsÃÂ base their ideology on Alexander Hamilton--one of the Founding Fathers who wrote about the Electoral College in the Federalist Papers.  

The fourth ÃÂfaithlessÃÂ elector, Robert Satiacum, voted for Faith Spotted Eagle--a woman who is a member of the Yankton Sioux Nation, according to a local NBC affiliate. She played a public role in opposing the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.

President-elect Trump lost Texas elector Christopher Suprun to John Kasich. Another Texas elector, Bill Greene, voted for Libertarian Ron Paul, according to the Texas Monthly. 

Though there is no Constitutional provision or federal law barring electors from voting for whom they are pledged, more than half of the states, including D.C., ÃÂbindÃÂ their electors. The rest of electors may have the legal authority to vote for whomever they want, but, as CBS News previously reported, faithless electors have never decided a presidential election.

The entire procedure lasted well into the evening, with the official tally coming in around 8 p.m--though the president-elect clinched the nomination with the necessary 270 votes earlier in the evening. According to a final tally, Trump received 304 votes compared to ClintonÃÂs 227.

The votes cast Monday will be sent on to the nationÃÂs capital by late December. Subsequently, on Jan. 6, Vice President Joe Biden will open the electoral votes before a joint session of the new Congress, where they will be counted one last time."	0
179	"Donald TrumpÃÂs transition team is asking State Department officials to reveal how much of their funding goes towards international environmental groups, according to a new Washington Post report. 

The query, posed in a list of questions to the State DepartmentÃÂs Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, asked, ÃÂHow much does the Department of State contribute annually to international environmental organizations in which the department participates?ÃÂ

State Department spokesperson John Kirby noted Wednesday, however, that there is ÃÂnothing out of hte normÃÂ regarding questions being asked by the transition team. 

The questions, Kirby told reporters, were ÃÂvery much aligned with their need to better understand the bureaucracy and organization that theyÃÂre about to lead.ÃÂ 

ÃÂNothing falls outside the normal inquiries,ÃÂ Kirby said. 

Despite State Department assurances, the inquiry has increased worries that the president-electÃÂs transition team is prioritizing a rollback of the Obama administrationÃÂs actions on climate change and conservation efforts. 

While Mr. Trump has met with prominent climate change activists since his election victory, the president-elect has also tapped several people to lead government agencies that have agendas contrary to Mr. ObamaÃÂs own climate and renewable fuel focus. For instance, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt -- who Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the Environmental Protection Agency -- is a vocal denier of climate change science and has even sued the Obama administration over its clean power plant rules. Mr. TrumpÃÂs pick for secretary of state, oil magnate Rex Tillerson, has said climate change could pose ÃÂsignificantÃÂ risks, but there is little indication that the Exxon Mobil executive will prioritze the issue. 

Mr. Trump also threatened during his campaign to scuttle the United StatesÃÂ involvement in the landmark Paris climate change accord, an international agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions and try to reverse global warming effects. The Paris treaty holds the U.S. accountable for donating $3 billion over four years to the Green Climate Fund, which is devoted to helping poorer countries weather the detrimental effects of climate change.

Similarly, the Energy Department was also recently sent a questionnaire to divulge the names of employees who had worked on climate change policies. The department said it would not be complying with that request, and the Trump transition team disavowed the original questionnaire, saying it ÃÂwas not authorized.ÃÂ

The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment confirming the Post report.

According to the White HouseÃÂs Office of Management and Budget, of the State DepartmentÃÂs 2016 budget of $30.91 billion, about $128 million was allocated for natural resources and the environment.  "	0
180	"In light of the fact that a huge swath of white nationalists and separatists in the U.S. ÃÂ from the hoary old KKK to neo-Confederates to garden-variety racists and assorted Bannonistas ÃÂ are positively giddy at the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, perhaps itÃÂs time to take stock of what it is, exactly, that whites do so well.

After all, tens of millions of Americans enthusiastically voted for a thin-skinned semi-literate, serial bankrupt and congenital groper who made a point of courting bigots and sectarians during his campaign. The least the rest of us can do is examine why so many white Americans remain so sure of their own racial supremacy, and why theyÃÂve embraced a character like Donald Trump as their knight in orange armor.

With that in mind, here in no particular order are a few things at which whites historically and unquestionably excel.

Killing Other White People ÃÂ Contrary to Mr. TrumpÃÂs puzzling insistence that 80 percent of whites killed in America are murdered by African Americans, pesky FBI statistics indicate that more than 80 percent of murdered white Americans are, in fact, killed by other whites. (Blacks accounted for less than 15 percent of white deaths in 2014, and a devastating 90 percent of black deaths. Neither of those statistics is anything to celebrate ÃÂ but nor are they suggestive of the epidemic of black-on-white violence that Trump and other fact-averse racialists continue to bleat and tweet about.)

Walking on the Moon ÃÂ To date, only 12 humans have walked on the moon. They were all white guys. Why do other races hate the moon so much? Why?

Avoiding Arrest for Illicit Drug Use ÃÂ According to a survey conducted a few years ago by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, almost 20 percent of whites have used cocaine. For Latinos and blacks, that number is closer to 10 percent. White people have also used or abused prescription pain killers (Oxy, for example), hallucinogens, and stimulants like crystal meth at higher percentage rates than most other ethnic groups.

Despite these shenanigans, blacks are arrested for drug possession more than three times as often as whites ÃÂ a discrepancy that might be due to racial bias, more aggressive policing in minority neighborhoods, or other law-enforcement vagaries. But isnÃÂt it just possible that the lower arrest rate for whites is due to the fact that some people are really good at getting away with enjoying illegal drugs, without attracting the attention of the po-po? How about some credit where credit is due?

Eating Competitively ÃÂ A weirdly high percentage of the highest ranked competitive eaters in the world ÃÂ men and women, alike ÃÂ are white. This is exactly the sort of accomplishment that billions of people in the non-white world look upon with astonishment, and envy. And empty bellies. And disgust. But mostly envy.

Drinking Donkey Semen ÃÂ Remember seeing those adorable Florida twins, Brynne and Claire Odioso, downing mugs of donkey semen and urine on an episode of ÃÂFear FactorÃÂ a few years back? Yeah, neither do I, because the network decided not to air the footage. (NBC: Global arbiter of good taste!)

But the adorable Odiosos had a good time chatting about their experience after the fact ÃÂ and who among us has not seen clips of other stomach-churning acts from the showÃÂs long, dignified run? Sure, there were some non-white contestants on ÃÂFear Factor,ÃÂ but evidently none had the heart or the class to chug donkey spunk in order to be on TV.

Saluting Like Nazis ÃÂ As a recent alt-right conference in Washington, DC, makes plain, white people are still simply the best at giving Nazi-style salutes while hollering original slogans like, ÃÂHail Trump! Hail our people!ÃÂ

Now, by ÃÂour people,ÃÂ the uber-homogeneous conference crowd might have been referring to the marvelously diverse, pluralistic society weÃÂve built here in America over centuries. But seeing as how keynote speaker and alt-right Grand Poobah Richard B. Spencer assured his audience that white people must ÃÂconquer or dieÃÂ and that America ÃÂbelongs to us,ÃÂ the attendees probably did mean ÃÂhail whites!ÃÂ after all. Which makes those straight-arm salutes that much more ÃÂ Nuremberg-y.

Keeping Non-Whites From Voting ÃÂ Give it up for the bright, white GOP: when it wants to make voting more difficult, instead of more accessible, for millions of Americans, todayÃÂs Republicans know how to get all their cute little voter-suppression ducks in a row. In fact, this yearÃÂs presidential election was the first in 50 years in which full protections of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act were not enforced across the land. Talk about supremacy!

Being Hannity ÃÂ As earnestly as people of color might yearn to be Bill OÃÂReillyÃÂs angry, insecure niece, that role is now, and always will be, filled to perfection by Sean Hannity. Sorry, folks.

Again, these are but a few of the endeavors and pursuits at which whites excel. Any sentient human could come up with countless more. Hail our people, indeed."	0

With the recent media coverage exposing police brutality and racially motivated crimes against African-Americans, Femi Adenugame, has decided to put his fortune to what he believes is good use. He has created the ÃÂBack To AfricaÃÂ movement in efforts to assist African-Americans in returning to their ÃÂmotherlandÃÂ and starting a fresh life.

Former presidential intern and the worldÃÂs second most famous presidential lay, Monica Lewinsky, has gone on record saying that she will be voting for her old flameÃÂs wife, Hillary Clinton, in the next election.

Lewinsky, who is a staunch anti-bullying activist, says she couldnÃÂt possibly vote for Trump, because heÃÂs ÃÂthe biggest bullyÃÂ sheÃÂs ever seen.

ÃÂIÃÂve spent years trying to stop bullying, in life and online, with children, teens, and adults, so what kind of message would it send if I voted for Donald Trump?ÃÂ asked Lewinsky. ÃÂI understand that there are some weird ramifications of me voting for my former loverÃÂs wife, but you know, those were different times. That dress has long since been burned, if you know what I mean.ÃÂ

Lewinsky says that she had originally thought about voting for Jill Stein, but SteinÃÂs anti-vaccine sentiment made her think better.

ÃÂItÃÂs definitely a womanÃÂs place to be in the Oval Office, behind the resolute desk, and I donÃÂt just mean on her knees,ÃÂ said Lewinsky."	1
183	"Election officials in Franklin County, Ohio are reportedly stumped over what one maintenance worker found in a dilapidated downtown Columbus warehouse earlier this week.

184	"The American media, over the past year, has been trying to work out something of a mystery: Why is the Republican electorate supporting a far-right, orange-toned populist with no real political experience, who espouses extreme and often bizarre views? How has Donald Trump, seemingly out of nowhere, suddenly become so popular?

What's made Trump's rise even more puzzling is that his support seems to cross demographic lines ÃÂ education, income, age, even religiosity ÃÂ that usually demarcate candidates. And whereas most Republican candidates might draw strong support from just one segment of the party base, such as Southern evangelicals or coastal moderates, Trump currently does surprisingly well from the Gulf Coast of Florida to the towns of upstate New York, and he won a resounding victory in the Nevada caucuses.

IX. How authoritarians will change American politics 
Perhaps strangest of all, it wasn't just Trump but his supporters who seemed to have come out of nowhere, suddenly expressing, in large numbers, ideas far more extreme than anything that has risen to such popularity in recent memory. In South Carolina, a CBS News exit poll found that 75 percent of Republican voters supported banning Muslims from the United States. A PPP poll found that a third of Trump voters support banning gays and lesbians from the country. Twenty percent said Lincoln shouldn't have freed the slaves.

Last September, a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst named Matthew MacWilliams realized that his dissertation research might hold the answer to not just one but all three of these mysteries.

MacWilliams studies authoritarianism ÃÂ not actual dictators, but rather a psychological profile of individual voters that is characterized by a desire for order and a fear of outsiders. People who score high in authoritarianism, when they feel threatened, look for strong leaders who promise to take whatever action necessary to protect them from outsiders and prevent the changes they fear.

So MacWilliams naturally wondered if authoritarianism might correlate with support for Trump.

He polled a large sample of likely voters, looking for correlations between support for Trump and views that align with authoritarianism. What he found was astonishing: Not only did authoritarianism correlate, but it seemed to predict support for Trump more reliably than virtually any other indicator. He later repeated the same poll in South Carolina, shortly before the primary there, and found the same results, which he published in Vox:

  
As it turns out, MacWilliams wasn't the only one to have this realization. Miles away, in an office at Vanderbilt University, a professor named Marc Hetherington was having his own aha moment. He realized that he and a fellow political scientist, the University of North Carolina's Jonathan Weiler, had essentially predicted Trump's rise back in 2009, when they discovered something that would turn out to be far more significant than they then realized.

That year, Hetherington and Weiler published a book about the effects of authoritarianism on American politics. Through a series of experiments and careful data analysis, they had come to a surprising conclusion: Much of the polarization dividing American politics was fueled not just by gerrymandering or money in politics or the other oft-cited variables, but by an unnoticed but surprisingly large electoral group ÃÂ authoritarians.

Their book concluded that the GOP, by positioning itself as the party of traditional values and law and order, had unknowingly attracted what would turn out to be a vast and previously bipartisan population of Americans with authoritarian tendencies.

This trend had been accelerated in recent years by demographic and economic changes such as immigration, which ""activated"" authoritarian tendencies, leading many Americans to seek out a strongman leader who would preserve a status quo they feel is under threat and impose order on a world they perceive as increasingly alien.

Trump embodies the classic authoritarian leadership style: simple, powerful, and punitive
These Americans with authoritarian views, they found, were sorting into the GOP, driving polarization. But they were also creating a divide within the party, at first latent, between traditional Republican voters and this group whose views were simultaneously less orthodox and, often, more extreme.

Over time, Hetherington and Weiler had predicted, that sorting would become more and more pronounced. And so it was all but inevitable that, eventually, authoritarians would gain enough power within the GOP to make themselves heard.

At the time, even Hetherington and Weiler did not realize the explosive implications: that their theory, when followed to its natural conclusion, predicted a looming and dramatic transformation of American politics. But looking back now, the ramifications of their research seem disturbingly clear.

Authoritarians are thought to express much deeper fears than the rest of the electorate, to seek the imposition of order where they perceive dangerous change, and to desire a strong leader who will defeat those fears with force. They would thus seek a candidate who promised these things. And the extreme nature of authoritarians' fears, and of their desire to challenge threats with force, would lead them toward a candidate whose temperament was totally unlike anything we usually see in American politics ÃÂ and whose policies went far beyond the acceptable norms.

A candidate like Donald Trump.

Even Hetherington was shocked to discover quite how right their theory had been. In the early fall of 2015, as Trump's rise baffled most American journalists and political scientists, he called Weiler. He asked, over and over, ""Can you believe this? Can you believe this?""

This winter, I got in touch with Hetherington, MacWilliams, and several other political scientists who study authoritarianism. I wanted to better understand the theory that seemed to have predicted, with such eerie accuracy, Trump's rise. And, like them, I wanted to find out what the rise of authoritarian politics meant for American politics. Was Trump just the start of something bigger?

These political scientists were, at that moment, beginning to grapple with the same question. We agreed there was something important happening here ÃÂ that was just beginning to be understood.

Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics
Shortly after the Iowa Republican caucus, in which Trump came in a close second, Vox partnered with the Washington-based media and polling company Morning Consult to test American authoritarians along a range of political and social views ÃÂ and to test some hypotheses we had developed after speaking with the leading political scientists of the field.

What we found is a phenomenon that explains, with remarkable clarity, the rise of Donald Trump ÃÂ but that is also much larger than him, shedding new light on some of the biggest political stories of the past decade. Trump, it turns out, is just the symptom. The rise of American authoritarianism is transforming the Republican Party and the dynamics of national politics, with profound consequences likely to extend well beyond this election.

For years now, before anyone thought a person like Donald Trump could possibly lead a presidential primary, a small but respected niche of academic research has been laboring over a question, part political science and part psychology, that had captivated political scientists since the rise of the Nazis.

How do people come to adopt, in such large numbers and so rapidly, extreme political views that seem to coincide with fear of minorities and with the desire for a strongman leader?

To answer that question, these theorists study what they call authoritarianism: not the dictators themselves, but rather the psychological profile of people who, under the right conditions, will desire certain kinds of extreme policies and will seek strongman leaders to implement them.

The political phenomenon we identify as right-wing populism seems to line up, with almost astonishing precision, with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressed
After an early period of junk science in the mid-20th century, a more serious group of scholars has addressed this question, specifically studying how it plays out in American politics: researchers like Hetherington and Weiler, Stanley Feldman, Karen Stenner, and Elizabeth Suhay, to name just a few.

The field, after a breakthrough in the early 1990s, has come to develop the contours of a grand theory of authoritarianism, culminating quite recently, in 2005, with Stenner's seminal The Authoritarian Dynamic ÃÂ just in time for that theory to seemingly come true, more rapidly and in greater force than any of them had imagined, in the personage of one Donald Trump and his norm-shattering rise.

According to Stenner's theory, there is a certain subset of people who hold latent authoritarian tendencies. These tendencies can be triggered or ""activated"" by the perception of physical threats or by destabilizing social change, leading those individuals to desire policies and leaders that we might more colloquially call authoritarian.

It is as if, the NYU professor Jonathan Haidt has written, a button is pushed that says, ""In case of moral threat, lock down the borders, kick out those who are different, and punish those who are morally deviant.""

Authoritarians are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump ÃÂ and will persist as a force in American politics
Authoritarians prioritize social order and hierarchies, which bring a sense of control to a chaotic world. Challenges to that order ÃÂ diversity, influx of outsiders, breakdown of the old order ÃÂ are experienced as personally threatening because they risk upending the status quo order they equate with basic security.

This is, after all, a time of social change in America. The country is becoming more diverse, which means that many white Americans are confronting race in a way they have never had to before. Those changes have been happening for a long time, but in recent years they have become more visible and harder to ignore. And they are coinciding with economic trends that have squeezed working-class white people.

When they face physical threats or threats to the status quo, authoritarians support policies that seem to offer protection against those fears. They favor forceful, decisive action against things they perceive as threats. And they flock to political leaders who they believe will bring this action.

If you were to read every word these theorists ever wrote on authoritarians, and then try to design a hypothetical candidate to match their predictions of what would appeal to authoritarian voters, the result would look a lot like Donald Trump.

But political scientists say this theory explains much more than just Donald Trump, placing him within larger trends in American politics: polarization, the rightward shift of the Republican Party, and the rise within that party of a dissident faction challenging GOP orthodoxies and upending American politics.

More than that, authoritarianism reveals the connections between several seemingly disparate stories about American politics. And it suggest that a combination of demographic, economic, and political forces, by awakening this authoritarian class of voters that has coalesced around Trump, have created what is essentially a new political party within the GOP ÃÂ a phenomenon that broke into public view with the 2016 election but will persist long after it has ended.

II. The discovery: how a niche subfield of political science suddenly became some of the most relevant research in American politics

This study of authoritarianism began shortly after World War II, as political scientists and psychologists in the US and Europe tried to figure out how the Nazis had managed to win such wide public support for such an extreme and hateful ideology.

That was a worthy field of study, but the early work wasn't particularly rigorous by today's standards. The critical theorist Theodor Adorno, for instance, developed what he called the ""F-scale,"" which sought to measure ""fascist"" tendencies. The test wasn't accurate. Sophisticated respondents would quickly discover what the ""right"" answers were and game the test. And there was no proof that the personality type it purportedly measured actually supported fascism.

More than that, this early research seemed to assume that a certain subset of people were inherently evil or dangerous ÃÂ an idea that Hetherington and Weiler say is simplistic and wrong, and that they resist in their work. (They acknowledge the label ""authoritarians"" doesn't do much to dispel this, but their efforts to replace it with a less pejorative-sounding term were unsuccessful.)

If this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trump's ascent, then how else might it be shaping American politics?
But the real problem for researchers was that even if there really were such a thing as an authoritarian psychological profile, how do you measure it? How do you interrogate authoritarian tendencies, which can sometimes be latent? How do you get honest answers on questions that can be sensitive and highly politicized?

As Hetherington explained to me, ""There are certain things that you just can't ask people directly. You can't ask people, 'Do you not like black people?' You can't ask people if they're bigots.""

For a long time, no one had a solution for this, and the field of study languished.

Then in the early 1990s, a political scientist named Stanley Feldman changed everything. Feldman, a professor at SUNY Stonybrook, believed authoritarianism could be an important factor in American politics in ways that had nothing to do with fascism, but that it could only reliably be measured by unlinking it from specific political preferences.

He realized that if authoritarianism were a personality profile rather than just a political preference, he could get respondents to reveal these tendencies by asking questions about a topic that seemed much less controversial. He settled on something so banal it seems almost laughable: parenting goals.

Feldman developed what has since become widely accepted as the definitive measurement of authoritarianism: four simple questions that appear to ask about parenting but are in fact designed to reveal how highly the respondent values hierarchy, order, and conformity over other values.

Feldman's test proved to be very reliable. There was now a way to identify people who fit the authoritarian profile, by prizing order and conformity, for example, and desiring the imposition of those values.

In 1992, Feldman convinced the National Election Study, a large survey of American voters conducted in each national election year, to include his four authoritarianism questions. Ever since, political scientists who study authoritarianism have accumulated a wealth of data on who exhibits those tendencies and on how they align with everything from demographic profiles to policy preferences.

What they found was impossible to ignore ÃÂ and is only just beginning to reshape our understanding of the American electorate.

III. How authoritarianism works

In the early 2000s, as researchers began to make use of the NES data to understand how authoritarianism affected US politics, their work revealed three insights that help explain not just the rise of Trump, but seemingly a half-century of American political dynamics.

The first was Hetherington and Weiler's insight into partisan polarization. In the 1960s, the Republican Party had reinvented itself as the party of law, order, and traditional values ÃÂ a position that naturally appealed to order- and tradition-focused authoritarians. Over the decades that followed, authoritarians increasingly gravitated toward the GOP, where their concentration gave them more and more influence over time.

The second was Stenner's theory of ""activation."" In an influential 2005 book called The Authoritarian Dynamic, Stenner argued that many authoritarians might be latent ÃÂ that they might not necessarily support authoritarian leaders or policies until their authoritarianism had been ""activated.""

The social threat theory helps explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change, such as Muslims or same-sex couples or Hispanic migrants, but rather to reject all of them
This activation could come from feeling threatened by social changes such as evolving social norms or increasing diversity, or any other change that they believe will profoundly alter the social order they want to protect. In response, previously more moderate individuals would come to support leaders and policies we might now call Trump-esque.

Other researchers, like Hetherington, take a slightly different view. They believe that authoritarians aren't ""activated"" ÃÂ they've always held their authoritarian preferences ÃÂ but that they only come to express those preferences once they feel threatened by social change or some kind of threat from outsiders.

But both schools of thought agree on the basic causality of authoritarianism. People do not support extreme policies and strongman leaders just out of an affirmative desire for authoritarianism, but rather as a response to experiencing certain kinds of threats.

The third insight came from Hetherington and American University professor Elizabeth Suhay, who found that when non-authoritarians feel sufficiently scared, they also start to behave, politically, like authoritarians.

But Hetherington and Suhay found a distinction between physical threats such as terrorism, which could lead non-authoritarians to behave like authoritarians, and more abstract social threats, such as eroding social norms or demographic changes, which do not have that effect. That distinction would turn out to be important, but it also meant that in times when many Americans perceived imminent physical threats, the population of authoritarians could seem to swell rapidly.

Together, those three insights added up to one terrifying theory: that if social change and physical threats coincided at the same time, it could awaken a potentially enormous population of American authoritarians, who would demand a strongman leader and the extreme policies necessary, in their view, to meet the rising threats.

This theory would seem to predict the rise of an American political constituency that looks an awful lot like the support base that has emerged, seemingly out of nowhere, to propel Donald Trump from sideshow loser of the 2012 GOP primary to runaway frontrunner in 2016.

Beyond being almost alarmingly prescient, this theory speaks to an oft-stated concern about Trump: that what's scariest is not the candidate, but rather the extent and fervor of his support.

And it raises a question: If this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trump's ascent, then how else might it be shaping American politics? And what effect could it have even after the 2016 race has ended?

IV. What can authoritarianism explain?

In early February, shortly after Trump finished second in the Iowa caucus and ended any doubts about his support, I began talking to Feldman, Hetherington, and MacWilliams to try to answer these questions.

MacWilliams had already demonstrated a link between authoritarianism and support for Trump. But we wanted to know how else authoritarianism was playing out in American life, from policy positions to party politics to social issues, and what it might mean for America's future.

It was time to call Kyle Dropp. Dropp is a political scientist and pollster whom one of my colleagues described as ""the Doogie Howser of polling."" He does indeed appear jarringly young for a Dartmouth professor. But he is also the co-founder of a media and polling company, Morning Consult, that had worked with Vox on several other projects.

When we approached Morning Consult, Dropp and his colleagues were excited. Dropp was familiar with Hetherington's work and the authoritarianism measure, he said, and was instantly intrigued by how we could test its relevance to the election. Hetherington and the other political scientists were, in turn, eager to more fully explore the theories that had suddenly become much more relevant.

Non-authoritarians who were sufficiently frightened of threats like terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritarians
We put together five sets of questions. The first set, of course, was the test for authoritarianism that Feldman had developed. This would allow us to measure how authoritarianism coincided or didn't with our other sets of questions.

The second set asked standard election-season questions on preferred candidates and party affiliation.

The third set tested voters' fears of a series of physical threats, ranging from ISIS and Russia to viruses and car accidents.

The fourth set tested policy preferences, in an attempt to see how authoritarianism might lead voters to support particular policies.

If the research were right, then we'd expect people who scored highly on authoritarianism to express outsize fear of ""outsider"" threats such as ISIS or foreign governments versus other threats. We also expected that non-authoritarians who expressed high levels of fear would be more likely to support Trump. This would speak to physical fears as triggering a kind of authoritarian upsurge, which would in turn lead to Trump support.

We wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election
The final set of questions was intended to test fear of social change. We asked people to rate a series of social changes ÃÂ both actual and hypothetical ÃÂ on a scale of ""very good"" to ""very bad"" for the country. These included same-sex marriage, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States, and American Muslims building more mosques in US cities.

If the theory about social change provoking stress amongst authoritarians turned out to be correct, then authoritarians would be more likely to rate the changes as bad for the country.

In the aggregate, we were hoping to do a few things. We wanted to understand who these people are, in simple demographic terms, and to test the basic hypotheses about how authoritarianism, in theory, is supposed to work. We wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election: Were they driving certain policy positions, for example?

We wanted to better understand the larger forces that had suddenly made authoritarians so numerous and so extreme ÃÂ was it migration, terrorism, perhaps the decline of working-class whites? And maybe most of all, we wanted to develop some theories about what the rise of American authoritarianism meant for the future of polarization between the parties as well as a Republican Party that had become both more extreme and internally divided.

About 10 days later, shortly after Trump won the New Hampshire primary, the poll went into the field. In less than two weeks, we had our results.

V. How the GOP became the party of authoritarians

The first thing that jumped out from the data on authoritarians is just how many there are. Our results found that 44 percent of white respondents nationwide scored as ""high"" or ""very high"" authoritarians, with 19 percent as ""very high."" That's actually not unusual, and lines up with previous national surveys that found that the authoritarian disposition is far from rare1.

The key thing to understand is that authoritarianism is often latent; people in this 44 percent only vote or otherwise act as authoritarians once triggered by some perceived threat, physical or social. But that latency is part of how, over the past few decades, authoritarians have quietly become a powerful political constituency without anyone realizing it.

Today, according to our survey, authoritarians skew heavily Republican. More than 65 percent of people who scored highest on the authoritarianism questions were GOP voters. More than 55 percent of surveyed Republicans scored as ""high"" or ""very high"" authoritarians.

And at the other end of the scale, that pattern reversed. People whose scores were most non-authoritarian ÃÂ meaning they always chose the non-authoritarian parenting answer ÃÂ were almost 75 percent Democrats.

But this hasn't always been the case. According to Hetherington and Weiler's research, this is not a story about how Republicans are from Mars and Democrats are from Venus. It's a story of polarization that increased over time.

They trace the trend to the 1960s, when the Republican Party shifted electoral strategies to try to win disaffected Southern Democrats, in part by speaking to fears of changing social norms ÃÂ for example, the racial hierarchies upset by civil rights. The GOP also embraced a ""law and order"" platform with a heavily racial appeal to white voters who were concerned about race riots.

This positioned the GOP as the party of traditional values and social structures ÃÂ a role that it has maintained ever since. That promise to stave off social change and, if necessary, to impose order happened to speak powerfully to voters with authoritarian inclinations.

Democrats, by contrast, have positioned themselves as the party of civil rights, equality, and social progress ÃÂ in other words, as the party of social change, a position that not only fails to attract but actively repels change-averse authoritarians.

Over the next several decades, Hetherington explained to me, this led authoritarians to naturally ""sort"" themselves into the Republican Party.

That matters, because as more authoritarians sort themselves into the GOP, they have more influence over its policies and candidates. It is not for nothing that our poll found that more than half of the Republican respondents score as authoritarian.

Perhaps more importantly, the party has less and less ability to ignore authoritarians' voting preferences ÃÂ even if those preferences clash with the mainstream party establishment.

VI. Trump, authoritarians, and fear
  
Based on our data, Morning Consult data scientist Adam Petrihos said that ""among Republicans, very high/high authoritarianism is very predictive of support for Trump."" Trump has 42 percent support among Republicans but, according to our survey, a full 52 percent support among very high authoritarians.

Authoritarianism was the best single predictor of support for Trump, although having a high school education also came close. And as Hetherington noted after reviewing our results, the relationship between authoritarianism and Trump support remained robust, even after controlling for education level and gender.

Trump support was much lower among Republicans who scored low on authoritarianism: only 38 percent.

But that's still awfully high. So what could explain Trump's support among non-authoritarians?

I suspected the answer might lie at least partly in Hetherington and Suhay's research on how fear affects non-authoritarian voters, so I called them to discuss the data. Hetherington crunched some numbers on physical threats and noticed two things.

The first was that authoritarians tend to fear very specific kinds of physical threats.


Authoritarians, we found in our survey, tend to most fear threats that come from abroad, such as ISIS or Russia or Iran. These are threats, the researchers point out, to which people can put a face; a scary terrorist or an Iranian ayatollah. Non-authoritarians were much less afraid of those threats. For instance, 73 percent of very high-scoring authoritarians believed that terrorist organizations like ISIS posed a ""very high risk"" to them, but only 45 percent of very low-scoring authoritarians did. Domestic threats like car accidents, by contrast, were much less frightening to authoritarians.

But Hetherington also noticed something else: A subgroup of non-authoritarians were very afraid of threats like Iran or ISIS. And the more fear of these threats they expressed, the more likely they were to support Trump.

  
This seemed to confirm his and Suhay's theory: that non-authoritarians who are sufficiently frightened of physical threats such as terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritarians.

That's important, because for years now, Republican politicians and Republican-leaning media such as Fox News have been telling viewers nonstop that the world is a terrifying place and that President Obama isn't doing enough to keep Americans safe.

There are a variety of political and media incentives for why this happens. But the point is that, as a result, Republican voters have been continually exposed to messages warning of physical dangers. As the perception of physical threat has risen, this fear appears to have led a number of non-authoritarians to vote like authoritarians ÃÂ to support Trump.

An irony of this primary is that the Republican establishment has tried to stop Trump by, among other things, co-opting his message. But when establishment candidates such as Marco Rubio try to match Trump's rhetoric on ISIS or on American Muslims, they may end up deepening the fear that can only lead voters back to Trump.

VII. Is America's changing social landscape ""activating"" authoritarianism?
But the research on authoritarianism suggests it's not just physical threats driving all this. There should be another kind of threat ÃÂ larger, slower, less obvious, but potentially even more powerful ÃÂ pushing authoritarians to these extremes: the threat of social change.

This could come in the form of evolving social norms, such as the erosion of traditional gender roles or evolving standards in how to discuss sexual orientation. It could come in the form of rising diversity, whether that means demographic changes from immigration or merely changes in the colors of the faces on TV. Or it could be any changes, political or economic, that disrupt social hierarchies.

What these changes have in common is that, to authoritarians, they threaten to take away the status quo as they know it ÃÂ familiar, orderly, secure ÃÂ and replace it with something that feels scary because it is different and destabilizing, but also sometimes because it upends their own place in society. According to the literature, authoritarians will seek, in response, a strong leader who promises to suppress the scary changes, if necessary by force, and to preserve the status quo.

This is why, in our survey, we wanted to study the degree to which authoritarians versus non-authoritarians expressed a fear of social change ÃÂ and whether this, as expected, led them to desire heavy-handed responses.

  
Our results seemed to confirm this: Authoritarians were significantly more likely to rate almost all of the actual and hypothetical social issues we asked about as ""bad"" or ""very bad"" for the country.

For instance, our results suggested that an astonishing 44 percent of authoritarians believe same-sex marriage is harmful to the country. Twenty-eight percent rated same-sex marriage as ""very bad"" for America, and another 16 percent said that itÃÂs ""bad."" Only about 35 percent of high-scoring authoritarians said same-sex marriage was ""good"" or ""very good"" for the country.

Tellingly, non-authoritarians' responses skewed in the opposite direction. Non-authoritarians tended to rate same-sex marriage as ""good"" or ""very good"" for the country.

The fact that authoritarians and non-authoritarians split over something as seemingly personal and nonthreatening as same-sex marriage is crucial for understanding how authoritarianism can be triggered by even a social change as minor as expanding marriage rights.

We also asked respondents to rate whether Muslims building more mosques in American cities was a good thing. This was intended to test respondents' comfort level with sharing their communities with Muslims ÃÂ an issue that has been particularly contentious this primary election.

  
A whopping 56.5 percent of very high-scoring authoritarians said it was either ""bad"" or ""very bad"" for the country when Muslims built more mosques. Only 14 percent of that group said more mosques would be ""good"" or ""very good.""

The literature on authoritarianism suggests this is not just simple Islamophobia, but rather reflects a broader phenomenon wherein authoritarians feel threatened by people they identify as ""outsiders"" and by the possibility of changes to the status quo makeup of their communities.

This would help explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change, such as Muslims or same-sex couples or Hispanic migrants, but rather to reject all of them. What these seemingly disparate groups have in common is the perceived threat they pose to the status quo order, which authoritarians experience as a threat to themselves.

And America is at a point when the status quo social order is changing rapidly; when several social changes are converging. And they are converging especially on working-class white people.

It is conventional wisdom to ascribe the rise of first the Tea Party right and now Trump to the notion that working-class white Americans are angry.

Indeed they are, but this data helps explain that they are also under certain demographic and economic pressures that, according to this research, are highly likely to trigger authoritarianism ÃÂ and thus suggests there is something a little more complex going on than simple ""anger"" that helps explain their gravitation toward extreme political responses.

Working-class communities have come under tremendous economic strain since the recession. And white people are also facing the loss of the privileged position that they previously were able to take for granted. Whites are now projected to become a minority group over the next few decades, owing to migration and other factors. The president is a black man, and nonwhite faces are growing more common in popular culture. Nonwhite groups are raising increasingly prominent political demands, and often those demands coincide with issues such as policing that also speak to authoritarian concerns.

Some of these factors might be considered more or less legitimately threatening than others ÃÂ the loss of working-class jobs in this country is a real and important issue, no matter how one feels about fading white privilege ÃÂ but that is not the point.

The point, rather, is that the increasingly important political phenomenon we identify as right-wing populism, or white working-class populism, seems to line up, with almost astonishing precision, with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressed.

That is not to dismiss white working-class concerns as invalid because they might be expressed by authoritarians or through authoritarian politics, but rather to better understand why this is happening ÃÂ and why it's having such a profound and extreme effect on American politics.

Have we misunderstood hard-line social conservatism all along?
Most of the other social-threat questions followed a similar pattern2. On its surface, this might seem to suggest that authoritarianism is just a proxy for especially hard-line manifestations of social conservatism. But when examined more carefully, it suggests something more interesting about the nature of social conservatism itself.

For liberals, it may be easy to conclude that opposition to things like same-sex marriage, immigration, and diversity is rooted in bigotry against those groups ÃÂ that it's the manifestation of specific homophobia, xenophobia, and Islamophobia.

But the results of the Vox/Morning Consult poll, along with prior research on authoritarianism, suggests there might be something else going on.

There is no particular reason, after all, why parenting goals should coincide with animus against specific groups. We weren't asking questions about whether it was important for children to respect people of different races, but about whether they should respect authority and rules generally. So why do they coincide so heavily?

What might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenner's theory of ""activation""
What is most likely, Hetherington suggested, is that authoritarians are much more susceptible to messages that tell them to fear a specific ""other"" ÃÂ whether or not they have a preexisting animus against that group. Those fears would therefore change over time as events made different groups seem more or less threatening.

It all depends, he said, on whether a particular group of people has been made into an outgroup or not ÃÂ whether they had been identified as a dangerous other.

Since September 2001, some media outlets and politicians have painted Muslims as the other and as dangerous to America. Authoritarians, by nature, are more susceptible to these messages, and thus more likely to come to oppose the presence of mosques in their communities.

When told to fear a particular outgroup, Hetherington said, ""On average people who score low in authoritarianism will be like, 'IÃÂm not that worried about that,' while people who score high in authoritarianism will be like, 'Oh, my god! IÃÂm worried about that, because the world is a dangerous place.'""

In other words, what might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenner's theory of ""activation"": that authoritarians are unusually susceptible to messages about the ways outsiders and social changes threaten America, and so lash out at groups that are identified as objects of concern at that given moment.

That's not to say that such an attitude is in some way better than simple racism or xenophobia ÃÂ it is still dangerous and damaging, especially if it empowers frightening demagogues like Donald Trump.

Perhaps more to the point, it helps explain how Trump's supporters have come to so quickly embrace such extreme policies targeting these outgroups: mass deportation of millions of people, a ban on foreign Muslims visiting the US. When you think about those policy preferences as driven by authoritarianism, in which social threats are perceived as especially dangerous and as demanding extreme responses, rather than the sudden emergence of specific bigotries, this starts to make a lot more sense.

VIII. What authoritarians want
From our parenting questions, we learned who the GOP authoritarians are. From our questions about threats and social change, we learned what's motivating them. But the final set of questions, on policy preferences, might be the most important of all: So what? What do authoritarians actually want?

The responses to our policy questions showed that authoritarians have their own set of policy preferences, distinct from GOP orthodoxy. And those preferences mean that, in real and important ways, authoritarians are their own distinct constituency: effectively a new political party within the GOP.

What stands out from the results, Feldman wrote after reviewing our data, is that authoritarians ""are most willing to want to use force, to crack down on immigration, and limit civil liberties.""

This ""action side"" of authoritarianism, he believed, was the key thing that distinguished Trump supporters from supporters of other GOP candidates. ""The willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats ÃÂ that is most clear among Trump supporters.""

Authoritarians generally and Trump voters specifically, we found, were highly likely to support five policies:

Using military force over diplomacy against countries that threaten the United States
Changing the Constitution to bar citizenship for children of illegal immigrants
Imposing extra airport checks on passengers who appear to be of Middle Eastern descent in order to curb terrorism
Requiring all citizens to carry a national ID card at all times to show to a police officer on request, to curb terrorism
Allowing the federal government to scan all phone calls for calls to any number linked to terrorism
What these policies share in common is an outsize fear of threats, physical and social, and, more than that, a desire to meet those threats with severe government action ÃÂ with policies that are authoritarian not just in style but in actuality. The scale of the desired response is, in some ways, what most distinguishes authoritarians from the rest of the GOP.

""Many Republicans seem to be threatened by terrorism, violence, and cultural diversity, but that's not unique to Trump supporters,"" Feldman told me.

""It seems to be the action side of authoritarianism ÃÂ the willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats ÃÂ that is most clear among Trump supporters,"" he added.

If Trump loses the election, that won't remove the threats and social changes that trigger the ""action side"" of authoritarianism
This helps explain why the GOP has had such a hard time co-opting Trump's supporters, even though those supporters' immediate policy concerns, such as limiting immigration or protecting national security, line up with party orthodoxy. The real divide is over how far to go in responding. And the party establishment is simply unwilling to call for such explicitly authoritarian policies.

Just as striking is what was missing from authoritarians' concerns. There was no clear correlation between authoritarianism and support for tax cuts for people making more than $250,000 per year, for example. And the same was true of support for international trade agreements.

These are both issues associated with mainstream GOP economic policies. All groups opposed the tax cuts, and support for trade agreements was evenly lukewarm across all degrees of authoritarianism. So there is no real divide on these issues.

But there is one more factor that our data couldn't capture but is nevertheless important: Trump's style.

Trump's specific policies aren't the thing that most sets him apart from the rest of the field of GOP candidates. Rather, it's his rhetoric and style. The way he reduces everything to black-and-white extremes of strong versus weak, greatest versus worst. His simple, direct promises that he can solve problems that other politicians are too weak to manage.

And, perhaps most importantly, his willingness to flout all the conventions of civilized discourse when it comes to the minority groups that authoritarians find so threatening. That's why it's a benefit rather than a liability for Trump when he says Mexicans are rapists or speaks gleefully of massacring Muslims with pig-blood-tainted bullets: He is sending a signal to his authoritarian supporters that he won't let ""political correctness"" hold him back from attacking the outgroups they fear.

This, Feldman explained to me, is ""classic authoritarian leadership style: simple, powerful, and punitive.""

IX. How authoritarians will change the GOP ÃÂ and American politics

To my surprise, the most compelling conclusion to come out of our polling data wasn't about Trump at all.

Rather, it was that authoritarians, as a growing presence in the GOP, are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump ÃÂ and will persist as a force in American politics regardless of the fate of his candidacy.

If Trump loses the election, that will not remove the threats and social changes that trigger the ""action side"" of authoritarianism. The authoritarians will still be there. They will still look for candidates who will give them the strong, punitive leadership they desire.

And that means Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics, with potentially profound implications for the country.

It would also mean more problems for the GOP. This election is already showing that the party establishment abhors Trump and all he stands for ÃÂ his showy demagoguery, his disregard for core conservative economic values, his divisiveness.

We may now have a de facto three-party system: the Democrats, the GOP establishment, and the GOP authoritarians
But while the party may try to match Trump's authoritarian rhetoric, and its candidates may grudgingly embrace some of his harsher policies toward immigrants or Muslims, in the end a mainstream political party cannot fully commit to extreme authoritarian action the way Trump can.

That will be a problem for the party. Just look at where the Tea Party has left the Republican establishment. The Tea Party delivered the House to the GOP in 2010, but ultimately left the party in an unresolved civil war. Tea Party candidates have challenged moderates and centrists, leaving the GOP caucus divided and chaotic.

Now a similar divide is playing out at the presidential level, with results that are even more destructive for the Republican Party. Authoritarians may be a slight majority within the GOP, and thus able to force their will within the party, but they are too few and their views too unpopular to win a national election on their own.

And so the rise of authoritarianism as a force within American politics means we may now have a de facto three-party system: the Democrats, the GOP establishment, and the GOP authoritarians.

And although the latter two groups are presently forced into an awkward coalition, the GOP establishment has demonstrated a complete inability to regain control over the renegade authoritarians, and the authoritarians are actively opposed to the establishment's centrist goals and uninterested in its economic platform.

Over time, this will have significant political consequences for the Republican Party. It will become more difficult for Republican candidates to win the presidency because the candidates who can win the nomination by appealing to authoritarian primary voters will struggle to court mainstream voters in the general election. They will have less trouble with local and congressional elections, but that might just mean more legislative gridlock as the GOP caucus struggles to balance the demands of authoritarian and mainstream legislators. The authoritarian base will drag the party further to the right on social issues, and will simultaneously erode support for traditionally conservative economic policies.

And in the meantime, the forces activating American authoritarians seem likely to only grow stronger. Norms around gender, sexuality, and race will continue evolving. Movements like Black Lives Matter will continue chipping away at the country's legacy of institutionalized discrimination, pursuing the kind of social change and reordering of society that authoritarians find so threatening.

The chaos in the Middle East, which allows groups like ISIS to flourish and sends millions of refugees spilling into other countries, shows no sign of improving. Longer term, if current demographic trends continue, white Americans will cease to be a majority over the coming decades.

In the long run, this could mean a GOP that is even more hard-line on immigration and on policing, that is more outspoken about fearing Muslims and other minority groups, but also takes a softer line on traditional party economic issues like tax cuts. It will be a GOP that continues to perform well in congressional and local elections, but whose divisions leave the party caucus divided to the point of barely functioning, and perhaps eventually unable to win the White House.

For decades, the Republican Party has been winning over authoritarians by implicitly promising to stand firm against the tide of social change, and to be the party of force and power rather than the party of negotiation and compromise. But now it may be discovering that its strategy has worked too well ÃÂ and threatens to tear the party apart."	0
185	"President-elect Donald Trump has asked Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn to head his White House national economic council, a group that coordinates economic policy across agencies, NBC News reported on Friday.

If elected, Cohn would be the third Goldman alumni picked to serve in the Trump administration: Steven Mnuchin, nominated to head the treasury department, and Steve Bannon, picked to be White House chief strategist, are both ex-Goldman Sachs executives.

Cohn, 56, is president and chief operating officer at the Wall Street firm and had until recently been widely considered the heir apparent to chief executive Lloyd Blankfein. But according to the Wall Street Journal, Cohn, who met with Trump on Tuesday, has been considering a move in recent months.

Analysis Trump's billionaire cabinet could be the wealthiest administration ever
Opponents warn the administration is set to be packed with tycoons who will do nothing to fulfil his promise of helping working-class Americans
 
A Goldman Sachs spokesman was not immediately available for comment.

Cohn is a former Goldman commodities trader from Ohio who joined the firm in 1990. He served in a variety of leadership roles in bond trading, becoming co-head of GoldmanÃÂs broader securities and, eventually, co-president in 2006. He makes frequent appearances at industry conferences and on television, speaking on the state of the financial markets.

Cohn is a registered Democrat who has donated money to both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

If he takes the post, he will be following in the footsteps of Robert Rubin and Stephen Friedman, two other onetime Goldman Sachs executives who served in that role.

ÃÂWeÃÂre not going,ÃÂ she replied.

I am the son of Muslim immigrants. As I sent that text, in the aftermath of the horrible attack in Orlando, Fla., I realized how awful it was to tell an American citizen to be careful about how she worshiped.

Being Muslim American already carries a decent amount of baggage. In our culture, when people think ÃÂMuslim,ÃÂ the picture in their heads is not usually of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or the kid who left the boy band One Direction. ItÃÂs of a scary terrorist character from ÃÂHomelandÃÂ or some monster from the news.

Today, with the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and others like him spewing hate speech, prejudice is reaching new levels. ItÃÂs visceral, and scary, and it affects how people live, work and pray. It makes me afraid for my family. It also makes no sense.

There are approximately 3.3 million Muslim Americans. After the attack in Orlando, The Times reported that the F.B.I. is investigating 1,000 potential ÃÂhomegrown violent extremists,ÃÂ a majority of whom are most likely connected in some way to the Islamic State. If everyone on that list is Muslim American, that is 0.03 percent of the Muslim American population. If you round that number, it is 0 percent. The overwhelming number of Muslim Americans have as much in common with that monster in Orlando as any white person has with any of the white terrorists who shoot up movie theaters or schools or abortion clinics.

I asked a young friend of mine, a woman in her 20s of Muslim heritage, how she had been feeling after the attack. ÃÂI just feel really bad, like people think I have more in common with that idiot psychopath than I do the innocent people being killed,ÃÂ she said. ÃÂIÃÂm really sick of having to explain that IÃÂm not a terrorist every time the shooter is brown.ÃÂ

I myself am not a religious person, but after these attacks, anyone that even looks like they might be Muslim understands the feelings my friend described. There is a strange feeling that you must almost prove yourself worthy of feeling sad and scared like everyone else.

I understand that as far as these problems go, I have it better than most because of my recognizability as an actor. When someone on the street gives me a strange look, itÃÂs usually because they want to take a selfie with me, not that they think IÃÂm a terrorist.

But I remember how those encounters can feel. A few months after the attacks of Sept. 11, I remember walking home from class near N.Y.U., where I was a student. I was crossing the street and a man swore at me from his car window and yelled: ÃÂTerrorist!ÃÂ To be fair, I may have been too quick to cross the street as the light changed, but IÃÂm not sure that warranted being compared to the perpetrators of one of the most awful incidents in human history.

The vitriolic and hate-filled rhetoric coming from Mr. Trump isnÃÂt so far off from cursing at strangers from a car window. He has said that people in the American Muslim community ÃÂknow who the bad ones are,ÃÂ implying that millions of innocent people are somehow complicit in awful attacks. Not only is this wrongheaded; but it also does nothing to address the real problems posed by terrorist attacks. By Mr. TrumpÃÂs logic, after the huge financial crisis of 2007-08, the best way to protect the American economy would have been to ban white males.

According to reporting by Mother Jones, since 9/11, there have been 49 mass shootings in this country, and more than half of those were perpetrated by white males. I doubt weÃÂll hear Mr. Trump make a speech asking his fellow white males to tell authorities ÃÂwho the bad ones are,ÃÂ or call for restricting white malesÃÂ freedoms.

One way to decrease the risk of terrorism is clear: Keep military-grade weaponry out of the hands of mentally unstable people, those with a history of violence, and those on F.B.I. watch lists. But, despite sit-ins and filibusters, our lawmakers are failing us on this front and choose instead to side with the National Rifle Association. Suspected terrorists can buy assault rifles, but weÃÂre still carrying tiny bottles of shampoo to the airport. If weÃÂre going to use the ÃÂtheyÃÂll just find another wayÃÂ argument, letÃÂs use that to let us keep our shoes on.

Xenophobic rhetoric was central to Mr. TrumpÃÂs campaign long before the attack in Orlando. This is a guy who kicked off his presidential run by calling Mexicans ÃÂrapistsÃÂ who were ÃÂbringing drugsÃÂ to this country. Numerous times, he has said that Muslims in New Jersey were cheering in the streets on Sept. 11, 2001. This has been continually disproved, but he stands by it. I donÃÂt know what every Muslim American was doing that day, but I can tell you what my family was doing. I was studying at N.Y.U., and I lived near the World Trade Center. When the second plane hit, I was on the phone with my mother, who called to tell me to leave my dorm building.

The haunting sound of the second plane hitting the towers is forever ingrained in my head. My building was close enough that it shook upon impact. I was scared for my life as my fellow students and I trekked the panicked streets of Manhattan. My family, unable to reach me on my cellphone, was terrified about my safety as they watched the towers collapse. There was absolutely no cheering. Only sadness, horror and fear.

Mr. Trump, in response to the attack in Orlando, began a tweet with these words: ÃÂAppreciate the congrats.ÃÂ It appears that day he was the one who was celebrating after an attack.

187	"Park City, Utah (CNN)Mitt Romney suggested Friday that Donald Trump's election could legitimize racism and misogyny, ushering in a change in the moral fabric of American society.

The 2012 Republican nominee, who has openly opposed Trump's candidacy, went further than he has before in outlining to CNN's Wolf Blitzer how the country's character would suffer in a Trump White House. Trump's rhetoric has caused even some other Republicans to label him a racist, and Romney said he would not be able to paper over his incendiary remarks.
""I don't want to see trickle-down racism,"" Romney said in an interview here in a suite overlooking the Wasatch Mountains, where he is hosting his yearly ideas conference. ""I don't want to see a president of the United States saying things which change the character of the generations of Americans that are following. Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry, trickle-down misogyny, all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America.""
Romney retreat puts spotlight on Trump's fundraising problem in critical stretch
Trump, speaking at a rally in Richmond, Virginia, Friday night, didn't address Romney's criticism directly but did say, ""I am the least racist person, the least racist person that you've ever seen,"" a line he frequently says at campaign events.
By Saturday morning, Trump was directly responding to Romney, tweeting, ""Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is.""
 
Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is

He then added, ""Don King, and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!""
 
He kept up his attacks while speaking at a campaign rally on Saturday in Tampa, Florida, telling the crowd, ""I don't think he knows what a misogynist is. Don't forget this guy let us down."" He would later double down on the criticism at a campaign event in Pittsburgh.
Romney considering Johnson
Romney, who actively sought to recruit an independent, third-party challenger to Trump, also conceded that a credible candidate will not emerge. But he did show a new openness to one non-Trump candidate, libertarian Gary Johnson, whom he did not rule out voting for.
Johnson's running mate is another former Massachusetts governor, Bill Weld, who once fundraised for Romney. If the ticket was flipped and Weld was the standard-bearer, Romney said he would have no qualms about voting for the libertarian ticket this fall.
Hillary Clinton huddles with top fundraisers
""If Bill Weld were at the top of the ticket, it would be very easy for me to vote for Bill Weld for president,"" Romney said. ""So I'll get to know Gary Johnson better and see if he's someone who I could end up voting for. That's something which I'll evaluate over the coming weeks and months.""
Romney's comments on ""The Situation Room"" are some of the highest-profile support bestowed upon the libertarian ticket, which is almost certain to be less funded compared to the GOP and Democratic lines. He did however express an uneasiness with Johnson, given his position on marijuana legalization.
""Marijuana makes people stupid,"" Romney quipped.
Johnson said Saturday that others should join Romney in giving the Libertarian nominees a closer look.
""I think Mitt Romney hit it on the head. He said, 'Hey, I'm going to check out Gary Johnson and see what he's got to say,'"" he told CNN's Victor Blackwell on ""CNN Newsroom."" ""I think that kind of scrutiny holds up under the light of day.""

Romney once again ruled out running himself, but he was also candid about independent efforts to recruit a challenger. Several sought-after Republicans, including Ben Sasse and author David French, have taken passes.
Orrin Hatch explains friendship with Muhammad Ali
""I think you're not going to find a credible candidate actually running as a third-party contender,"" Romney said. ""The only way to win the White House, in my view, is to become a nominee of either the Republican or the Democrat Party, and simply running to be a spoiler would not give the American people I think the chance to express their own views about Mr. Trump or about Secretary Clinton.""
Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, appearing later on ""The Situation Room,"" dismissed Romney's criticism.
""This again is just sour grapes from the establishment who have had the power stripped out of theirs hands by a candidate that they do not like because he has managed to do something they have been unable to do for decades,"" Pierson said.
And Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted later Friday, ""Respect Mitt and differences but couldn't disagree more. SCOTUS too important to lose for generations. Let's stop this and unify.""
 
Respect Mitt and differences but couldn't disagree more. SCOTUS too important to lose for generations. Let's stop this and unify.

In Richmond, Trump alluded to his critics, though he didn't mention Romney by name.
Clinton donor received top spot on State Department intel board
""These poor people going, 'Never Trump, never Trump' -- they've been doing it for months. They did it with Indiana, they did it with New York -- 'We're going to win New York' -- and I won in a massive landslide.""
'My choice is different'
Romney again speculated about what might be in Trump's tax returns, which he has repeatedly declined to release, claiming that he's under audit. Asked what might be in there, Romney referred to a months-ago comment by Trump that he could not lose support even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York City.
""He's calculated that he could get support even if he shot someone, but if he released his taxes, he'd lose support,"" Romney said. ""So there's something in those taxes that's even worse than shooting someone on Fifth Avenue.""
Yet Romney declined to criticize other Republicans who have harbored similar feelings about Trump but endorsed him. Romney's mentee and vice-presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, has uneasily backed Trump, but Romney declined multiple chances to pass judgment on the speaker's decision.
""Are you disappointed Paul Ryan has endorsed him?"" Blitzer asked.
""I wish everybody in the Republican Party had rejected Mr. Trump and chosen someone else,"" Romney said. ""But my choice is different than that of the other people, and I'm certainly not going to argue with them about their choice.""
Sanders to meet with top supporters to discuss campaign's future
Romney also shared some disappointment in the Republican candidates who wooed him fervently for support, saying they largely shied away from a fight with Trump in the primary. For much of the campaign, Republican candidates squabbled to position themselves as the chief Trump alternative.
""I don't think he got the scrutiny applied to him that is typically applied to a front-runner by the people running against him,"" he said, lamenting that they were ""firing at each other."" ""Jeb Bush had a super PAC of over $100 million. And they focused their fire on Marco Rubio and others, as opposed to focusing it on the front-runner.""
But if Romney had ran?
""Had I been in the race,"" he said, ""I can assure you, I would have taken him on."""	0
188	"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) ÃÂ Donald Trump has broken all kinds of norms during his presidential campaign, but he just went to a whole new level this morning by tweeting what is supposedly an image of his private-parts. The tweet was quickly deleted but not before being retweeted over 5,000 times.

The tweet comes in response to comments made by Marco Rubio and others about the size of Donald TrumpÃÂs hands.

ÃÂLook at those hands, are they small hands?ÃÂ Trump told the audience at his rally in Detroit back in March. ÃÂAnd he [Rubio] referred to my hands, ÃÂif theyÃÂre small something else must be small.ÃÂ I guarantee you thereÃÂs no problem, I guarantee it.ÃÂ

Donald Trump's penis size
A screenshot of Donald TrumpÃÂs tweet captured by ABC News just minutes before it was deleted.
ÃÂHeÃÂs always calling me Little Marco. And IÃÂll admit heÃÂs taller than me,ÃÂ Rubio told ABC News. ÃÂHeÃÂs like 6ÃÂ2, which is why I donÃÂt understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5ÃÂ2,ÃÂ Rubio said in Virginia on Sunday. ÃÂAnd you know what they say about men with small hands? You canÃÂt trust them.ÃÂ

The New York billionaire has heard similar comments about his hands or, more precisely, his fingers, for years.

As Vanity FairÃÂs Graydon Carter recalled online last year: ÃÂJust to drive him a little bit crazy, I took to referring to him as a ÃÂshort-fingered vulgarianÃÂ in the pages of Spy magazine. That was more than a quarter of a century ago.ÃÂ

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she isnÃÂt surprised by TrumpÃÂs actions.

ÃÂDonald Trump is an ego-maniac, racist, bigot, who brings out the worst in the worst people,ÃÂ Bradley said. ÃÂWe get donations from poor people, the middle class and the upper class all the time. Since Donald Trump is the least charitable billionaire in the entire world, we expect no donations from that dick pic tweeting pervert anytime soon.ÃÂ

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told reporters that he agrees with TrumpÃÂs actions.

ÃÂIf everyone says you have a small penis, you donÃÂt keep it in your pants, you donÃÂt hide it; you prove them wrong! This is exactly what a real president should do! Praise Donald Trump! Praise Fappy!ÃÂ

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this about Donald Trump is accomplishing.

ÃÂYou have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy,ÃÂ Mikkleson said. ÃÂWe claim ÃÂto provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as wellÃÂ, but thatÃÂs just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thatÃÂs it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and IÃÂm only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.ÃÂ Mikkelson continues, ÃÂIt is common for us to rewrite a story weÃÂre debunking if we donÃÂt like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a personÃÂs name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,ÃÂ Mikkelson laughs. ÃÂAnd lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as ÃÂa clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false ÃÂnewsÃÂ storiesÃÂ. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We donÃÂt list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims; ItÃÂs just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, IÃÂd say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.ÃÂ

ABC News reached out to TrumpÃÂs campaign for comment about the x-rated tweet and at the time of this press release did not receive a response."	1
189	"A quick trip down memory lane causes a stumble over this gem from Obama. He was gearing up for his first run at the office of President and was spewing lies all over the American public.



ÃÂIÃÂll make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business is the peopleÃÂs business.ÃÂ

He is finally living up to that with less than a month left to his Presidency. He is not bothering to hide the dirty business he conducts, because he just doesnÃÂt care anymore. Recent months aside, everything that Obama pledged regarding transparency was smoke and mirrors.

Many are speculating that he will step up and stop talking about the Hillary email scandal and simply pardon her from any prosecution. It is in his best interest to do so. His attempts to marginalize the issue by nitpicking the statutory categories of ÃÂconfidential,ÃÂ ÃÂsecretÃÂ and ÃÂtop secretÃÂ by commenting that ÃÂthereÃÂs classified and then thereÃÂs classifiedÃÂ were not successful. He then took up the Clinton rhetoric of Russian spies. Since emails from the President to the unsecure Clinton email were found, it is likely that he will try and end the scandal while he still has the power to do so.

A reporter with first-hand knowledge sums up ObamaÃÂs ÃÂtransparentÃÂ government, ÃÂObama and his team criminalized reporting, becoming the most secretive White House since Richard Nixon.ÃÂ

A message on the White House website from Obama makes it clear he still maintains the illusion that his office upheld the pledge of transparency;

ÃÂMy Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government.  We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government.ÃÂ

Every action taken by Barack Hussein Obama was calculated. He knew, as did his advisors and supporters, that he was actively engaged in deception against the United States. David Axelrod was the Chief Strategist for both of ObamaÃÂs campaigns. He also served as Senior Adviser to the President until 2011.

He was positioned to not only witness the secrecy that Obama demanded but he was also part of it. After leaving the Obama administration, Axelrod began to hint that things were quite different if we only looked below the surface.

Some of his revelations regarding Obama continue to come as a shock to people who the President painted with the colors of truth.

Obama lied about his support FOR same-sex marriage before announcing his support for it in 2012. ÃÂYet if ObamaÃÂs views were ÃÂevolvingÃÂ publicly, they were fully evolved behind closed doors,ÃÂ Axelrod writes. ÃÂThe president was champing at the bit to announce his support for the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed.
Obama chewed out Maureen Dowd on the campaign plane during the 2008 campaign. ÃÂNo one got under BarackÃÂs skin more than Maureen ÃÂ He was patronizing and disrespectful.ÃÂ This is a direct contradiction to the calm, composed, Obama that Axelrod had helped to portray. He even lashed out at Axelrod.
ÃÂObama can have a short fuse, though he hides it from the public: The president called Axelrod a ÃÂmotherÃÂÃÂrÃÂ and stalked out of a meeting after his strategist criticized the presidentÃÂs debating techniques as Obama prepared for his 2012 debate with Republican nominee Mitt RomneyÃÂ says Axelrod.
While those incidents speak to ObamaÃÂs two-faced behavior, some of the secrecy of his administration can be summed up as simply lies;

Lie: Obama has told the world there has never been a better friend of Israel in the White House.

Truth: In September 2012, an Israeli newspaper reported that senior Obama Administration officials have told Tehran that Barack Obama does not intend to join Israel in any attack on IranÃÂs nuclear installations.

Lie: In May 2011, Obama said the fence between America and Mexico was ÃÂbasically complete.ÃÂ

Truth: The Department of Homeland Security admits just 36.3 miles or 5% of the border is fenced.

Lie: Obama lied and said abortions would not be publicly funded under Obamacare.

Truth: A March 2012 edict from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) unequivocally ruled Obamacare will use our tax dollars to fund abortion.

Ben Rhodes was ObamaÃÂs partner in crime when it comes to one of the biggest lies of the administration; the Iran nuclear treaty. Rhodes, ObamaÃÂs Deputy National Security Adviser, openly admitted his contempt for journalists, ÃÂAll these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus. Now they donÃÂt. They call us to explain to them whatÃÂs happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. ThatÃÂs a sea change. They literally know nothing.ÃÂ

He later admitted more to David Samuels, a writer profiling Rhodes for a New York Times Magazine cover story; ÃÂIn the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. We created an echo chamber. They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.ÃÂ Rhodes was obviously not ashamed to display his contempt.

Fast forward to the present day and the new level of corruption that Obama reached when dealing with journalist James Rosen. In 2006, Risen published ÃÂState of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration.ÃÂ Unsurprisingly, President Bush did not take kindly to the book and his administration turned the whole situation into an investigation of government whistleblowers.

Risen was subpoenaed to reveal his sources, something he vehemently refused to do. He speaks about the attempt by Presidents to try and spin these stories; ÃÂWell, they have gone after investigative reporting. They try to take, essentially, stories that they donÃÂt like, and try to find some classified information that might be part of that, and then turn it into a criminal leak investigation in which they say someone mishandled or disclosed classified information. As you know, you could do that with virtually any story in Washington.ÃÂ

Since then Risen has fought the Bush administration and then the Obama administration. In 2009, Obama took a rather unprecedented step of renewing a subpoena scheduled to expire that year. He was probably hoping nobody remembered that when in 2014 speech he told reporters; ÃÂHere, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.ÃÂ

In 2010, despite Risen keeping his sources confidential, the federal government indicted Jeffrey A. Sterling, a former CIA operative, with leaking the classified information to Risen. He continued his defiance, facing jail time, when the government ordered him to appear as a witness at the trial of Sterling.

Finally in January of 2015, after 7 years of uncertainty, the government decided not to call Risen in the trial. His fight for the truth had finally won.

Risen is a good example of how the Obama administration has fought the very ideas that he promised to uphold. It is very likely that we will see more insiders coming forward to open up about ObamaÃÂs years in the White House. The truth would be a refreshing change.

A supporter of Risen, Jerry Kammer, a former Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who now works at the Center for Immigration Studies, has this to say about President Obama;

ÃÂHe promised to be a different kind of president. But he has only suppressed efforts to disclose the governmentÃÂs misdeeds. His administration has been untransparent at so many levels.ÃÂ"	1
190	"Inishturk, an island off the main coast of Ireland, has now joined Canada in officially accepting Americans requesting political asylum from a Donald Trump presidency.

The island has been experiencing a population decline in recent years, and they decided to try to reach out to Americans seeking to flee our current political dystopia by offering a new place to live if the idea of Donald Trump and the Republicans following his lead are just too much.

Mary Heanue, InishturkÃÂs development officer, was quoted as saying:

IÃÂve heard there are quite a few people in America looking to move to Ireland and other countries if Donald Trump becomes president. IÃÂd like them to know that weÃÂd love to see them consider moving over here.

Our big concern is employment and trying to encourage families to move over here because the population is declining. The island featured on an Irish TV documentary last year which gave us great publicity and a good few extra bookings. But we ended up having a terrible summer and a lot of people canceled.

TheyÃÂd be given a huge welcome and theyÃÂd find this is a fantastic place to live and to bring up children. Their kids would probably get the best education anywhere in the country too, because the teacher to pupil ratio is nearly one-on-one.

Although winters can be hard and itÃÂs the kind of life that wouldnÃÂt necessarily suit everyone, theyÃÂd find it very peaceful here and theyÃÂd soon find out thereÃÂs nowhere as nice in the world on a summerÃÂs day than here.ÃÂ

The website IrishCentral.com also got in on the action recently, by publishing their own guide on moving to Ireland in case Donald Trump is elected.

The website describes the details, and realities, of moving to Ireland. It isnÃÂt particularly cheap and the financial restrictions on it might preclude some people from being able to take advantage of it.

However, there are some big things on the plus side. The gun laws are restrictive and you wonÃÂt see wannabe cowboys carrying handguns openly in Ireland ÃÂ a huge plus. They have strong social welfare and services, plus did I mention universal heathcare? Not exactly a terrible ideaÃÂ  They also do take some well-placed digs at our Republican problem, by making a few short jabs at the likes of Bill OÃÂReilly and Donald Trump in particular, by stressing that you request an absentee ballot so you can still vote against Donald Trump for a nice middle finger from across the pond.

More than likely, Trump will not get elected. However, it never hurts to have a backup plan, especially if you donÃÂt fit into one of the new state-approved ethnic groups (whites only) that will be one of the features of a possible Donald in the White House."	1
191	"New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly-found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence ÃÂto put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life,ÃÂ NYPD sources told True Pundit.

NYPD sources said ClintonÃÂs ÃÂcrewÃÂ also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders.

The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday.

But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to:

Money laundering
Child exploitation
Sex crimes with minors (children)
Perjury
Pay to play through Clinton Foundation
Obstruction of justice
Other felony crimes
NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the departmentÃÂs highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices.

ÃÂWhatÃÂs in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,ÃÂ the NYPD Chief said. ÃÂThere is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.ÃÂ

The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton.

ÃÂPeople are going to prison,ÃÂ he said.

Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders  are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said.

ÃÂIf they donÃÂt cooperate they are going to see long sentences,ÃÂ a federal law enforcement source said.

NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high-ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said.

Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for WeinerÃÂs cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge.

The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. EpsteinÃÂs island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries.

Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as EpsteinÃÂs guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.

Laptop Also Unveiled More Classified, Top Secret Breaches

According to other uncovered emails, Abedin and Clinton both sent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts including WeinerÃÂs unsecured campaign web site which is managed by Democratic political consultants in Washington D.C.

Weiner maintained little known email accounts that the couple shared on the website anthonyweiner.com. Weiner, a former seven-term Democratic Congressman from New York, primarily used that domain to campaign for Congress and for his failed mayoral bid of New York City.

At one point, FBI sources said, Abedin and ClintonÃÂs classified and top secret State Department documents and emails were stored in WeinerÃÂs email on a server shared with a dog grooming service and a western Canadian bicycle shop.

However, Weiner and Abedin, who is Hillary ClintonÃÂs closest personal aide, werenÃÂt the only people with access to the WeinerÃÂs email account. Potentially dozens of unknown individuals had access to AbedinÃÂs sensitive State Department emails that were stored in WeinerÃÂs email account, FBI sources confirmed.

FEC records show Weiner paid more than $92,000 of congressional campaign funds to Anne Lewis Strategies LLC to manage his email and web site. According to FBI sources, the D.C.-based political consulting firm has served as the official administrator of the anthonyweiner.com domain since 2010, the same time Abedin was working at the State Department. This means technically Weiner and AbedinÃÂs emails, including top secret State Department emails, could have been accessed, printed, discussed, leaked, or distributed by untold numbers of personnel at the Anne Lewis consulting firm because they can control where the website and it emails are pointed, FBI sources said.

According to FBI sources, the bureauÃÂs newly-minted probe into ClintonÃÂs use and handling of emails while she served as secretary of state, has also been broadened to include investigating new email-related revelations, including:

Abedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to WeinerÃÂs email
Abedin stored emails, containing government secrets, in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over 500,000 archived State Department emails.
Weiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the records
Abedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemail.com address to send/receive/store classified and top secret documents
A private consultant managed WeinerÃÂs site for the last six years, including three years when Clinton was secretary of state, and therefore, had full access to all emails as the domainÃÂs listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contacts.
Because WeinerÃÂs campaign website is managed by the third-party consultant and political email guru, FBI agents are burdened with the task of trying to decipher just how many people had access to WeinerÃÂs server and emails and who were these people. Or if the server was ever compromised by hackers, or other actors.

Abedin told FBI agents in an April interview that she didnÃÂt know how to consistently print documents or emails from her secure Dept. of State system. Instead, she would forward the sensitive emails to her yahoo, Clintonemail.com and her email linked to Weiner.

Abedin said, according to FBI documents, she would then access those email accounts via webmail from an unclassified computer system at the State Dept. and print the documents, many of which were classified and top secret, from the largely unprotected webmail portals.

Clinton did not have a computer in her office on Mahogany Row at the State Dept. so she was not able to read timely intelligence unless it was printed out for her, Abedin said. Abedin also said Clinton could not operate the secure State Dept. fax machine installed in her Chappaqua, NY home without assistance.

Perhaps more alarming, according to the FBIÃÂs 302 Report detailing its interview with Abedin, none of the multiple FBI agents and Justice Department officials who conducted the interview pressed Abedin to further detail the email address linked to Weiner. There was never a follow up, according to the 302 report.

But now, all that has changed, with the FBIÃÂs decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation and the husband and wife seeking immunity deals to testify against Clinton and other associates about the contents of the laptopÃÂs emails."	1
192	"SAN FRANCISCO, Ca. ÃÂ While speaking at the F8 developerÃÂs conference in San Francisco this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a groundbreaking addition to the popular social media platform that many in the tech industry believe has the potential to revolutionize the American electoral process.

ÃÂWeÃÂre doing something thatÃÂs never been done before,ÃÂ Zuckerberg declared. ÃÂBy allowing Americans to utilize Facebook to cast their vote in the upcoming presidential election from anywhere in the world using their desktop or mobile devices, weÃÂre eliminating the conditions for which voter suppression can be implemented.ÃÂ

In the days leading up to the presidential election, Facebook users will be able to log into their accounts and find the profiles of each candidate prominently displayed at the top of their News Feed. ÃÂUsers can then cast their vote by Liking their desired candidateÃÂs profile,ÃÂ Zuckerberg explained before adding, ÃÂItÃÂs that simple.ÃÂ

Kathryn Blair, a senior official with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ÃÂ the federal agency which oversees state and national elections ÃÂ said that FacebookÃÂs revolutionary new voting platform is projected to become a national standard by 2020. ÃÂWe aim to completely phase out the old-style paper ballots by 2018,ÃÂ Blair told CNNÃÂs Wolf Blitzer. ÃÂIn a very short time, all elections in the United States will be decided through Facebook.ÃÂ Ms. Blair later said the EAC is working with Facebook to reduce voter fraud by identifying and eliminating duplicate or otherwise fake accounts.

According to Zuckerberg, the upcoming U.S. presidential election is only the beginning for FacebookÃÂs innovative voting platform. ÃÂIn the not too distant future, Facebook will determine the outcome of elections all around the world. From the United Kingdom to Pakistan; to Ukraine, the Philippines and Israel,ÃÂ vowed Zuckerberg. ÃÂWherever democracy thrives, Facebook will be there.ÃÂ"	1
193	"Back when Hussein Obama first befouled the White House, many naive Americans still gave him the benefit of the doubt in both his honesty and his declaration that he was a Christian. HeÃÂs since been revealed as a pathological liar and as a racist white-hating Muslim agitator, but he was operating under a much more stealthy strategy which was moderately effective at masking his destructive goals at the time. WikiLeaks has since made some things much clearer.

There were those who knew what he was up to, but their silence had been purchased. One such individual was Preeta Bansal, who may or may not share ObamaÃÂs personal characteristics and goals but certainly did nothing to expose his. She was one of the first of innumerable foreigners to be given high positions within the Obama regime, being a naturalized Indian. Obama has frequently used those with the weakest of ties to traditional America as his agents of fundamental transformation and anti-white, anti-American prejudice.

673-bansal-obama-discrimination

As the WikiLeaks leaked Podesta email reveals, Bansal was engaged not only in racist employment discrimination, but religious discrimination against Christians in the recommendation and review process for potential new hires within the executive branch. ThatÃÂs the kind of thing that Loretta Lynch and her bulldog DOJ ÃÂCivil RightsÃÂ Deputy Vanita Gupta would be all over if it were to happen to a Muslim or non-white. Discriminating against whites and Christians is just ÃÂwho we areÃÂ under this racist America-hating Islamist.

One thing that is important to remember is that this compilation of Muslim and Asian candidates for preferential employment treatment would not have been prepared without it being specifically requested by the inner circle within the Obama administration. Race-based preference was to be given and discrimination against those who were not Muslim or Asian was to be engaged in. Being Arab alone wasnÃÂt enough to get you onto the good list. Bansal specifically states that Arab Americans who were not Muslims were not included.

She also acknowledges that she included high profile Muslims even though she believed they would not survive the vetting process due to the attention they would receive from bloggers. Two questions rise from that admission; what kind of people is she seeking that blogger revelations would sink their candidacy and why did she, knowing their background difficulties, still include them as potential recruits?

Subject: Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates

 

Here are the compiled lists of Asian American and Muslim American

candidates for top Administration jobs, sub-cabinet jobs, and outside

boards/agencies/policy committees. A couple things to note about the list

of Muslim American candidates:

 

1) In the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab

American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many

Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (of

outside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be Muslim

American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of

uncertain religion (esp. Christian).

 

2) There is only one candidate I thought was a viable one for a

Secretary-level job among the Muslim Americans. That said, on both lists,

there are some very senior people listed in the last category (for outside

boards/commissions) who conceivably could be considered for top jobs. The

very senior people I put on the last list tended not to be terribly

involved in politics or policy, or in the case of some Asian Americans,

had already served in the Clinton and even Carter Administrations and so I

thought we should seek new talent. But thereÃÂs no magic to some of the

placements. I think the lists are fairly exhaustive, but some of the

people may be moved to other categories.

 

3) High-profile Muslim Americans tend to be the subject of a fair amount

of blogger criticism, and so the individuals on this list would need to be

ESPECIALLY carefully vetted. I suspect some of the people I list would

not survive such a vet ÃÂ but I do personally know, at least in part,

virtually all of the candidates in the 1st two categories (but I know very

few of those listed for outside boards/commissions).

 

4) I listed the elected Muslim American democratic officials at the end

of the second category, but for various reasons, I didnÃÂt think any of

them would necessarily be suitable for an Administration appointment.

Nevertheless, I wanted to flag them for you in case you wanted to evaluate

them further."	1
194	"As debate about ObamacareÃÂs future moves from peopleÃÂs general, mostly partisan views of the Affordable Care Act to details and consequences of plans to repeal and replace the ACA, one of the biggest flash points is likely to be how people with pre-existing medical conditions are affected.

Across the U.S., people who have cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or other serious conditions will want to know whether they or their sick family members will be able to get and afford coverage in the future. Their partisan views about Obamacare are likely to quickly be supplanted by these more practical concerns. And a substantial number of people could be affected.

A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis to be released next week found that almost 30% of U.S. adults younger than 65 have health conditions that would have left them uninsurable in a pre-ACA world. Many more people have conditions with which they could still qualify for coverage before ACA protections took effectÃÂbut only at premiums they could not afford. Many people with conditions over which coverage could be declined before the ACA live in big red states (there are more than 4 million in Texas, for example) and in blue states (nearly 6 million in California). As the chart above shows, however, the 11 states with the largest shares of adults who have pre-existing conditions are all controlled by Republicans, and most are in the South. These states have higher rates of residents with conditions over which coverage was declined before the ACA, such as obesity and diabetes.

Still, even more Americans may feel that they have a stake in policies regarding pre-existing conditions. KaiserÃÂs monthly health tracking poll found in August that 53% of Americans said that they or a family member had a pre-existing condition after being read a definition of the term. Most people with pre-existing conditions are insured at any given time through employer plans or public programs such as Medicaid. Before the ACA, however, they would have been unable to get coverage again if they lost their insurance through a change in circumstances. Because so many people with a pre-existing condition have to worry about whether their circumstances might change someday, a much larger share of the public is likely to be interested in this issue than the number of people who stand to be affected immediately by policy changes.

President-elect Donald Trump has said that he wants to protect people who have pre-existing medical conditions. Details of Republican health-care plans are not yet known, but they are expected to involve establishing high-risk pools within states, among other measures. Without the plan details it is hard to say how strong protections will be.

Tens of millions of people with pre-existing medical conditions and the influential groups that represent them will be interested in details of legislative plans to change the ACA and how they might be affected. ItÃÂs sometimes said that this has become a post-factual world. But as health care moves from a campaign issue to the legislative agenda, people will want to know how changes would affect them, and details and facts will matter more again.

195	NEW YORKÃÂTelling several members of the investment bankÃÂs board of directors how they had to check her out whenever they get a chance, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein was overheard Monday describing to friends how incredible it is to see Hillary Clinton live. ÃÂYou can forget any recordings youÃÂve heard of Hillary, because they donÃÂt even compare to the experience of seeing her in person,ÃÂ said Blankfein, who excitedly recounted the first time he saw the Democratic presidential nominee in a small, intimate venue back in 2013, noting how he was instantly captivated by what he was hearing and found himself nodding along throughout the 90-minute solo performance. ÃÂHonestly, I wasnÃÂt a big fan of hers going in, but she definitely changed my mind when I heard her up there onstage. All her material was amazing. She does not disappoint.ÃÂ Blankfein then reportedly assured his friends that seeing Clinton in person was worth every cent of what it costs and that they wouldnÃÂt regret it at all.	0
196	"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂBy easing tensions with Cuba and now Iran, President Obama is ÃÂrecklessly squandering AmericaÃÂs precious supply of enemies,ÃÂ the leader of a conservative think tank said on Tuesday.

ÃÂOur adversarial relationships with Cuba and Iran took years of frostiness and saber-rattling to maintain,ÃÂ Harland Dorrinson, the executive director of the Washington-based Institute for Infinite Conflict, said. ÃÂThanks to the President, decades of well-crafted hostility have been thrown out the window.ÃÂ

According to Dorrinson, fears abound in conservative circles that the President might be ÃÂcapriciously casting about for other powder kegs to defuseÃÂ during his remaining time in office.

ÃÂIf his shameful record is any guide, heÃÂll probably try to disarm North Korea,ÃÂ Dorrinson said. ÃÂThatÃÂs the doomsday scenario.ÃÂ

Regardless of his future actions, ObamaÃÂs detente with Cuba and Iran will likely tarnish his legacy forever, Dorrinson said. ÃÂOn this PresidentÃÂs watch, America lost two of its most enduring foes,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂHeÃÂs going to have to live with that for the rest of his life.ÃÂ"	0

198	"ItÃÂs Billy BushÃÂs snickering that really gets to me. In the video from 2005, published Friday by The Washington Post, you can hear Mr. Bush (first cousin to George W.) wheezing ecstatically as Donald J. Trump brags, inadvertently into a hot mic, about sexually harassing and groping women. The pair, along with a passel of unidentified men, are on a bus en route to film an Access Hollywood segment with the actress Arianne Zucker.

Through the window of the bus, Mr. Bush seems to spot Ms. Zucker first, as she waits to greet them. ÃÂSheesh,ÃÂ he blurts, breathless, telling Mr. Trump how hot ÃÂyour girlÃÂ is. You can feel Mr. BushÃÂs giddiness, a contact high, at getting to join a more powerful man in the oldest and most sacred of male bonding exercises: objectifying women.

Mr. Trump spies Ms. Zucker too. ÃÂWhoa!ÃÂ

ÃÂYes!ÃÂ Mr. Bush grunts, Beavis-esque, ÃÂYes, the Donald has scored!ÃÂ

Of course, ÃÂthe DonaldÃÂ has not ÃÂscored.ÃÂ The Donald is on the NBC lot to shoot a guest appearance on ÃÂDays of Our LivesÃÂ at the behest of his employer to promote his reality show, ÃÂThe Apprentice,ÃÂ while ÃÂAccess HollywoodÃÂ produces an accompanying puff piece. This is work within work within work. Mr. Bush is at work. Mr. Trump is at work. Ms. Zucker is at work, and not only is she not Mr. TrumpÃÂs ÃÂgirl,ÃÂ she is a complete stranger who is also on camera and being paid to smile.

ÃÂI gotta use some Tic Tacs,ÃÂ Mr. Trump says, still inside the bus, ÃÂjust in case I start kissing her. You know IÃÂm automatically attracted to beautiful ÃÂ I just start kissing them, itÃÂs like a magnet. Just kiss. I donÃÂt even wait. And when youÃÂre a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.ÃÂ Mr. Bush and the bus toadies laugh.

You canÃÂt ÃÂdo anything,ÃÂ actually. This might be a challenging concept for someone running a campaign so socially retrograde itÃÂs practically medieval, but women are allowed to own property now. That includes our own bodies, whether you feel ÃÂautomaticallyÃÂ entitled to pieces of us or not.

Every woman knows a version of Donald Trump. Most of us have known more of them than we can (or care to) recall. HeÃÂs the boss who thinks you owe him something; the date who thinks that silence means ÃÂyesÃÂ and ÃÂnoÃÂ means ÃÂtry harderÃÂ; the stranger who thinks your bodyÃÂs mere existence constitutes an invitation to touch, take, own and destroy. HeÃÂs every deadbeat hookup, every narcissistic loser, every man whoÃÂs ever tried to leverage power, money, fame, credibility or physical strength to snap your boundaries like matchsticks. He is hot fear and cold dread and a pit in your stomach. HeÃÂs the man who held you back, who never took you seriously, who treated you like nothing until you started to believe it, who raped you and told you it was your fault and whose daddy was a cop so who would believe you anyway?

Come on, women. You know this man. I can name the ones in my past ÃÂ name yours and imagine each as president, with every womanÃÂs life in his care. Would you even trust him to watch your dog? (ThatÃÂs a trick question because he would never do it. His defining characteristic is that he does not care about you.)

When Mr. Trump tells Mr. Bush that heÃÂs ÃÂgotta use a Tic TacÃÂ just in case he cannot restrain himself from non-consensually affixing his perfectly round, gasping lamprey mouth over Ms. ZuckerÃÂs, he is talking about sexually assaulting a co-worker.

When he says he grabs womenÃÂs genitals, he is talking about sexually assaulting anyone he feels like, at any time. Female Trump voters: ItÃÂs fine if youÃÂve come to terms with not being a full human being in the eyes of your party, but what about your daughters? Is that the life you want for them? You want old men to grab their genitals? You want the president of the United States to go around grabbing genitals?

Mr. Trump is rape cultureÃÂs blathering id, and Sunday night Hillary Clinton (who, no doubt, has just as many man-made scars as the rest of us) has to stand next to him on a stage, and remain unflappable as sheÃÂs held to an astronomically higher standard, and pretend that he is her equal while his followers persist in howling that sexism is a feminist myth. While Mr. Trump boasts about sexual assault and vows to suppress disobedient media, cable news pundits spend their time taking a protractor to Mrs. ClintonÃÂs smile ÃÂ a constant, churning, microanalysis of nothing.

Many people, well, many men, are expressing their disgust with Mr. Trump the only way they know how: By invoking their mothers and daughters and sisters ÃÂ people, presumably, with the anatomy Mr. Trump feels free to assess and knead. Hillary Clinton has been showing us all year, and all her life, that, sure, women can be cherished if you want, but they also can be president.

Meanwhile, right-wing lawmakers are scrambling, sanctimonious and pathetic, to distance themselves from their own hideous progeny, clearly hoping to salvage some personal credibility and perhaps even save their party. But here is the thing, the big thing, that Paul D. Ryan and Reince Priebus and Mike Pence and all the spineless Billy Bushes of the world (and plenty of progressive men too, for that matter) donÃÂt understand: Most of you are no better than Mr. Trump; you are just more subtle.

If you have spent your career brutalizing and dehumanizing women legislatively rather than personally, you are no better. If you were happy to overlook months of violent racism, xenophobia, transphobia and Islamophobia from the Trump campaign, but now youÃÂre mad that he used a bad word and tried to sleep with another manÃÂs wife, you are no better. If you have derided and stigmatized identity politics in an effort to keep the marginalized from organizing, you are no better. If you snicker or say nothing while your fellow men behave like Donald Trump, you are no better.

The truth is that all of you have failed women for generations, and you deserve to lose our votes. Next month we will grab you where it hurts. By your ballots."	0
199	"After hearing about 200 Marines left stranded after returning home from Operation Desert Storm back in 1991, Donald J.Trump came to the aid of those Marines by sending one of his planes to Camp Lejuene, North Carolina to transport them back home to their families in Miami, Florida.

Corporal Ryan Stickney was amongst the group that was stuck in North Carolina and could not make their way back to their homes. Stickey told Hannity.com that he had spent nearly six months serving in Operation Desert Storm between 1990 and 1991 and was eagerly awaiting his return home. 

Here is a picture from that day:

plane_photo_w_watermark_0_1463649006

Stickney spent the next few weeks after returning from Saudi Arabia in North Carolina at Camp Lejuene to wind down. Stickney and the 200 Marines were set to return home until an error had been made in the logistics unit and a plane wouldnÃÂt be able to take the Marines home on the date they were set to arrive.

Trump managed to get word of the situation and decided to send a plane to help the stranded Marines.

ÃÂThe way the story was told to us was that Mr. Trump found out about it and sent the airline down to take care of us. And thatÃÂs all we knewÃÂ.I remember asking ÃÂWho is Donald Trump?ÃÂ I truly didnÃÂt know anything about him,ÃÂ Stickney said.

Stickeny says that he and his family is forever grateful for lending a hand. His father, a former Eastern Airlines captain and Korean War veteran, even offered Trump a free ride as a way to say thank you for his kind services.

Thanks to Donald Trump, 200 Marines were able to see their families that day."	1
200	"Just before the presidential election there seemed to be a new woman coming forward every day claiming to have been sexually harassed by The Donald Trump.

It could also be that there isnÃÂt much merit to such claims of abuse. Trump has been in the public eye for long time  ÃÂ and yet every single one of his accusers waited until within one month of a national election to come forward? TheyÃÂre all aware of how wealthy the man is, and couldÃÂve come forward years (or in some cases, decades) ago and walked away with nice settlements if their claims were true. The fact that they didnÃÂt bother to do so gives me the impression that theyÃÂre looking for attention ÃÂ or to sway the election.

Summer Zervos the Ex-Apprentice loser who claimed Donald Trump sexually assaulted her was paid $500,000 by lawyer Gloria Allred to fabricate the story. Allred is a Hillary Clinton collaborator and DNC Assosciate. According to an anonymous source this deal was reportedly shopped around to other ex-Apprentice contestants, which makes sense now.

Everyday for about a week we saw one accuser after another come forth. We must share this to as many people as we can to vindicate Donald Trump.  ZervosÃÂ sexual harassment accusation against Trump is a ÃÂcompletely fabricated hoax.ÃÂ Zervos was paid half a million dollars by Gloria Allred, which is being paid out ÃÂslowly over timeÃÂ .

 Zervos was a big league Trump supporter who converted her whole family to the Trump Train until she met Gloria Allred, as was reported before. Money talks!"	1
201	"Donald Trump is responding to Bill ClintonÃÂs statement in a very presidential way, giving the American people the truth as opposed to the DemocratsÃÂ lies.

Bill Clinton stated that Trump knows how to get ÃÂangry, white menÃÂ to vote for him, and Trump responded by saying that Hillary ClintonÃÂs campaign focused too much on the wrong states, as per Fox News.

HillaryÃÂs husband and the rest of the Democrats are pointing fingers everywhere except for at Hillary Clinton, who deserves it.

The fact of the matter is that she ran a terrible campaign, and thatÃÂs why she lost. You would think she would have done so much better, due to the fact that this wasnÃÂt her first rodeo, but it bombed. It was DOA. Dead. On. Arrival.

Regarding BillÃÂs statement that Trump called him after the election, Trump clarified that it was Bill Clinton who called him and offered a very nice congratulations. Donald Trump was elected because he ran a very successful, if unconventional, campaign.

It was because of its unconventionality that it was so successful. The Trump campaign was a breath of fresh air to the American people, who were tired of the same old rickety career politicians who are dusted off and paraded around for the people to see.

HillaryÃÂs campaign did focus on the wrong states and barely made any appearances. Donald Trump hopped from state to state, practically killing himself to make several appearances and running himself ragged to prove to the people he was their best choice.

She failed to focus on states like Arkansas and states in the Midwest. She probably viewed them as ÃÂbeneath herÃÂ and not worth her precious time. She was so sure that she was going to win that she didnÃÂt even bother trying to sell herself in enough states.

The Clintons lost because of her and her campaignÃÂs mistakes, but who do they blame? They blame people like FBI Director Comey for reopening the investigation into HillaryÃÂs email scandal 11 days before the election, which did hurt her numbers.

But frankly, if youÃÂre going to complain about that, then try not performing illicit actions with government property and maybe you wonÃÂt be in the situation in the first place. ItÃÂs as simple as that, but the Democrats refuse to not think of themselves as victims.

Donald TrumpÃÂs response to Bill Clinton was absolutely perfect, and even more so because he put it on Twitter and sent it directly to the American people. Trump doesnÃÂt wait for the mainstream media to twist his wordsÃÂhe delivers them himself.

Trump is our president-elect, and he was confirmed as the next president by the Electoral College on Monday. So, all the effort that liberals put forth to prevent this was for nothingÃÂthey have, once again, failed. They can point fingers all they want and play the blame game, but it wonÃÂt change the outcome that Trump is the president, and Hillary Clinton is not."	1
202	"It came together in about a week. First, the idea for a punchy, uplifting dance video that would tell a story about diversity, difference and communal support. Then, 170 dancers, a few hours of rehearsalsÃÂand pantsuits. Lots of pantsuits.

The result: the #Pantsuitpower Flashmob for Hillary dance video, performed at New YorkÃÂs Union Square. ItÃÂs gotten nearly 2 million views on Facebook in a matter of days.



The video, accompanied by Justin TimberlakeÃÂs contagiously boppy disco-pop song ÃÂCanÃÂt Stop the Feeling,ÃÂ was posted on Facebook and Vimeo this week by Humanity for Hillary, a social media campaign aimed at artists, in support of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

ÃÂI wanted to bring some kind of humanity to her campaign, because I think humanity and love and humor tend to get lost when weÃÂre in the heat of all of this,ÃÂ says Celia Rowlson-Hall, 32, a New York-based choreographer whoÃÂs worked on HBOÃÂs ÃÂGirlsÃÂ and other TV shows and music videos. She and her Washington, D.C.-based friend, hiphop choreographer Crishon Landers, created the pantsuit dance, and Rowlson-Hall directed the video with her partner, Mia Lidofsky, an independent film producer. The couple met on the set of ÃÂGirls.ÃÂ

ÃÂWe just felt the need to do something,ÃÂ Rowlson-Hall says. ÃÂWe thought, how can we creatively impact this election? So we made the video.ÃÂ

ThereÃÂs nothing like dance to convey enthusiasm and energy, so itÃÂs a natural political tool. The fact that itÃÂs rarely used to rally votersÃÂand even more rarely used so wellÃÂis what makes this video feel so fresh. That, and the clarity of the choreography, the invigorating spirit and skill of the videoÃÂs massive chorus line, and the catchy tune.

[In a departure from negative TV ads, Clinton airs a spot featuring home videos of children.]

A graduate of North Carolina School of the Arts, Rowlson-Hall has worked in the New York dance scene for the past decade, first performing with a couple of troupes, and more recently choreographing for stage, film and television. She made her feature-film directorial debut with ÃÂMa,ÃÂ writing the wordless script, choreographing it and starring in it; it became a favorite of the 2015 American Film Institute Festival. She and Landers choreographed the flashmob scene in about four hours, she says, using simple, clear moves drawn from hiphop, ballet and modern dance. Each bears a message: Raised fists signify #BlackLivesMatter, arms and faces tilted to the sky hint at solar energy, circling hips symbolize reproductive rights. In the quietest and most emotional moment, dancers take a knee to evoke San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin KaepernickÃÂs national anthem protest against police brutality. Others stand with a hand on their hearts.

ÃÂThis is our right as a democracy to protest or honor the flag as we see fit,ÃÂ says Rowlson-Hall. 

She put the word out on Instagram and Facebook seeking dancers. She videotaped herself dancing the steps, and texted it to the dancers whoÃÂd replied. Many are professionals. A few came from BroadwayÃÂs ÃÂFiddler on the RoofÃÂ and the Martha Graham Dance Company. Some came from as far away as Toronto. Assorted ÃÂdance enthusiastsÃÂ joined inÃÂdentists, other artists and little girls fresh from soccer practice. They had a couple days to learn the moves on their own, then they met in small groups for one-hour sessions with the choreographers. ThatÃÂs when they were also fitted for their pantsuits, an homage to ClintonÃÂs go-to workwear. A few suits were donated by Topshop. Stylists scoured thrift stores for the rest.

Near the end you can glimpse the slender, short-haired Rowlson-Hall grooving in a pinstriped suit, her T-shirt emblazoned with ÃÂThe Future is Female.ÃÂ

For all the ebullient energy of the dancing, the video also produced some headaches. The directors didnÃÂt have a permit to use Union Square for their shoot.

ÃÂWe were terrified weÃÂd get shut down by the cops,ÃÂ says Lidofsky. They also feared pushback from Timberlake. They reached out to his manager about using his song, Lidofsky adds, but with no reply they plowed ahead, hoping Timberlake wouldnÃÂt mind. (No word from him yet.)

The only time the whole group rehearsed together was 20 minutes before the taping last Sunday morning, Oct 2.

ÃÂThe dancers came knowing the choreography to a T. IÃÂve never seen dancers work like that,ÃÂ says Rowlson-Hall. ÃÂIt was a whirlwind.ÃÂ

Clinton has some appreciation for dance: Her daughter, Chelsea, was a Washington School of Ballet student during Bill ClintonÃÂs presidency. So far, however, Hillary Clinton has been silent about the pantsuit dance.

ÃÂBut weÃÂre refreshing our email every single minute,ÃÂ Lidofsky says with a laugh. ÃÂWe really hope she saw this, and felt the love.ÃÂ"	0
203	"On Monday, Donald Trump held a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he merrily repeated a woman in the crowd who called Ted Cruz a pussy. Twenty-four hours later, Donald Trump won the New Hampshire primary in a landslide.

I'm not here to clutch my pearls over Trump's vulgarity; what was telling, rather, was the immaturity of the moment, the glee Trump took in his ""she said it, I didn't"" game. The media, which has grown used to covering Trump as a sideshow, delighted in the moment along with him ÃÂ it was funny, and it meant clicks, takes, traffic. But it was more than that. It was the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president showing off the demagogue's instinct for amplifying the angriest voice in the mob.

It is undeniably enjoyable to watch Trump. He's red-faced, discursive, funny, angry, strange, unpredictable, and real. He speaks without filter and tweets with reckless abandon. The Donald Trump phenomenon is a riotous union of candidate ego and voter id. America's most skilled political entertainer is putting on the greatest show we've ever seen.

It's so fun to watch that it's easy to lose sight of how terrifying it really is.

Trump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory. He pairs terrible ideas with an alarming temperament; he's a racist, a sexist, and a demagogue, but he's also a narcissist, a bully, and a dilettante. He lies so constantly and so fluently that it's hard to know if he even realizes he's lying. He delights in schoolyard taunts and luxuriates in backlash.

Donald Trump Campaigns Across New Hampshire Ahead Of Primary Day

Trump is in serious contention to win the Republican presidential nomination. His triumph in a general election is unlikely, but it is far from impossible. He's not a joke and he's not a clown. He's a man who could soon be making decisions of war and peace, who would decide which regulations are enforced and which are lifted, who would be responsible for nominating Supreme Court justices and representing America in the community of nations. This is not political entertainment. This is politics.

Trump's path to power has been unnerving. His business is licensing out his own name as a symbol of opulence. He has endured bankruptcies and scandal by bragging his way out of them. He rose to prominence in the Republican Party as a leader of the birther movement. He climbed to the top of the polls in this election by calling Mexicans rapists and killers. He defended a poor debate performance by accusing Megyn Kelly of being on her period. He responded to rival Ted Cruz's surge by calling for a travel ban on Muslims. When two of his supporters attacked a homeless man and said they did it because ""Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,"" he brushed off complaints that he's inspiring violence by saying his supporters are ""very passionate.""

Behind Trump's success is an unerring instinct for harnessing anger, resentment, and fear. His view of the economy is entirely zero-sum ÃÂ for Americans to win, others must lose. ""We're going to make America great again,"" he said in his New Hampshire victory speech, ""but we're going to do it the old-fashioned way. We're going to beat China, Japan, beat Mexico at trade. We're going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis. It's not going to happen anymore.""

Trump answers America's rage with more rage. As the journalist Molly Ball observed, ""All the other candidates say 'Americans are angry, and I understand.' Trump says, 'IÃÂM angry.'"" Trump doesn't offer solutions so much as he offers villains. His message isn't so much that he'll help you as he'll hurt them.

Donald Trump Holds New Hampshire Primary Night Gathering In Manchester

Trump's other gift ÃÂ the one that gets less attention but is perhaps more important ÃÂ is his complete lack of shame. It's easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics. But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery. Most people feel shame when they're exposed as liars, when they're seen as uninformed, when their behavior is thought cruel, when respected figures in their party condemn their actions, when experts dismiss their proposals, when they are mocked and booed and protested.

Trump doesn't. He has the reality television star's ability to operate entirely without shame, and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint. It is the single scariest facet of his personality. It is the one that allows him to go where others won't, to say what others can't, to do what others wouldn't.

Trump lives by the reality television trope that he's not here to make friends. But the reason reality television villains always say they're not there to make friends is because it sets them apart, makes them unpredictable and fun to watch. ""I'm not here to make friends"" is another way of saying, ""I'm not bound by the social conventions of normal people."" The rest of us are here to make friends, and it makes us boring, gentle, kind.

This, more than his ideology, is why Trump genuinely scares me. There are places where I think his instincts are an improvement on the Republican field. He seems more dovish than neoconservatives like Marco Rubio, and less dismissive of the social safety net than libertarians like Rand Paul. But those candidates are checked by institutions and incentives that hold no sway over Trump; his temperament is so immature, his narcissism so clear, his political base so unique, his reactions so strange, that I honestly have no idea what he would do ÃÂ or what he wouldn't do.

When MSNBC's Joe Scarborough asked Trump about his affection for Vladimir Putin, who ""kills journalists, political opponents and invades countries,"" Trump replied, ""He's running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country."" Later, he clarified that he doesn't actually condone killing journalists, but, he warned the crowd, ""I do hate them.""

It's a lie that if you put a frog into a pot of water and slowly turn up the heat the frog will simply boil, but it's a fact that if you put the American political system in a room with Trump for long enough we slowly lose track of how noxious he is, or we at least run out of ways to keep repeating it.

But tonight is a night to repeat it. There is something scary in Donald Trump. We should fear his rise."	0
204	"The Obama administration refuses to even utter the words ÃÂradical Islamic terrorismÃÂ, so itÃÂs no surprise that they have refused to call the murders of Christians by ISIS ÃÂgenocideÃÂ, but thatÃÂs exactly what it is. ISIS is literally trying to totally eliminate entire populations of people who do not believe the way they do.

When the House votes 383-0 against Obama, you know there is something majorly wrong with the mentality of the White House.

From Fox News:

The House approved a resolution Monday that declares the Islamic State is committing genocide against Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East ÃÂ putting even more pressure on the Obama administration to do the same ahead of a deadline later this week.

The resolution passed the House with a unanimous vote of 383-0.

The resolution came to a vote just days after the release of a graphic new report by the Knights of Columbus and In Defense of Christians on ISISÃÂ atrocities. The report made the case that the terror campaign against Christians and other minorities in Syria, Iraq and other parts of the Middle East is, in fact, genocide.

ÃÂWhen ISIS systematically targets Christians, Yezidis, and other ethnic and religious minorities for extermination, this is not only a grave injusticeÃÂit is a threat to civilization itself,ÃÂ Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., said in a statement. ÃÂWe must call the violence by its proper name: genocide.ÃÂ

The resolution was voted on ahead of a congressionally mandated March 17 deadline for Secretary of State John Kerry and the White House to make a decision on whether to make such a declaration. The measure is an effort to force the administrationÃÂs hand on the issue, as the administration has so far declined to take an official position.

There is a similar measure in the Senate that has yet to be voted on.

Obama may want to protect Islam and disregard Christians, but it is abundantly clear there are hundreds of leaders in the House and Senate who do not agree with ObamaÃÂs notions.

If the resolution passes the Senate at a similar margin as the house, it will solidify the level of embarrassment our country feels toward Obama."	1
205	"(NaturalNews) If a thug points a gun to your head, hands you a piece of paper, and says, ÃÂSign this contract,ÃÂ is the contract legally binding?

Of course it isnÃÂt. It was coerced under the threat of violence, and no court in the nation would uphold the contract as legally binding.

Yet right now, electoral voters all across America are being essentially held at gunpoint, threatened with being killed if they donÃÂt change their votes to oppose Donald Trump. The dishonest mainstream media is further amplifying the coercion by running an organized psyop campaign of disinfo (ÃÂpsyopÃÂ means psychological operations) which falsely claims the Russians ÃÂhackedÃÂ the election, despite the complete absence of a shred of evidence to support the narrative.

The Russian hack conspiracy delusion has already been completely discredited. It turns out the DNC emails were leaked by a democrat insider who supported Bernie Sanders. The handing over of the emails took place in a wooded area in Washington D.C. and had nothing whatsoever to do with the Russians.

ÃÂElectors around the country are being harassed with a barrage of emails, phone calls and letters ÃÂ and even death threats ÃÂ in an effort to block Donald Trump from being voted in as president by the Electoral College on Monday,ÃÂ reports the NY Post today.

The NY Post also reports:

Reports of GOP electors being badgered have been reported in numerous states, including Georgia, Idaho, Tennessee, Arizona, Utah and Michigan.

For Michael Banerian, a senior at Oakland University in Michigan and a Republican elector, the harassment comes with a dark side.

He said heÃÂs been getting death threats via email, snail mail, Twitter and Facebook.

ÃÂSomebody threatened to put a bullet in the back of my mouth,ÃÂ Banerian, 22, told The Post on Wednesday.

Leftists are ÃÂkidnappingÃÂ electoral voters and holding them for ransom

What you may not know is that these death threats are a coordinated campaign to threaten electoral voters into throwing the election. Yet the very existence of such persistent, coordinated death threats means that We the People must correct the electoral votes, knowing that many such votes will be cast under the threat of being killed. Thus, electoral votes cast under threat or violence are not legally binding. They may be ÃÂreclaimedÃÂ by the courts and corrected to represent the will of the voters in their states.

In essence, the political left ÃÂ organized by international terrorist money man George Soros and people with ties to both the White House and Hillary Clinton ÃÂ has ÃÂpsychologically kidnappedÃÂ the electoral voters, and theyÃÂre demanding a kind of ÃÂransomÃÂ or they will be killed. That ransom is a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump.

In other words, this is a ÃÂpolitical muggingÃÂ where the radical left is holding a gun to their heads and saying, ÃÂYour vote or your life.ÃÂ

And if they manage to switch 37 electoral votes through such death threats, the left will declare a ÃÂvictoryÃÂ for America, proclaiming the very people they threatened with being killed as being ÃÂheroesÃÂ for saving the country.

Unbelievable, isnÃÂt it? This is right out of the Kim Jong-Un playbook for how to run a brutal dictatorship, which is probably why the radical left loves it so much. If you do what they want, youÃÂre heralded as a national hero. If you donÃÂt do what they want, you get a bullet in the head.

This really is the way liberals exert power, by the way, which is precisely why the DNC leaks happened in the first place: Some Bernie Sanders supporters were so angry at the Clinton collusion and corruption, they decided to expose the DNC by handing over leaked emails to Wikileaks. The democrats only have themselves to blame for losing the election because the truth came out.

Lawless democrats have no respect for real democracyÃÂ theyÃÂre pushing America toward a civil war they will quickly lose

What these tactics reveal is how lawless democrats have no respect whatsoever for the laws of this nation. Acting as crybullies and domestic terrorists, if they donÃÂt get their way, they threaten to shoot everybody who disagrees with them. (Sound familiar? Look up the history of ChinaÃÂs ÃÂCultural Revolution.ÃÂ)

ThatÃÂs the kind of behavior we see from totalitarian dictators in places like Cuba, North Korea or Communist China. And itÃÂs perfectly aligned with the tyrannical philosophy of the political left: If they donÃÂt get their way, they threaten to kill everyone who opposes them.

IÃÂve got news for those who espouse such threats of violence, coercion and lawlessness: We the People will stop you by invoking the Second Amendment to protect the Republic. And after we stop you, we will imprison you and charge you with crimes of treason. From there, the courts can decide what punishment is appropriate for your crimes.

Once President Trump is sworn into office, I hope he unleashes a massive investigation into all those who made death threats against the electoral voters. Those individuals must be arrested, imprisoned and charged with serious felony crimes, including sedition. Putting a gun to the heads of electoral voters is a very serious thing. It threatens the sanctity of the entire Republic. Such threats cannot go unpunished.

Hey, we can finally put all those FEMA camps to good use!

In observing all this, IÃÂve come to realize the radical left is going to push America into a civil war. But I also believe a civil war wonÃÂt last very long because the left will be very quickly defeated by a combination of police, military and armed American patriots fighting alongside law enforcement.

It turns out all those FEMA camps will come in handy after all: ThatÃÂs where we can put all the left-wing terrorists and traitors who tried (but failed) to overthrow the country. There, weÃÂll pump in broadcasts of Sean Hannity and Michael Savage until we break the NLP hypnosis programming the left-wingers have been subjected to for the last eight years under Obama, a master of linguistic subterfuge.

Over time, some of them might be rehabilitated to the point where they can rejoin society as sane, rational citizens instead of the mentally ill crybullies they are today. After all, we want to help these people heal their mental illness wherever possible. Unlike the radical left which wants to kill everyone they donÃÂt agree with, conservative Americans are far more interested in saving lives and uplifting our fellow brothers and sisters, no matter what sort of psychological trauma they were subjected to by CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times.

Remember: The same kind of psyop the media is running right now against the electoral voters has been pursued for years against liberals and progressives. ThatÃÂs why they are so traumatized by reality: TheyÃÂve been poisoned, programmed, hypnotized and traumatized by the left-wing media for as long as they can remember!

ItÃÂs time to finally set all Americans free from the psychological prisons that have been built for them by the corrupt political left. That effort begins anew on January 20, 2017, which is precisely why the radical left is planning to stage a mass uprising on that day. They last thing the left wants is Americans who arenÃÂt subjected to a daily dose of left-wing propaganda.

Stay tuned to NaturalNews.com and NewsTarget.com for more details as all this moves forward. IÃÂm also launching a new live broadcast show in 2017 to cover breaking news in real time."	1
206	"ThereÃÂs no telling how many times during the campaign Hillary Clinton has brought up AmericaÃÂs nuclear codes, and how important it is that someone whoÃÂs riled by a tweet never be allowed anywhere near them.

She also repeated on #DebateNight the established Democrat talking point that the contents of the documents posted by WikiLeaks arenÃÂt nearly as important as the fact that Russia is hacking our servers ÃÂ a threat so severe that she decided to set up her own private email server in her house.

207	"A review of FBI Director James ComeyÃÂs professional history and relationships shows that the Obama cabinet leader ÃÂ now under fire for his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton ÃÂ is deeply entrenched in the big-money cronyism culture of Washington, D.C. His personal and professional relationships ÃÂ all undisclosed as he announced the Bureau would not prosecute Clinton ÃÂ reinforce bipartisan concerns that he may have politicized the criminal probe.

These concerns focus on millions of dollars that Comey accepted from a Clinton Foundation defense contractor, ComeyÃÂs former membership on a Clinton Foundation corporate partnerÃÂs board, and his surprising financial relationship with his brother Peter Comey, who works at the law firm that does the Clinton FoundationÃÂs taxes.

Lockheed Martin

When President Obama nominated Comey to become FBI director in 2013, Comey promised the United States Senate that he would recuse himself on all cases involving former employers.

But Comey earned $6 million in one year alone from Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin became a Clinton Foundation donor that very year.

Comey served as deputy attorney general under John Ashcroft for two years of the Bush administration. When he left the Bush administration, he went directly to Lockheed Martin and became vice president, acting as a general counsel.

How much money did James Comey make from Lockheed Martin in his last year with the company, which he left in 2010? More than $6 million in compensation.

Lockheed Martin is a Clinton Foundation donor. The company admitted to becoming a Clinton Global Initiative member in 2010.

According to records, Lockheed Martin is also a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, which paid Bill Clinton $250,000 to deliver a speech in 2010.

In 2010, Lockheed Martin won 17 approvals for private contracts from the Hillary Clinton State Department.

HSBC Holdings

In 2013, Comey became a board member, a director, and a Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee member of the London bank HSBC Holdings.

ÃÂMr. ComeyÃÂs appointment will be for an initial three-year term which, subject to re-election by shareholders, will expire at the conclusion of the 2016 Annual General Meeting,ÃÂ according to HSBC company records.

HSBC Holdings and its various philanthropic branches routinely partner with the Clinton Foundation. For instance, HSBC Holdings has partnered with Deutsche Bank through the Clinton Foundation to ÃÂretrofit 1,500 to 2,500 housing units, primarily in the low- to moderate-income sectorÃÂ in ÃÂNew York City.ÃÂ

ÃÂRetrofittingÃÂ refers to a Green initiative to conserve energy in commercial housing units. Clinton Foundation records show that the Foundation projected ÃÂ$1 billion in financingÃÂ for this Green initiative to conserve peopleÃÂs energy in low-income housing units.

Who Is Peter Comey?

When our source called the Chinatown offices of D.C. law firm DLA Piper and asked for ÃÂPeter Comey,ÃÂ a receptionist immediately put him through to ComeyÃÂs direct line. But Peter Comey is not featured on the DLA Piper website.

Peter Comey serves as ÃÂSenior Director of Real Estate Operations for the AmericasÃÂ for DLA Piper. James Comey was not questioned about his relationship with Peter Comey in his confirmation hearing.

DLA Piper is the firm that performed the independent audit of the Clinton Foundation in November during Clinton-WorldÃÂs first big push to put the email scandal behind them. DLA PiperÃÂs employees taken as a whole represent a major Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign donation bloc and Clinton Foundation donation base.

DLA Piper ranks #5 on Hillary ClintonÃÂs all-time career Top Contributors list, just ahead of Goldman Sachs.

And here is another thing: Peter Comey has a mortgage on his house that is owned by his brother James Comey, the FBI director.

Peter ComeyÃÂs financial records, obtained by Breitbart News, show that he bought a $950,000 house in Vienna, Virginia, in June 2008. He needed a $712,500 mortgage from First Savings Mortgage Corporation.

But on January 31, 2011, James Comey and his wife stepped in to become Private Party lenders. They granted a mortgage on the house for $711,000. Financial records suggest that Peter Comey took out two such mortgages from his brother that day.

This financial relationship between the Comey brothers began prior to James ComeyÃÂs nomination to become director of the FBI.

DLA Piper did not answer any question as to whether James Comey and Peter Comey spoke at any point about this mortgage or anything else during the Clinton email investigation."	1
208	"On Sunday's Last Week Tonight, John Oliver finally took on billionaire Donald Trump.

""I get that the character of Donald Trump is entertaining, and that he says things that people want to hear,"" Oliver said. ""And I know that his very name is powerful.""

But Oliver argued that Trump isn't what he seems. Here are some of the qualities many supporters have listed about Trump ÃÂ and Oliver's counterpoints:

""He tells it like it is"": ""Does he? Because the website PolitiFact checked 77 of his statements, and rated 76 percent of them as varying degrees of false.""
""He is truly independent and not beholden to anyone"": ""While it is true that he hasn't taken corporate money, the implication that he has personally spent $20 to $25 million is a bit of a stretch, because what he's actually done is loaned his own campaign $17.5 million and has just personally given just $250,000. And that's important, because up until the convention he can pay himself back for the loan with campaign funds.""
""He's tough"": ""For a tough guy, he has incredibly thin skin. Back in 1988, Spy magazine called him a short-fingered vulgarian. And ever since, the editor Graydon Carter says he receives envelopes from Trump, always with a photo on which he circled his hand to highlight the length of his fingers, usually with a note reading, 'See, not so short!'""
""His success"": ""While yes, he has made more money than most of us will make in a lifetime, not only did he get a multimillion-dollar inheritance from his father, but he's also lost a huge amount."" 

Oliver then played a clip of Trump's daughter saying, ""I remember once my father and I were walking down Fifth Avenue and there was a homeless person sitting right outside of Trump Tower. And I remember my father pointing to him and saying, 'You know, that guy has $8 billion more than me.' Because he was in such extreme debt at that point.""
Oliver also noted one other issue with Trump: He's wildly inconsistent. ""He's been pro-choice and pro-life, for and against assault weapon bans, in favor of both bringing in Syrian refugees and deporting them out of the country.""

Or take Trump's inconsistent statements on former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke's endorsement of Trump. To CNN, Trump said, ""I don't know anything about David Duke. Okay? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists.""

Oliver was not having it, pointing to Trump's past remarks to journalists: ""Really? That's your best answer there? Because you definitely know who he is ÃÂ partly because you called him 'a bigot' and 'a racist' in the past.""

Oliver concluded that the best way to take down Trump is to uncouple him from his brand ÃÂ his name. And it turns out that the Trump family's name was once Drumpf. Oliver explained how this could work:

If you are thinking of voting for Donald Trump, the charismatic guy promising to make America great again, stop and take a moment to imagine how you would feel if you just met a guy named Donald Drumpf, a litigious serial liar with a string of broken business ventures and the support of a former Klan leader who he can't decide whether or not to condemn. Would you think he would make a good president, or is the spell now somewhat broken?
""That is why tonight I am asking America to make Donald Drumpf again,"" Oliver added.

Oliver then announced the launch of the #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain and the website DonaldJDrumpf.com, where anyone can download a browser extension that replaces Trump's name with Drumpf.

209	PARADISE, NVÃÂMaterializing through a dimensional portal in front of a stunned audience at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, intergalactic law enforcement officers reportedly appeared onstage during Wednesday nightÃÂs presidential debate and placed a pair of glowing blue energy shackles on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ÃÂSecretary Clinton, you have been found in violation of interstellar law and have been called to stand trial before the Galactic Conclave,ÃÂ said the justice official from the Centaurus System while a pair of uniformed extraterrestrial enforcers grabbed the former first ladyÃÂs shoulders with their forelimbs and pincers and escorted her toward the rippling space-time rift from which they had entered. ÃÂBy order of the Nebulon Federation, you will depart with us at once to the Halls of Justice on Axio Prime, where you will await judgment for your crimes. If convicted, you face up to 900 cycles of hard labor within the comet mines of Zorlon B.ÃÂ At press time, ClintonÃÂs campaign team had issued a press statement referring to the criminal charges as ÃÂmore baseless accusationsÃÂ and assuring voters that the candidate has always complied with all transcosmic protocols.	0
210	"Since 2008 Obama and Democrats lost white working class voters across the US.

Middle class voters are Republican Trump voters.
Obama just sealed the deal with his anti-white racism.

The map below shows how Obama lost working class white voters in every state since taking office except for Vermont and Massachusetts.



New York Times

Democrats may have lost the white working class vote for generations.
ItÃÂs ObamaÃÂs fault.

And just this week Barack Obama was out again railing against white working class Americans for his partyÃÂs woes.
iPatriot reported:

Obama also blamed Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and the NRA for distracting the country from his message of ÃÂhope and changeÃÂ, particularly during the holiday season.

ÃÂIf weÃÂre not actually out there changing the narrative like we are during campaigns, then folks in a lot of these communities, what theyÃÂre hearing is Obama wants to take away my guns,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂ Obama is disrespecting my culture and is primarily concerned with coastal elites and minorities.ÃÂ Ah yes, the problem was you couldnÃÂt mindlessly brainwash the country Barack, not that your message was fundamentally anti-American.

Obama defended the robbers and hosted Black Lives Matter in the White House.

The Black Lives matter led to several police deaths, lootings and burned businesses.
Law-abiding white and black Americans have had enough.

Obama will be missed when he leaves the White HouseÃÂ
By the criminals and thugs."	1

Shame on you for calling on the ghost of your father. If you were anything like your father, Michael, you would have done something about the decline of this country.

Where were you Michael Reagan as this country started falling apart? Where were you Michael Reagan when the jobs in this country started disappearing? Why do these so-called Republicans have so much to say, now?

These so-called Republicans need to get on board. You guys arenÃÂt relevant anymore. This isnÃÂt a campaign to make you richer anymore. This is a campaign to make America richer again. We need our jobs.

Michael Reagan is the president of the Reagan Legacy Foundation. He spends his time celebrating his fatherÃÂs accomplishments and advocates for the issues that Ronald Reagan supported. You are just a legacy leech, Michael.

212	"ALBANY, N.Y. - A businessman who co-chaired the Trump campaign in New York state said Tuesday his recent derogatory statements about President Barack Obama and his wife werenÃÂt meant for publication but were nevertheless ÃÂinappropriateÃÂ and a ÃÂmistake.ÃÂ

Carl Paladino said he intended his email response to a weekly alternative publicationÃÂs survey to only go to a couple friends, not the newspaper. He said he mistakenly hit ÃÂreplyÃÂ on his computer instead of ÃÂforward.ÃÂ

The millionaire developer told Artvoice last week he hoped President Obama would die from mad cow disease and Michelle Obama would ÃÂreturn to being a male.ÃÂ

In PaladinoÃÂs Tuesday statement, first reported on BuffaloÃÂs WBEN radio, he apologizes to minorities, saying he ÃÂnever intended to hurtÃÂ them with his anti-Obama remarks. The comments sparked outrage from various political circles, including TrumpÃÂs transition team, which called the developerÃÂs comments ÃÂabsolutely reprehensible.ÃÂ

PaladinoÃÂs comments even drew a rebuke from his own son William, who runs the familyÃÂs development firm. The younger Paladino called the statements ÃÂdisrespectful and absolutely unnecessary.ÃÂ

The fatherÃÂs earlier comments about the president prompted at least two petitions, one calling for his removal from the Buffalo school board and the other seeking the removal of his name from a student town house at St. Bonaventure University, his alma mater and recipient of more than $1 million in donations from Carl Paladino over the years.

Paladino, a school board member since 2013, also said he wonÃÂt resign his elected position on the board.

ÃÂNo, IÃÂm not leaving the school board,ÃÂ he said in the statement, ÃÂnot when itÃÂs time to help implement the real choice elements of TrumpÃÂs plan for education reform.ÃÂ

The board is holding a special meeting Thursday to ÃÂdiscuss board member conduct.ÃÂ In New York, school board members typically can only be removed by the state education commissioner.

Paladino, 70, unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2010 as a Republican. The Democrat who defeated him, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, called the comments about the Obamas ÃÂracist, ugly and reprehensible.ÃÂ

Paladino made the comments Friday in response to an Artvoice survey that asked local artists, performers and business owners for their New YearÃÂs wish list.

Asked what he would most like to happen in 2017, Paladino responded that he hoped ÃÂObama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relationsÃÂ with a cow, dies and is buried in a cow pasture. 

Asked who he would like to see ÃÂgo away,ÃÂ he said Michelle Obama. 

ÃÂIÃÂd like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla,ÃÂ he wrote. 

In an emailed statement to the AP, Paladino, 70, claimed his comments had ÃÂnothing to do with raceÃÂ but instead reflected his opinion of the presidentÃÂs performance in office. 

ÃÂMerry Christmas and tough luck if you donÃÂt like my answer,ÃÂ he wrote. 

As recently as August, Paladino falsely claimed Mr. Obama was not Christian, telling the New York Observer that to average Americans, ÃÂThere is no doubt he is a Muslim.ÃÂ 

And in 2010, Paladino was criticized after it was revealed he had forwarded to friends racially charged emails that depicted Mr. Obama as a pimp. 

Paladino made no mention of any computer mistakes in a statement he released Friday after the publication posted his comments on its website. Instead, that statement ripped the Obamas, calling the president a ÃÂyellow-bellied cowardÃÂ and claiming the first lady ÃÂhated America before her husband wonÃÂ the White House."	0
213	"Contrary to the conventional wisdom saying that Bernie Sanders would never have been able to force a contested Democratic convention, Hillary Clinton has less than 2,383 pledged delegates. Thus, Bernie Sanders has recently confirmed his desire to continue, as stated by Time:

Bernie Sanders Vows to Continue ÃÂPolitical RevolutionÃÂ in New York

But that did not stop the Vermont Senator from defiantly promising to continue the political revolution in a town hall on Thursday, giving a glimpse into his possible future role in the Democratic Party in which he campaigns for progressive candidates across the country.

Speaking with the cadence and conviction of a viable candidate in midtown Manhattan, Sanders again did not concede the nominationÃÂand did not endorse his opponent. 
HereÃÂs the video of BernieÃÂs address from last week and thereÃÂs also no concession; only a reassurance to millions that his campaign is alive and well.

Therefore, progressive media and pundits should refrain from their gleeful calls to end BernieÃÂs campaign. VermontÃÂs Senator is taking his political revolution to Philadelphia and heÃÂll continue to run for the presidency.

Why would he stop?

Would you end your presidential campaign if your opponent faced on ongoing FBI criminal investigation?

Bernie Sanders, his campaign, and millions of supporters throughout the nation and world must wait until July 25th, knowing that the FBI will likely disclose its findings of ClintonÃÂs email investigation before the Democratic convention. POLITICO confirmed the other day that ClintonÃÂs email investigation is a ÃÂcriminal investigation,ÃÂ as stated by Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan:

Judge links Clinton aideÃÂs immunity to ÃÂcriminal investigationÃÂ
A former information technology aide to Hillary Clinton received immunity from the Justice Department in connection with a criminal investigation, a federal judge confirmed Tuesday.

Bryan Pagliano, a computer expert who worked at the State Department while Clinton was secretary of state and was also paid privately by her, was previously reported to have received immunity in connection with statements he gave to the FBI about ClintonÃÂs private server set-up.

However, there had been no explicit confirmation that the investigationÃÂwhich Clinton has repeatedly referred to as a ÃÂsecurity reviewÃÂÃÂis actually a criminal probe.

ÃÂThe privacy interests at stake are high because the governmentÃÂs criminal investigation through which Mr. Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential,ÃÂ U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote in an order issued Tuesday.
When a U.S. District Court Judge confirms your opponent faces a ÃÂcriminalÃÂ investigation, thereÃÂs no reason to concede or leave a race for the presidency. Furthermore, Judge Sullivan clearly stated ÃÂThe privacy interests at stake are high because the governmentÃÂs criminal investigation through which Mr. Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential.ÃÂ

ClintonÃÂs ÃÂsecurity reviewÃÂ days are over, especially since the White House also confirmed the criminal investigation.

But thereÃÂs no chance of Clinton facing legal consequences, right?

If you know the answer to this question, then tell the world next yearÃÂs winner of the Super Bowl. Also, explain how Clinton circumvents repercussions from the following NBC article titled Hillary Clinton Emails Held Info Beyond Top Secret:

Emails from Hillary ClintonÃÂs home server contained information classified at levels higher than previously known, including a level meant to protect some of the most sensitive U.S. intelligence, according to a document obtained by NBC News.

In a letter to lawmakers, the intelligence communityÃÂs internal watchdog says some of ClintonÃÂs emails contained information classified Top Secret/Special Access Program, a secrecy designation that includes some of the most closely held U.S. intelligence matters.

Two American intelligence officials tell NBC News these are not the same two emails from ClintonÃÂs server that have long been reported as containing information deemed Top SecretÃÂ

While she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, Clinton conducted government business over private email. The arrangement was particularly unusual because the email system relied not on Yahoo or Google but her own server, which she kept in her home in Westchester County, N.Y.
The act of transferring Special Access Program intelligence from secure government networks onto an unsecure private server correlates directly to the Espionage Act. I explain why ClintonÃÂs Special Access Program intelligence will lead to a Bernie Sanders presidency in the following YouTube segment.

Finally, nothing proves both election fraud and a Bernie Sanders presidency better than ClintonÃÂs treatment of donors. As stated by CNN last week, Secretary of State Clinton put a Chicago commodities trader on an advisory board regarding nuclear strategy:

Washington (CNN) A major political donor to the Clintons and other top Democrats was selected by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to serve on a key State Department intelligence board in 2011, despite having no clear background in the area, according to emails released this weekÃÂ

In July 2011, Fernando was appointed to a seat on the International Security Advisory Board (ISAB), a panel filled with top-level foreign policy advisers and security experts. Former Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart chairs the current panel, which includes retired generals, the former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other high-ranking national security expertsÃÂ

As a member of the top-level group, Fernando was granted a Top Secret security clearance and given access to highly sensitive information.

Fernando, professional State Department staff noted, seemed an awkward selection for the group and spurred concern when an ABC News reporter inquired about him in 2011ÃÂ

An aide, Wade Boese, replied that night that Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills had added FernandoÃÂs name to the list of appointees approved by Clinton. ÃÂThe true answer is that S staff (Cheryl Mills) added him. The boardÃÂs membership preceded me. Raj was not on the list sent to S; he was added at their insistence,ÃÂ Boese wrote. ÃÂSÃÂ refers to Clinton, ABC News reported.
Not only did this commodities trader have no background in nuclear strategy, but heÃÂs also a Democratic super delegate.

Still believe the system didnÃÂt favor Clinton?

From private servers to advisory boards with donors and super delegates, ClintonÃÂs candidacy is unique in American history. I recently challenged Nate Cohn and Harry Enten (polling experts who failed to predict the rise of Bernie or Trump) on the data pertaining to presidential candidates and FBI criminal investigations. I asked if they could crunch the numbers, and come up with some kind of analysis on whether or not Clinton will become president, based on prior candidates facing FBI criminal probes.

Something tells me that most observers have conveniently ignored the fact BernieÃÂs challenger risks serious legal consequences. One can only imagine what pundits would say about Bernie Sanders if he were in ClintonÃÂs position. Therefore, Bernie has every reason to stay in the race, especially since nobody has ever become nominee alongside an FBI criminal probe.

With Bernie Sanders, thereÃÂs no risk of scandal or FBI investigations. The talk of Bernie leaving the race must stop, especially since ClintonÃÂs emails will dominate the media very soon. Bernie Sanders just made it official, and after the FBI discloses its findings, expect Bernie Sanders to become Democratic Nominee. The ÃÂdata drivenÃÂ analysis on candidates with ongoing FBI criminal investigations says Bernie Sanders is still the front-runner in 2016."	0
214	"Once, Harry Reid pushed through ÃÂthe nuclear optionÃÂ to thwart the Republicans from representing their constituents. That very move is now coming back to haunt his Liberals peers just as Reid makes his long overdue exit from Congress.

He was warned that he and his fellow Democrats would one day regret this, but the arrogant Nevada Senators ignored the sound words of advice.That day has now arrived. The nuclear option will allow the Republican-controlled Senate to turn bills into law by a simple majority of 51 votes and not the super majority which requires 60 votes of approval, as Biz Pac Review notes.

Harry ReidÃÂs nuclear option requiring only 51 votes to pass measures in the Senate coincided with exactly the number of seats Liberals held at the time. Now, the Republicans control both the House and Senate ÃÂ which will allow them to easily pass all of the items President-Elect Donald TrumpÃÂs agenda, if the career GOP politicians have the nerve, of course.

Should any GOP Senators jump ship and a rare tie occur in the Senate, TrumpÃÂs agenda will still survive a nuclear option vote. Vice President-Elect Mike Pence holds the tie-breaking vote!

At least in public, Liberals are not willing to admit they are kicking themselves over following Harry ReidÃÂs urgings on the nuclear option vote. At the time, Reid claimed the extreme rule change was necessary because the GOP was engaged in ÃÂunprecedented obstruction.ÃÂ

Apparently saying ÃÂNO!ÃÂ to  economically unfeasible Obama dictates is obstruction. The Republicans were following the Constitution and doing the job they were elected by We the People to do ÃÂ which they can now do even more easily thanks to Harry Reid.

ÃÂIf Republicans want to go on record supporting radicals, thatÃÂs their decision and they will have to live with it,ÃÂ Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for Sen. Reid, said. If its radical to put Americans first, than so be it.

Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley claims he has ÃÂabsolutely no regret,ÃÂ over ReidÃÂs nuclear option. Charles Schumer, the incoming Senate Minority Leader, doesnÃÂt appear to have been all that eager to accept the nuclear option.

Schumer reportedly wanted to keep the super majority vote threshold for both cabinet and Supreme Court appointments. Either his peers in the Senate did not share his concerns about the future when Republicans would be back in power, and felt Liberals would always be able to maintain a majority in the Senate, or were just too afraid of Harry Reid to vote against his plan.

One Liberal Senator, Richard Shelby from Alabama, tried to warn his fellow Democrats they were engaging in short term thinking when voting in favor of the nuclear option. They ignored his wise words as well, and totally ignored the big picture when placing their votes.

ÃÂDemocrats wonÃÂt be in power in perpetuity. This is a mistake ÃÂ a big one for the long run. Maybe not for the short run. Short-term gains, but I think it changes the Senate tremendously in a bad way,ÃÂ Senator Shelby said before the vote was taken in 2013.

Following both the text and the spirit of the Constitution while putting America and Americans first, would only be considered a radical concept by Liberals who have sipped far too much of the Kool-Aid handed out by the members of the politically correct far-left contingent in Washington.

Democrats will now be at the mercy of Donald Trump and the elected public servants across the aisle for at least the next four years ÃÂand they have only themselves to blame!"	1

Maria Gonzalez an employee at the Folks INN & Suites Hotel in Phoenix brought room service to his room witnessed it all.

216	"WASHINGTON ÃÂ President Obama says he has no regrets about his go-it-alone use of executive power ÃÂ even if President-elect Donald Trump can now use those same powers to roll back his policies.

""I think that he is entirely within his lawful power to do so,"" Obama said in an interview with National Public Radio broadcast Monday. ""If he wants to reverse some of those rules, that's part of the democratic process.""

In his traditional end-of-year public radio interview, Obama offered a wide-ranging defense of his use of presidential power as he prepares to turn the levers of that power over to man he once described as unfit for the presidency.

Obama argued that his use of executive action wasn't much different from his predecessors. What changed, he said, is that Congress became less willing to pass legislation.

""Congress has become so dysfunctional that more and more of a burden is placed on the agencies to fill in the gaps, and the gaps get bigger and bigger because they're not constantly refreshed and tweaked,"" he said. ""And the bottom line is, if you want to right-size executive power relative to the other branches of government, the best way to do that is to have a healthy Congress in which the two parties are debating, disagreeing but also occasionally working together to pass legislation.""

The same thing has happened on foreign policy, he said. The Obama administration has been relying a post-9/11 congressional war authorization intended for al-Qaeda in order to battle the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

""The danger is that over time, Congress starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having the president do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in,"" he said. ""The president and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting America, because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debate.""

But Obama also said he's installed ""guardrails"" on the president's war powers, setting up systems of internal accountability on issues like drone strikes and electronic surveillance by the National Security Agency.

""You know, there are some critics on the left who would argue we haven't gone far enough on that. I would argue that we've gotten it about right, although I'm the first one to admit that we didn't get it all right on day one,"" he said."	0

218	"A bombshell study released by Stanford University confirms evidence of election fraud during the 2016 Democratic Party primaries. 

According to a paper released this week entitled, ÃÂAre we witnessing a dishonest election?,ÃÂ a state comparison based on the voting procedures used during the election reveals endemic election fraud within the system.

Given the stakes in the outcome of the American presidential elections, ensuring the integrity of the electoral process is of the utmost importance.

Are the results we are witnessing in the 2016 primary elections trustworthy? While Donald Trump enjoyed a clear and early edge over his Republican rivals, the Democratic contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernard Sanders has been far more competitive.

At present, Secretary Clinton enjoys an apparent advantage over Sanders. Is this claimed advantage legitimate?

We contend that it is not, and suggest an explanation for the advantage: States that are at risk for election fraud in 2016 systematically and overwhelmingly favor Secretary Clinton. We provide converging evidence for this claim.

First, we show that it is possible to detect irregularities in the 2016 Democratic Primaries by comparing the states that have hard paper evidence of all the placed votes to states that do not have this hard paper evidence. Second, we compare the final results in 2016 to the discrepant exit polls.

Furthermore, we show that no such irregularities occurred in the 2008 competitive election cycle involving Secretary Clinton against President Obama.

As such, we find that in states wherein voting fraud has the highest potential to occur, systematic efforts may have taken place to provide Secretary Clinton with an exaggerated margin of support."	1
219	"President Obama headed to a golf course moments after receiving reports that a truck had plowed through a Christmas market in Berlin in a potential terrorist attack, according to White House pool reports.

Obama, who is vacationing in Hawaii for the holidays, was also briefed by his national security team on the assassination of RussiaÃÂs ambassador to Turkey just before departing for the Mid-Pacific Country Club.

White House press liaison Eric Schultz wrote in a memo that Obama left his rental vacation home at 10:21 a.m. HST, or 3:21 p.m. EST, after a press van held at the house for 11 minutes awaiting the president.

ÃÂSpectators on the street threw shakas and recorded photos or video on cell phones as the motorcade made the 10-minute drive to Mid-Pacific Country Club, where the president will be golfing under cloudy skies,ÃÂ Schultz wrote, according to Mediate.

Nine people were killed and at least 50 others were injured in the Berlin truck attack. Police believe the incident was deliberate.

Russia, meanwhile, declared the killing of Ambassador Andrey Karlov in Ankara an ÃÂact of terrorism.ÃÂ

The president has faced scrutiny for his decisions to golf during crises.

220	"RICHMOND, VA (SatireWire.com) ÃÂ Donald TrumpÃÂs shock election has dramatically shifted the political landscape in the home of Deirdre and Scott Taylor of Richmond, Va., as ScottÃÂs vote for Trump has caused Deirdre to redraw the physical and emotional boundaries of their relationship, in lieu of just killing him.

ÃÂDue to the incomprehensible votes cast by certain members of this household electorate, I am shifting policy to address the very real threat that my husband Scott is an idiot,ÃÂ said Deirdre Taylor of Richmond, Va. ÃÂAs a result, I am today redistricting our house such that Scott resides only his areas, specifically the basement, the garage, the couch ÃÂ every night ÃÂ and the yard, although not in areas of the yard where I can see him or hear him or smell him.ÃÂ

The bedroom, she added, is now the equivalent of the post-industrial Midwestern states that went for Trump.

ÃÂItÃÂs a place of anger and sadness that was once a thriving hub of activity but now thatÃÂs gone and itÃÂs never coming back,ÃÂ she said.

The Taylors, who have been married for 12 years, are among thousands of couples in the U.S. that are struggling to adapt to the seismic shift in their once-united states, a shift brought on by a vote in which the women voted for Hillary Clinton and the men chose Trump.

Ironically, many of these white, suburban males now find themselves holding the status of the women and minorities Trump often railed against.

ÃÂIÃÂve talked it over with Deirdre and our friends, and my husband Kirk and his buddies will now be marginalized, under-served and, politically and in all other ways, impotent,ÃÂ said Kora Ann Snelling, a neighbor of DeirdreÃÂs. ÃÂUsing terms Mr. Trump and my husband can understand, theyÃÂll be vaginally bankrupt.ÃÂ

For the Taylors, the shift became apparent late on election night as they watched the results come in.

ÃÂI asked Scott if he voted for Hillary, and he said, ÃÂUmÃÂÃÂ Deirdre recalled.

ÃÂThatÃÂs all I said! ÃÂUm,ÃÂ Scott explained.

ÃÂBecause you couldnÃÂt bring yourself to admit you voted for a race-baiting, misogynistic pathological liar who draws support from white nationalists and boasts of sexual assault!ÃÂ Deirdre countered.

ÃÂBut I justÃÂ wanted to make American great again,ÃÂ Scott protested.

ÃÂWhy donÃÂt you make the doghouse great again instead?ÃÂ Deirdre replied.

ÃÂWe donÃÂt have a dog,ÃÂ Scott pointed out.

ÃÂWell get Mexico to build you one!ÃÂ she said.

While Trump doesnÃÂt take office until January, Deirdre has already taken steps to institute a core tenet of her new policy.

ÃÂI have completed a virtual border wall between myself and the father of our children ÃÂ our two daughters! ÃÂ and if he so much as attempts to approach he will be treated as an enemy combatant,ÃÂ she said.

At press time, Deirdre was reading the children a book about tolerance while Scott was trapped in a hell of his own making."	0
221	"Like many foreign scientists in Britain, Joanna Bagniewska was devastated when Britons voted to leave the European Union. The biology lecturer, a Polish migrant who found Britain a welcoming place to build her academic career over a decade, is suddenly seeing her job security and research prospects up in the air.

""I'm worried that after my current contract finishes, one of the prerequisites could be a permanent residence card,"" she said. ""I'd like to apply for EU grant money, but how much longer will it be available for?""

Britain's top universities have long been among the world's most sought-after destinations for study and research, drawing the brightest minds from all corners of the globe. But since Britons voted in June to leave the 28-nation EU, many in the science community say the U.K. risks losing the money, the international influence ÃÂ and crucially, the talent ÃÂ to sustain that enviable position.

More than one-tenth of research funding at British universities has come from the EU in recent years. Some fields ÃÂ such as nanotechnology and cancer research ÃÂ are more dependent on EU funding than others, according to a report by technology firm Digital Science. From 2007 to 2013, Britain received 8.8 billion euros ($9.4 billion) in direct EU investment in research.

Bagniewska is not just anxious about herself ÃÂ she's upset for her students' future too, for the opportunities that both Britons and foreigners will likely miss out on when unfettered mobility between Britain and Europe can no longer be taken for granted.

""They were just getting excited about doing their masters and Ph.Ds in other countries. And then Brexit happened and they just got trampled,"" she said.

Scientists and researchers argue that being part of the EU has given British science a huge boost because it allows Britain to recruit the best talent across Europe and take part in important research collaborations and student exchanges without being constrained by national boundaries. The bloc's freedom of movement means its 500 million people can live and work visa-free in any member state.

No one knows yet what form Britain's exit from the EU ÃÂ commonly known as Brexit ÃÂ is going to take, but immigration was a key issue for ""Leave"" voters. Many believe some limit should be put on the number of EU citizens moving to Britain.

Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to reassert control over British borders. She has offered no firm guarantees for the rights of Europeans already living in Britain, an uncertainty that weighs heavily over the 32,000 Europeans who make up 16 percent of the academic workforce in British universities. Many universities say the rhetoric over immigration control is also jeopardizing recruitment of researchers and students from further afield.

Scientists for EU, an advocacy group, says it has received over 400 letters from researchers describing how Brexit has already impacted their life and work. Some are losing doctoral students who pulled out of studentships and job offers. Academics are putting plans to relocate to Britain on hold. One said their employer, a London university, immediately imposed a temporary hiring freeze, citing uncertainties about student recruitment and research income.

Adam Durrant, a British entrepreneur who founded an aerospace startup supplying climate data to airlines and aircraft manufacturers, says he's now considering moving some of his business to a EU country outside of Britain. Part of the reason, he says, is that Brexit will likely make hiring the right people much harder than before.

""In the future, it probably means that people would be less interested to come to the U.K. to work,"" said Durrant. ""There's a huge question mark over my company and my own personal future. I will certainly retain a U.K. presence, but my company's focus of gravity may shift elsewhere.""

Scientists say some U.K.-based researchers are already being excluded from joint bids for EU funding to minimize the risks for their colleagues.

Paul Crowther, head of physics and astronomy at the University of Sheffield, said a researcher from his department was dropped from an EU grant proposal as a precaution following the Brexit referendum. The vote ""put the U.K.-based researchers in a very awkward position"" and their participation in EU-funded programs could ""compromise the project,"" he was told.

""The erosion of U.K. involvement in EU networks has already begun, with both the U.K. and EU science worse off,"" Crowther said.

Apart from a loss of grant money, Brexit will likely cause British scientists and research centers to miss out on shared databases and infrastructure.

""Large-scale efforts like studies of rare genetic diseases, the building of large facilities, are areas that multinational collaborations do much better,"" said Venki Ramakrishnan, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist and president of Britain's prestigious Royal Society.

The EU is an important source of research funding for Britain, which lags behind many developed countries in state investment in science. In 2014, Britain's government spent under 0.5 percent of its GDP on research ÃÂ below the European average, and half that of South Korea.

May's government is clearly aware of the jitters. She has promised to increase annual investment in research by 2 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) by 2020, in hopes her country can remain a world leader in science and innovation.

Durrant is doubtful that's enough to make a big difference.

""Two billion a year spread across everything isn't going to go very far,"" he said.

Similar anxieties are being felt at the undergraduate level. The 125,000 European students studying at British universities now pay the same fees as locals and have access to the same government loans. Officials have promised this will not change for those applying next year ÃÂ but no one knows what will happen after that.

Fewer European students appeared to be applying for some of Britain's most competitive university courses, including medicine and places at Oxford and Cambridge. In September, the admission service UCAS reported a 9 percent drop in EU applications for British undergraduate courses starting in 2017.

Some argue that Britain could become like Switzerland, an ""associate"" EU state that is opting out of free movement of people while still taking part in limited European science projects.

""It's not all doom and gloom ÃÂ but it will be harder,"" Ramakrishnan said. ""We could make a go of it outside the EU. But for that to happen, we have to attract talent and fund science. And those two things are critical."""	0
222	"TRUMP TOWER ÃÂ With his poll numbers among black voters hovering around 1%, presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump reportedly tapped actress and FOX News contributor Stacey Dash as his ÃÂNegro Outreach ProgramÃÂ Ambassador.

ÃÂShe connects with that group,ÃÂ said Trump, ÃÂand sheÃÂll be terrific. Did you see her at the Oscars? She was terrific as the Minority Outreach Director, so we brought her on board. WeÃÂre lucky to have her. SheÃÂs controversial, but sheÃÂs one of the good ones.ÃÂ

Dash recently created controversy by calling GreyÃÂs Anatomy actor Jesse Williams a ÃÂplantation slaveÃÂ after his BET Awards speech calling for an end to racism and what he called ÃÂcultural appropriation.ÃÂ

Trump said now more than ever, ÃÂespecially with ÃÂCrooked HillaryÃÂ siphoning off my blacks,ÃÂ minority outreach is the difference between winning and losing in November.

ÃÂYou know what will happen,ÃÂ said Trump. ÃÂThe media will come down on me for saying ÃÂmy blacks.ÃÂ They did that in California with that African-American fellow in the crowd, but you know what? I donÃÂtÃÂ care. Stacey will respond to all the groups we need to reach.ÃÂ

One of those groups is the transgender community, Last June, the Clueless actressÃÂ comments about bathroom use by transgender individuals created heated controversy. Dash said people who ÃÂcanÃÂt decide what they wanna be that dayÃÂ should go to the bathroom ÃÂin the bushes.ÃÂ

Sources say TrumpÃÂs camp may even be vetting Dash for vice president. So far, TrumpÃÂs short list includes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and former House Speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich.

ÃÂSheÃÂs very well-informed. SheÃÂs quite affected. WeÃÂve been looking into it,ÃÂ said Trump.

When asked if the term ÃÂNegroÃÂ was a proper term to use in 2016, a Trump spokesman said, ÃÂThe trouble with saying ÃÂAfrican-AmericanÃÂ is that not all blacks are from Africa, and some of them arenÃÂt even Americans. Some of them are from Central America, and even Puerto Rico.ÃÂ

ÃÂTo be inclusive, we decided against ÃÂcolored,ÃÂ since the NAACP still uses that. We said no to ÃÂblack,ÃÂ because that sounded too polarizing. In the end, we went with ÃÂnegro.ÃÂ ItÃÂs historically accurate. Nothing racist about it.ÃÂ

ÃÂNot everything is about race,ÃÂ added the spokesman. ÃÂWe hope Stacey Dash will make that fact clear to you people once and for all.ÃÂ

223	"In his latest Twitter tirade, President-elect Donald Trump has once again claimed he could have won more votes than his rival Hillary Clinton.
""I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently,"" he said.
The Republican insisted his strategy was more ""sophisticated"".
He won nearly three million fewer votes than the Democratic candidate, but prevailed in the electoral college.
The arcane but all-important institution formally certified him earlier this week as winner of the 2016 presidential election.
But the Manhattan billionaire is apparently still chafing at critics' claims that he lacks a popular mandate.
What exactly is the electoral college?
In two other tweets on Wednesday morning, Mr Trump said: ""Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!""

The businessman - who is spending the festive season at his resort in Florida - added: ""I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!""
But Mr Trump appears to have conceded finally that he lost the popular vote.
Late last month he erroneously claimed in a tweet that ""in addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally"".
He later tweeted that there was ""serious voter fraud"" in Virginia, New Hampshire, and California.
No such electoral illegality has been adduced by US election officials or observers.
Mr Trump will be inaugurated as the 45th US president on 20 January.

224	"WASHINGTON, D.C. ÃÂ According to a new report scheduled for public release this week by the Government Accountability Office, President ObamaÃÂs bathroom breaks may have cost U.S. taxpayers just over $4 billion in 2015. Data provided to the GAO by the Obama administration shows that on average, President Barack Obama took 3.5 bathroom breaks a day last year, with each trip to the toilet lasting four minutes or less.

By the GAOÃÂs estimate, the commander-in-chief spent just over eighty-five hours in the bathroom in 2015 alone. ÃÂThe question on everyoneÃÂs mind when they look at a report like this is, ÃÂWhat exactly is he doing in there?'ÃÂ Wondered Republican senator John McCain. The former POW admitted to C-SPAN that he goes to the bathroom about once a day ÃÂon a good day.ÃÂ

Even so, the Arizona senator cited a particularly disturbing quote from the report stating that on October 23rd, the day former secretary of state Hillary Clinton was scheduled to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, President Obama took a record-breaking twenty-one minute bathroom break. ÃÂI think itÃÂs very telling,ÃÂ Senator McCain said.

ÃÂThe average adult male uses the restroom anywhere from three times a day to once every three days,ÃÂ said Dr. Deepak Gupta, a senior scatologist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. ÃÂIdeally we see about one ounce of stool per every twelve pounds of body weight,ÃÂ Dr. Gupta explained, continuing, ÃÂWith that said, President Obama -who weighs about one hundred eighty pounds, should produce about fifteen ounces of solid fecal matter per bowel movement.ÃÂ

However, Dr. Gupta pointed out that due to unusually high levels of stress associated with the job of running the country, President Obama likely produces well below average stools. ÃÂIn all probability, the guy is a stool softener addict,ÃÂ Dr. Gupta told Real News Right Now.

Despite President ObamaÃÂs low performance rating in the bathroom, the GAO estimates he still uses an above-average amount of toilet paper and -if heÃÂs a courtesy flusher, as White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest once hinted, he uses at least twice as much water per visit to the menÃÂs room as the average American. This, coupled with the obvious breaks in productivity, has cost taxpayers a whopping $4.1 billion.

ÃÂThis is simply unacceptable,ÃÂ Florida senator and GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio told Real News Right Now. ÃÂThis is the kind of imprudent overzealous spending that I intend to do away with.ÃÂ Senator Rubio said he and other Republican congressmen -in an effort to save taxpayers ÃÂa buck or two,ÃÂ often wear adult diapers while on Capitol Hill. ÃÂItÃÂs uncomfortable but from a moral standpoint, itÃÂs the right thing to do. We as elected officials owe that much to our constituents.ÃÂ"	1
225	"This is my last column until after the election, so IÃÂd like to address the people least likely to read it: Donald Trump voters. Who knows? Maybe IÃÂll get lucky and a few of them will buy fish wrapped in this column, and theyÃÂll accidentally peruse it! Desperate times call for desperate measures.

While IÃÂve opposed the Trump candidacy from the start, IÃÂve never disparaged Trump voters. Some are friends and neighbors; theyÃÂre all fellow Americans. We should take their concerns seriously. But we should also demand that they be serious, that they draw distinctions between these two presidential candidates.

Yes, Hillary Clinton is a flawed leader ÃÂ but in the way so many presidents were. We know her flaws: She has a weakness for secrecy, occasionally fudges truths, has fawning aides and a husband who lacks discipline when it comes to moneymaking and women. But she is not indecent, and that is an important distinction. And sheÃÂs studious, has sought out people of substance on every issue and has taken the job of running for president seriously.

Trump is not only a flawed politician, heÃÂs an indecent human being. HeÃÂs boasted of assaulting women ÃÂ prompting 11 to come forward to testify that he did just that to them; his defense is that he could not have assaulted these women because they werenÃÂt pretty enough.

HeÃÂs created a university that was charged with defrauding its students. HeÃÂs been charged with discriminating against racial minorities in his rental properties. HeÃÂs stiffed countless vendors, from piano sellers to major contractors. HeÃÂs refused to disclose his tax returns because they likely reveal that heÃÂs paid no federal taxes for years, is in bed with dodgy financiers and doesnÃÂt give like he says to charity.

HeÃÂs compared the sacrifice of parents of a soldier killed in Iraq to his ÃÂsacrificeÃÂ of building tall buildings. HeÃÂs vowed, if elected, to prosecute his campaign rival.

We have never seen such behaviors in a presidential candidate.

At the same time, Trump has shown no ability to talk about any policy issue with any depth. Harlan CobenÃÂs debate-night tweet last month had it right: ÃÂOn Aleppo he sounds like a fifth grader giving a book report on a book he never read.ÃÂ

I understand why many Trump supporters have lost faith in Washington and want to just ÃÂshake things up.ÃÂ When you shake things up with a studied plan and a clear idea of where you want to get to, you can open new futures. But when you shake things up, guided by one-liners and no moral compass, you can cause enormous instability and systemic vertigo.

PRIVACY POLICY
But there is an even more important reason Trump supporters, particularly less-educated white males, should be wary of his bluster: His policies wonÃÂt help them. Trump promises to bring their jobs back. But most of their jobs didnÃÂt go to a Mexican. They went to a microchip.

The idea that large numbers of manual factory jobs can be returned to America if we put up a wall with Mexico or renegotiate our trade deals is a fantasy. Trump ignores the fact that manufacturing is still by far the largest sector of the U.S. economy. Indeed, our factories now produce twice what they did in 1984 ÃÂ but with one-third fewer workers.

Trump canÃÂt change that. Machines and software will keep devouring, and spawning, more work of all kinds. Did you hear that IBMÃÂs cognitive computer, Watson, helped to create a pop song, ÃÂNot Easy,ÃÂ with the Grammy-winning producer Alex da Kid? The song was released on Oct. 21, IBM noted, and within 48 hours it climbed to No. 4 on iTunesÃÂs Hot Tracks.

No one knows for certain how we deal with this new race with and against machines, but I can assure you itÃÂs not TrumpÃÂs way ÃÂ build walls, restrict trade, give huge tax cuts to the rich. The best jobs in the future are going to be what I call ÃÂSTEMpathy jobs ÃÂ jobs that blend STEM skills (science, technology, engineering, math) with human empathy. We donÃÂt know what many of them will look like yet.

The smartest thing we can do now is to keep our economy as open and flexible as possible ÃÂ to get the change signals first and be able to quickly adapt; create the opportunity for every American to engage in lifelong learning, because whatever jobs emerge will require more knowledge; make sure that learning stresses as much of the humanities and human interactive skills as hard sciences; make sure we have an immigration policy that continues to attract the worldÃÂs most imaginative risk-takers; and strengthen our safety nets, because this era will leave more people behind.

This is the only true path to American greatness in the 21st century. Trump wants to make America great in ways that are just not available anymore. ÃÂWhat do we have to loseÃÂ by trying his way? Trump asks. The answer is: everything that actually makes us great. When the world gets this fast, small errors in navigation have huge consequences.

While Clinton has failed to inspire, her instincts and ideas will keep us hewing to basically the right course. And however great her flaws, she is still in the zone of human decency. Trump is not.

We can never be great as a country with a president with the warped values of Donald Trump. I pray that in the end at least some Trump voters, my fellow Americans, will see that."	0
226	"Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul gave an indication today of the trouble that President-elect Trump may face from his own party in trying to fulfill campaign promises that cost money.

The former GOP presidential candidate said on ABC News' ""This Week"" that he ""won't vote for a budget that never balances"" and that he is working to find a few other conservative GOP senators to join him.

""The current budget that the Republicans are looking at never balances. How can that be fiscally responsible? And how can we look at the public with a straight face and say, yes, we ran on balanced budgets, we're for the balanced budget amendment, and yet the budget we're going to introduce, that we're going to repeal Obamacare with never balances?"" Paul said.

Trump this week repeated his promise that he wants a trillion-dollar infrastructure program and he promised during the campaign to repeal Obamacare.

Paul said that with the help of other conservative senators he might be able to block a budget that he considers irresponsible.

""All it takes is a couple of us. If there are a few conservatives in the Senate wing of the Republican Party that will say no to a budget that never balances, we could have the power to say to the leadership, you know what, we need a better budget,"" Paul said.

""I don't know if it will happen, but I know that I will be one that won't vote for a budget that never balances,"" he said.

Paul also addressed reports that ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson has emerged as a likely pick for secretary of state, saying that he is ""going to reserve judgment on Tillerson.""

But the Kentucky senator had strong warnings about former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who is a possible contender for secretary of state or deputy secretary of state.

""I'll do anything to try to prevent John Bolton from getting any position because I think his world view is naive,"" Paul said. ""He still believes in regime change. He's still a big cheerleader for the Iraq War. He's promoted a nuclear attack by Israel on Iran. He wants to do regime change in Iran.""

""John Bolton doesn't get it,"" Paul said."	0
227	WEST PALM BEACH, FLÃÂResponding to his flagging poll numbers and a string of newspaper editorials and cable news pundits questioning his fitness to lead, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reportedly complained to a rally crowd Thursday that for the entirety of this race, his personality has been rigged against him. ÃÂFrom day one, my internal thought processes and overall temperament have completely stacked the deck against my candidacyÃÂitÃÂs so obvious, folks, you canÃÂt deny it,ÃÂ said Trump, claiming that all facets of his character, from his egocentric worldview to his brash, vitriolic responses to even the smallest and most inconsequential provocations, have been colluding to ruin his chances of ever reaching the Oval Office. ÃÂOpen your eyes, people! Just look at how I routinely project the fear and hatred inside of me onto others, or my total lack of impulse control, conscientiousness, and tact. My personality is doing everythingÃÂand I mean everythingÃÂto make sure I never have a chance.ÃÂ Trump then reportedly vowed that no matter how many of his own character traits aligned against him, he would never let his personality stop him from becoming president, drawing raucous cheers from the crowd.	0
228	"A group of millennial activists from across the country plan to open a ÃÂmovement houseÃÂ in Washington DC next month, which will serve as a permanent base to protest Donald TrumpÃÂs presidency.

The organizers are mostly women of color, many of whom campaigned for Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary.

The house, which will be set up by inauguration day on 20 January, has been dubbed ÃÂDistrict 13ÃÂ, in a reference to a rebellious neighborhood in the Hunger Games books and films.

Activists told the Guardian that it will serve as a ÃÂspace for the best kinds of troublemakers from around the countryÃÂ. The property will be located in Capitol Hill, close to the White House and the Capitol building, and will enable activists to quickly mobilize against Trump should he court controversy during his presidency.

ÃÂUltimately itÃÂs to make sure we hold him accountable,ÃÂ said Moumita Ahmed, the founder of Millennials for Revolution, a group which span off from the Bernie Sanders-supporting Millennials for Bernie.

ÃÂBecause his presidency is not normal at all. ItÃÂs our duty to make sure he doesnÃÂt succeed.

ÃÂIf he succeeds itÃÂs a message that everything he stood for is OK. That itÃÂs OK to get to power in the way that he did, and hurt all the people heÃÂs hurt.ÃÂ

District 13 will be open to activist groups around the country who wish to demonstrate in the capital, Ahmed said. The house is inspired by movement houses from the civil rights era, which served as a safe haven for people to plan marches and protests.

People from ethnic-minority activist groups, such as African Americans for Bernie and Color of Change, are involved in planning for the movement house, while climate change and minimum wage campaigners have also contributed.

ÃÂMost of the people involved are people who will most definitely be affected by this administration,ÃÂ Ahmed said.

ÃÂAs someone who is from a Muslim family, IÃÂm invested in the safety of my community. And I see this administration as a threat to my community, especially because of the rhetoric that was used to become the president.ÃÂ

The groups launched a crowdfunding effort on Tuesday to support District 13. They aim to reach $50,000, which will cover the houseÃÂs rent for one year.

Erika Peralta, who has worked for Color of Change ÃÂ an organization with more than one million members that works to ÃÂcreate a more human and less hostile world for black people in AmericaÃÂ ÃÂ is another organizer of District 13. She plans to live in the house for the first three months of TrumpÃÂs presidency.

ÃÂThe aim is to be a focal point and a nexus for activists and progressive people across the country to provide them resources and aid and our networks to stop any hatred that may come from the White House or to stand up against it,ÃÂ Peralta said.

ÃÂWeÃÂre going to work to make sure that whatever [Trump] is trying to do, whether itÃÂs a Muslim registry or deport a bunch of immigrants, weÃÂre not going to let that happen.ÃÂ"	0

ÃÂPutin only understands force, and we therefore have no choice but to respond with force,ÃÂ U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry thought moments before meeting with Sergei Lavrov, RussiaÃÂs Foreign Minister. ÃÂLavrov, you have 24 hours to get your troops out of Crimea or itÃÂs war,ÃÂ Kerry said to himself in the mirror before going out and saying nothing of the kind.

ÃÂI hereby authorize the Atlantic fleet to strike Russian bases in Crimea and cripple Russian missile batteries on the border with Eastern Ukraine, after which we will send in ground troops to remove the Russian menace,ÃÂ Obama told his top brass, after which he imagined Senate thorn John McCain shouting, ÃÂYou go girl!ÃÂ


European leaders were no less internally outspoken as they visualized putting self-interest aside and finally defying the Kremlin.

We are told we can report the fact that Trump and Melania stopped by the OTR with reporters.ÃÂ

It is not unusual for elected officials to hold off-the-record meetings with the press -- ostensibly to give journalists insight into the principalÃÂs thinking on an issue. This particular session took place as journalists continue to protest the fact that Mr. Trump has yet to hold a news conference since his election. ItÃÂs now been 145 days since his last news conference. He has, since the election, given interviews to CBS News, to New York Times reporters, and to Fox News, but the press conference he was to hold last week about the resolution of his business conflicts was postponed until the new year.  

Mike Allen, formerly of Politico and now of Axios, was there and sent a series of tweets about the meeting in the White and Gold ballroom, saying in one that Mr. Trump was ÃÂrelaxed and chattyÃÂ and that pictures were allowed of the off-the-record session.


Many of the journalists who attended, including Allen, saw an uptick in outraged tweets aimed at them, though this one, from cartoonist Ann Telnaes, summed up the reaction visually.

Three years before she met husband Donald Trump, Melania Trump was snapped in a nude frolic with another female model, bombshell photos obtained exclusively by The Post show.

Modal Trigger

The lesbian-themed pics are from a two-day photo shoot in Manhattan in 1995, when Melania Knauss, as she was called, was 25 years old and modeling under the name ÃÂMelania K.ÃÂ

(Photographer AlÃÂ© de BasseÃÂ­ville later told The Post that he misspoke, and the photo session actually took place in 1996 in Manhattan, and appeared in a 1997 issue of the magazine.)

Several were featured in Max Magazine, a now-defunct French menÃÂs monthly, more than 20 years ago. Others have never been in print ÃÂ until now.

The raciest of the photos shows Melania lying nude in a bed as Scandinavian model Emma Eriksson, also naked, embraces her from behind, just below her breasts, which are fully exposed.

In another photo, Eriksson wears sheer stockings, a low-cut bustier, high heels and a long robe ÃÂ all designed by John Galliano ÃÂ and raises a whip as if preparing to spank Melania, who pretends to recoil. Melania is more conservatively dressed in a skin-tight gown and high heels.

ÃÂI always loved women together, because I have been with a lot of women who desired the mÃÂ©nage ÃÂ  trois,ÃÂ said Jarl Ale de Basseville, the French fashion photographer who snapped the pictures.

ÃÂThis is beauty and not porn. I am always shocked by the porn industry because they are destroying the emotion and the essence of purity and simplicity.ÃÂ

Part of the shoot, which de Basseville said was inspired by Renaissance art, took place on the buildingÃÂs rooftop, said a fashion-industry insider who was present at one of the photo sessions.

Melania behaved ÃÂlike a true professionalÃÂ during one of the nighttime shoots with Eriksson, the source said.

ÃÂShe was charming throughout,ÃÂ said the source, adding that the picsÃÂ lesbian theme didnÃÂt faze her. ÃÂShe was always smiling, with a very pleasant personality and was polite and very well educated.ÃÂ


AlÃÂ© de BasseÃÂ­villePhoto: AlÃÂ© de BasseÃÂ­ville
Melania had recently arrived in the city from modeling stints in Paris and Milan at the time. In Gotham, she was booked for mostly commercial work and was later featured in an ad for Camel cigarettes, the source told The Post.

Her sexy photo spread appeared in the January 1996 issue of Max Magazine, whose cover featured a photo of supermodel Cindy Crawford.

In addition to the lesbian-themed shots, de Basseville took several nude pictures of Melania from different angles.

In one of them, Melania pouts at the camera while clad only in stilettos. In another, her back is to the camera, and her arms are raised as if up against a wall.

ÃÂI think it is important to show the beauty and freedom of the woman, and I am very proud of these pictures because they celebrate MelaniaÃÂs beauty, ÃÂÃÂ de Basseville said.

Asked about the photos, Donald Trump said: ÃÂMelania was one of the most successful models, and she did many photo shoots, including for covers and major magazines. This was a picture taken for a European magazine prior to my knowing Melania. In Europe, pictures like this are very fashionable and common.ÃÂ

The Slovenian-born beauty, now 46, first met Trump at a Fashion Week party in 1998. They married in January 2005 and have one son, Baron, 10.

She has modeled for Sports Illustrated and Vogue among other publications, posing for such top photographers as Helmut Newton and Mario Testino.

Since leaving the White House, Bossert has run a national security consulting business and served as a fellow at the Atlantic Council focusing on cybersecurity.

234	"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂCalling his action ÃÂlong overdue,ÃÂ President Barack Obama on Friday signed an executive order requiring that the President of the United States be a federal taxpayer.

The order, which makes a non-taxpayer ineligible to serve as President, goes into effect immediately.

ÃÂSince the President has such a large say in how federal taxes are spent, it only makes sense that he or she contribute to those taxes, too,ÃÂ he said, noting that everyone who has served as President has been a taxpayer.

The President urged people ÃÂnot to read too much into the timingÃÂ of his executive order. ÃÂIt just seemed like the right thing to do,ÃÂ he said.

ObamaÃÂs action drew howls of protest from Republicans on Capitol Hill, including the House Speaker, Paul Ryan. ÃÂThis is nothing less than an attack on the American dream of paying no taxes,ÃÂ Ryan said.

The President, who brushed off that criticism, is reportedly readying another executive order requiring cabinet members to have held at least a summer job relevant to their posts."	0
235	"(CNN)The Democratic National Convention kicked off Monday without its outgoing Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, following a chaotic scene at a morning meeting where she was loudly jeered by Bernie Sanders supporters.

""I have decided that in the interest of making sure that we can start the Democratic convention on a high note that I am not going to gavel in the convention,"" Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel newspaper in an interview.
Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who is also the Democratic National Committee's secretary, handled the gaveling instead.
""Delegates, alternatives, standing committee members and all of our honored Democrats and other guests here in Philadelphia and all of you who have joined us by television, radio and online, here in the United States and around the world,"" she said, ""I hereby call the 47th quadrennial Democratic National Convention to order.""
From Russia without love? DNC hack roils Philly
Wasserman Schultz will also not speak tonight or throughout the duration of the convention, a Democrat close to her says. She will remain in Philadelphia until Friday when she formally steps down as leader of the committee.
Wasserman Schultz changed her plans as the fallout deepened from leaked DNC emails that appeared to show the committee favoring presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Sanders during the primary. It became clear Monday that the convention floor could erupt in anger if she gaveled the convention into session or sought to speak.
And the Democratic National Committee issued an apology to Sanders moments after the convention opened, likely hoping to help soothe tensions heading into the week.
""On behalf of everyone at the DNC, we want to offer a deep and sincere apology to Sen. Sanders, his supporters, and the entire Democratic Party for the inexcusable remarks made over email,"" the statement said. ""These comments do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process. The DNC does not -- and will not -- tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates. Individual staffers have also rightfully apologized for their comments, and the DNC is taking appropriate action to ensure it never happens again.""
The morning Florida delegate meeting descended into chaos when Wasserman Schultz took the stage, with critics holding up signs with the word ""emails,"" and Sanders supporters booing the congresswoman loudly, even after she began speaking.
""We have to make sure that we move forward together in a unified way,"" Wasserman Schultz said during brief remarks. ""We know that the voices in this room that are standing up and being disruptive, we know that is not the Florida that we know. The Florida that we know is going to make sure that we continue to make jobs.""
The audience was roughly half supportive of Wasserman Schultz and half detractors, though the angry participants were louder than the other half. Those attendees began to chant, ""Shame! Shame! Shame!"" while Wasserman Schultz was speaking.
Sanders tried to quell some of his dissatisfied supporters at a rally before his expected speech Monday.
""We have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine,"" Sanders said, which prompted some attendees to shout him down.

Alternate plans
Wasserman Schultz announced Sunday she is stepping down as chairwoman of the DNC at the end of the party's convention. The drama reinforced concerns about Democratic party unity.
Former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver tried to show a unified Democratic Party on Monday, the morning after Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation.
""This happened, we knew it happened then, now is the time to go forward,' Weaver told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" on Monday. ""Now is the time to elect Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald Trump.""
Wasserman Schultz talked with both President Barack Obama and Clinton before making announcing her upcoming resignation, a Democratic source said.
""Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals [which include electing Clinton president] is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention,"" Wasserman Schultz said in the statement.
""As party chair, this week I will open and close the Convention and I will address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for Democrats, but for all Americans,"" she said.

DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile will serve as interim chair through the election. She had been a CNN political commentator, but CNN and Brazile have mutually agreed to suspend their contract, effective immediately, although she will remain on air during the convention week in an unpaid capacity, CNN said. CNN will revisit the contract once Brazile concludes her role.
Separately, a Democratic operative said Hispanic leaders close to Clinton and her high command were discussing Housing Secretary Julian Castro as a possible successor to Wasserman Schultz at the DNC helm, among a number of other candidates whose name are being mentioned.
Chants of ""Debbie is done!"" and ""Debbie resigned!"" broke out at a pro-Sanders rally Sunday in Philadelphia after the news was announced.
Party officials decided Saturday that Wasserman Schultz would not have a major speaking role or preside over daily convention proceedings this week. The DNC Rules Committee has named Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, as permanent chair of the convention, according to a DNC source. She will gavel each session to order and will gavel each session closed.
""She's been quarantined,"" another top Democrat said of Wasserman Schultz, following a meeting Saturday night but before her announcement that she was leaving.
Both sides of the aisle react
Obama issued a statement, saying, ""For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful.""
And Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz for her leadership of the party.
""I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year's historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week's events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,"" Clinton said.
After slamming Wasserman Schultz as ""highly overrated,"" Trump, speaking at a rally in Roanoke, Virginia, knocked Clinton for being disloyal to the soon-to-be former DNC chair.
""How about that for disloyalty in terms of Hillary Clinton. Because Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so much for Hillary Clinton,"" Trump said. ""These politicians. There's no loyalty there. No loyalty. None whatsoever.""
""It gets a little heat and they fire her,"" Trump said. ""Debbie was totally loyal to Hillary and Hillary threw her under a bus and it didn't take more than five minutes to make that decision.""
Wasserman's Republican counterpart, Reince Priebus, said, ""I think the day's events show really the uphill climb Democrats face this week.""
""The extreme left will not be satisfied by one person's resignation,"" the Republican party national chairman added.
Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz out the door.
""Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned over her failure to secure the DNC's email servers and the rigged system she set up with the Clinton campaign,"" he said in a statement. ""Now Hillary Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz's lead and drop out over her failure to safeguard top secret, classified information both on her unauthorized home server and while traveling abroad.""
DNC hack: What you need to know
Weaver called Wasserman Schultz's departure a win on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" on Sunday.
""I think what the signal was today is that the voices of Bernie Sanders supporters have been heard,"" he said. ""And other people, frankly, in the party, Hillary Clinton supporters, who felt this was the last straw, that she had to go, and this shows they have been heard and gives us opportunity to move forward toward November -- united to deal with the problem of Donald Trump.""
Wasserman Schultz's stewardship of the DNC has been under fire through most of the presidential primary process, but her removal from the convention stage comes following the release of nearly 20,000 emails.
One email appears to show DNC staffers asking how they can reference Sanders' faith to weaken him in the eyes of Southern voters. Another seems to depict an attorney advising the committee on how to defend Clinton against an accusation by the Sanders campaign of not living up to a joint fundraising agreement.

Before the announcement, Sanders on Sunday told Tapper the release of the DNC emails that show its staffers working against him underscores the position he's held for months: Wasserman Schultz needs to go.
""I don't think she is qualified to be the chair of the DNC, not only for these awful emails, which revealed the prejudice of the DNC, but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people and young people, and I don't think her leadership style is doing that,"" Sanders told Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.
""I am not an atheist,"" he said. ""But aside from all of that, it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign. It goes without saying: The function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates -- to be fair and even-minded.""
He added: ""But again, we discussed this many, many months ago, on this show, so what is revealed now is not a shock to me."""	0
236	"Don't expect to see Donald Trump give a humble concession speech if he loses the Republican presidential nomination.

During a Sunday rally in Maryland, the Republican presidential frontrunner mocked candidates who praise their opponents during concession speeches, saying that if he loses the contest, Americans will probably not hear much from him again.

""They fight like hell for six months, and they're saying horrible things, the worst things you can imagine,"" Trump said. ""And then one of them loses, one of them wins. And the one who loses says, 'I just want to congratulate my opponent. He is a brilliant man, he'll be a great governor or president or whatever.'""

He continued: ""I'm not sure you're ever going to see me there. I don't think I'm going to lose, but if I do, I don't think you're ever going to see me again, folks. I think I'll go to Turnberry and play golf or something.""

Trump's mockery wasn't relegated just to the electoral losers. He also said Sunday that the winners were too modest.

""Half the times [the winners] put them in the administration ÃÂ that's how they get rid of them,"" Trump said of the losing candidates.

This line of thought has not stopped Trump from graciously accepting endorsements from other candidates who have dropped out of the presidential race. Trump frequently touts his support from Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

During a news conference in February announcing Christie's endorsement, Trump lauded Christie's tenure as a governor and his barbs during the Republican presidential debates.

""Generally speaking, I'm not big on endorsements,"" Trump said, adding, ""This was an endorsement that really meant a lot."""	0
237	"Lou Dobbs focuses on the prominent role the month of March has played in the Clinton email and other scandals. He calls it ÃÂThe troublesome ides of March, especially March of last year. For a number of reasons that month has proven to be pivotal in the scandal over her use of a ÃÂprivateÃÂ server to conduct official State Department business, communicating by email over that server.ÃÂ

He points out that it was the New York Times that broke the email story back in March of 2015, with the latest batch of WikiLeaks emails indicating that the Clinton team has been scrambling ever since. Dobbs plays a clip of Obama lying about his knowledge of Clinton using a personal email account to conduct government business.ÃÂ

In an interview Obama was asked, ÃÂMr. ÃÂpresident,ÃÂ when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the US government for official business while she was Secretary of State?ÃÂ Obama responded with a blatant lie, saying, ÃÂThe same time everybody else learned it through news reports.ÃÂ

Mr. Dobbs points out the fact that ÃÂEverybody else, however, didnÃÂt believe the ÃÂpresidentÃÂ when he said that. And ClintonÃÂs top aide, Cheryl Mills, certainly knew better. It was she who told Podesta, ÃÂWe need to clean this up,ÃÂ noting the ÃÂpresidentÃÂ has emails from Hillary that do not say ÃÂState.gov.'ÃÂ

Dobbs goes on to tell his audience that Clinton had just days earlier conspired with Obama to hold back emails despite being subpoenaed by Congress. In that instance Podesta cities executive privilege. Dobbs points out that March was also when the firm managing her server, Platte River Networks, deleted her email archive using Bleachbit, despite that subpoena.ÃÂ

March was also the month that Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe suggested that the wife of a strategically placed FBI official run for the Virginia State Senate. He also donated $467,000 to her campaign and then promoted him to the number two position in the FBI, in charge of the Clinton ÃÂinvestigation.ÃÂ

Dobbs closes, saying, ÃÂAs I have always said, there are no coincidences when it comes to the Clintons, and these latest revelations show how far their corruption extends within our government in Washington DC."	1
238	"Ford has a message to Donald Trump: We're not going anywhere.
The automaker quickly shot down Donald Trump's latest hyperbolic claim, made on Fox News Thursday, that Ford plans to ""fire all its employees in the United States"" as part of a plan to build a plant in Mexico.
Ford said there will be zero job losses in the U.S. as a result of the new plant in Mexico. The Wayne, Michigan, plant that now builds the Focus and C-Max that will move to Mexico will instead start building other models -- probably the new Ford Bronco SUV and Ranger small pickup.
""Ford has been in the United States for more than 100 years. Our home is here. We will be here forever,"" said spokeswoman Christine Baker.
The company has 85,000 U.S. employees, up 28,000, or nearly 50%, in just the last five years. It has 8,800 employees at Mexican plants, and will add 2,800 jobs there when the new $1.6 billion plant opens there in 2018.
Ford committed to build new vehicles at the Michigan Assembly Plant to take the place of the Focus and C-Max when it reached a new contract late last year with the United Auto Workers union, which represents 3,900 hourly workers at the plant.
And while Ford is shifting production of all small cars to Mexico, it will continue to make many car models at U.S. plants, including the iconic Mustang.
Related: Ford moving all small car production to Mexico
The small cars Ford is shifting to Mexico are less popular and less profitable models.
Trump has been using Ford for months as a prime example of what's wrong with U.S. trade policy, but Ford has been strongly rebutting the GOP nominee.
The issue surfaced again on Wednesday when a Ford executive, speaking at a conference for investors, reiterated the company's plans to move its small car production to Mexico.
Related: 'President Trump' would cost U.S. economy $1 trillion
During a Fox News interview, Trump vowed to impose a 35% tax on cars built in Mexico if they're shipped back to the U.S.
""They think they're going to get away with this and they fire all their employees in the United States and...move to Mexico,"" said Trump.

239	"NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂSpeaking to reporters late Friday night, President-elect Donald Trump revealed that he had Googled Obamacare for the first time earlier in the day.

ÃÂI Googled it, and, I must say, I was surprised,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂThere was a lot in it that really made sense, to be honest.ÃÂ

He said that he regretted that the frenetic pace of the presidential campaign had prevented him from Googling Obamacare earlier. ÃÂYouÃÂre always running, running, running,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂThere were so many times that I made a mental note to Google Obamacare but I just never got around to it.ÃÂ

Trump also told the reporters that, now that the campaign was over, he had finally found the time to Google Mexico.

ÃÂReally eye-opening,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂA lot of the Mexicans are terrific. They do just terrific things.ÃÂ

When asked if Googling Mexico had affected his position on building a wall, Trump said, ÃÂQuite frankly, it did make me wonder a bit about that. A lot of these terrific Mexicans could come in and make a real contribution to our country and, in exchange, I think theyÃÂd really benefit from Obamacare.ÃÂ

240	"The famous drag queen, actor and recording artist Rupaul, claims that Donald Trump grabbed his ass and genitals during a party in 1995.

In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Rupaul said that Mr Trump ÃÂmade a moveÃÂ on him during an event celebrating the release of the movie To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar.

The artist was wearing his full drag queen apparel at the time, and he says Trump clearly mistook him for a real woman.

ÃÂI had just come out of the bathroom when Trump jumped on me and kissed meÃÂ, he explained. ÃÂHe started grabbing my ass and pulled my dress up to grab my genitals. He suddenly became very angry. He started yelling and cursing, and he left the party.ÃÂ


Rupaul says he was dressed ÃÂvery sexyÃÂ for the party and is convinced that Trump thought he was a woman.
Rupaul says he found Donald Trump attractive before this incident, but that he was shocked by his rudeness and vulgarity.

Rupaul told the Hollywood Inquirer that Donald Trump moved on him during a party, grabbing his ass and genitals.
ÃÂHe just wanted to use me as an object,ÃÂ he told Hollywood Inquirer. ÃÂIÃÂve never felt so dirty in my life! In a way, I was saved by the fact that IÃÂm a man.ÃÂ

This allegation from Rupaul adds to the wave of accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior concerning Donald Trump.

Many women have come forward over the last week to denounce the abusive groping and sexual harassment they suffered from Trump over the years.

The New York Times published an article earlier this week, in which TrumpsÃÂs alleged victims described the mistreatment they suffered.

All these allegations came after Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings from 2005 obtained by The Washington Post and NBC News.

The comments were part of a conversation with Billy Bush, then a host of the television show ÃÂAccess Hollywood.ÃÂ

The remarks were captured by a live microphone that Trump did not appear to know was recording their conversation.

ÃÂYou know IÃÂm automatically attracted to beautiful ÃÂ I just start kissing them. ItÃÂs like a magnet. Just kiss. I donÃÂt even wait,ÃÂ Trump said. ÃÂAnd when youÃÂre a star they let you do it. You can do anything.ÃÂ

He added: ÃÂGrab them by the pussy. You can do anything.ÃÂ

In RupaulÃÂs case, Trump seems to have been disappointed by what he discovered under the dress."	1

He was into all the kinky stuff like gagging the press, handcuffing immigrants, stop and frisk. Plus he had this whole prison fantasy with Hillary. But then he got over-the-top dirty ÃÂ pussy grabbing, blood coming out of her wherever, and, cÃÂmon, suggesting heÃÂd like to get it on with his daughter?

The election commission has an emergency meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to discuss a possible vote recount which will include the newly-found ballots.

Giuliani blamed the mainstream media for not properly informing the American people about the destruction and havoc Obama has wrought since his first day in office.

244	"Trump said that Obama had a hand in creating ISIS. Now that Donald Trump is the president-elect, Vladimir Putin, of all people, has confirmed this.

Putin said the Syrian rebels are mercenaries who only fight for whomever pays them more. While the president of Russia did not come out and say it is America arming them, he definitely, strongly hinted at it.



Of course, this is the type of flawed leadership we have come to expect under the Obama administration. PutinÃÂs strong words have also, sadly, been confirmed by other sources.

A Wikileaks report last August proved that Hillary actually lied under oath when she was asked about the weapons trade program that occurred with Syria starting a year before the Benghazi attacks. In the batch of leaked emails, an astonishing 17,000 of them were about Syria alone, as per The National Review.

Something tells me this isnÃÂt the type of ÃÂexperienceÃÂ that the Clinton team was going for when they were squaring off against Trump, but this is also solid verification of PutinÃÂs statement.

In ClintonÃÂs attempts to win what would essentially have been a third term for Obama, she would have contributed to the international discord and unrest we have all become painfully aware of.

LetÃÂs get something absolutely clear: in a world where America is not dominant on the world stage and where ISIS is allowed to grow stronger, those who love freedom lose. Those who believe in all our countryÃÂs wonderful principles would soon see them slip away.

The United States of America simply could not afford to have more of the same. We, and the rest of the world, could not afford to have the ISIS rebels grow stronger and more organized. In the midst of all this, Donald Trump began to throw out massive truth bombs, including that Obama and Clinton created ISIS by virtue of their policies. This seemed incredibly outrageous to liberals.

However, credit Trump for being bold enough to say it. This is definitely the type of leadership we need. There is no question it is a sad day in America when it is Vladimir Putin who sounds more like an American than even our own sitting president. Thankfully, weÃÂll soon have a true leader in the White House.

Trump then mentioned all the terrible deals that Sanders has been shouting about since he announced his campaign. He said that he would get rid of those deals in order to protect American workers. This is how Trump will save America. He will not sell us out.


The media has worked hard to stop people from seeing what has been happening, Trump has been pulling the disillusioned Democrats that have already seen the light. They see that the America is getting crapped on by the rest of the world.

*** ItÃÂs good to see that even hardcore Democrats hate Hillary Clinton as much as Trump Nation does.
One Bernie Supporter named Juanita Mae Ish Poloskey wrote the following on Facebook:

Another Bernie supporter wrote: ÃÂI and a bunch of Bernie supporters will be voting Trump this November. I refuse to vote for someone who sells the American people out to foreign entities.ÃÂ

That last comment received more than 8,751 likes in only a couple of hours.

Another Democrat named Mac Zeff wrote: ÃÂMy family hast traditionally been Democrats. We are voting TRUMP this time around. If Hillary is the best the Democrats can produce for the working class, its time to disband the Democrat party.ÃÂ

248	"Rex Tillerson, the businessman nominated by Donald Trump to be the next US secretary of state, was the long-time director of a US-Russian oil firm based in the tax haven of the Bahamas, leaked documents show.

Tillerson ÃÂ the chief executive of ExxonMobil ÃÂ became a director of the oil companyÃÂs Russian subsidiary, Exxon Neftegas, in 1998. His name ÃÂ RW Tillerson ÃÂ appears next to other officers who are based at Houston, Texas; Moscow; and Sakhalin, in RussiaÃÂs far east.


 Who is Donald TrumpÃÂs secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson?
The leaked 2001 document comes from the corporate registry in the Bahamas. It was one of 1.3m files given to the Germany newspaper SÃÂ¼ddeutsche Zeitung by an anonymous source. The registry is public but details of individual directors are typically incomplete or missing entirely. 

Though there is nothing untoward about this directorship, it has not been reported before and is likely to raise fresh questions over TillersonÃÂs relationship with Russia ahead of a potentially stormy confirmation hearing by the US senate foreign relations committee. Exxon said on Sunday that Tillerson was no longer a director after becoming the companyÃÂs CEO in 2006.

ExxonMobilÃÂs use of offshore regimes ÃÂ while legal ÃÂ may also jar with TrumpÃÂs avowal to put ÃÂAmerica firstÃÂ.

TillersonÃÂs critics say he is too close to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and that his appointment could raise potential conflicts of interest.

ExxonMobil is the worldÃÂs largest oil company and has for a long time been eyeing RussiaÃÂs vast oil and gas deposits. Tillerson currently has Exxon stock worth more than $200m.


Since his nomination, TillersonÃÂs Russia ties have become a source of bipartisan concern. In 2013, Putin awarded him the Russian Order of Friendship. Tillerson is close to Igor Sechin, the head of Russian state oil company Rosneft and the de facto second most powerful figure inside the Kremlin. A hardliner, Sechin is ex-KGB.

TillersonÃÂs award followed a 2011 deal between ExxonMobil and Rosneft to explore the Kara Sea, in RussiaÃÂs Arctic.

It was put on hold in 2014 after the Obama administration imposed wide-ranging sanctions against Russia. The sanctions were punishment for PutinÃÂs Crimea annexation that spring and RussiaÃÂs undercover invasion of eastern Ukraine.

The ban covers the US sharing of sophisticated offshore and shale oil technology. Exxon was supposed to halt its drilling with Rosneft. The firm successfully pleaded with the US Treasury department to delay the ban by a few weeks, with the Kremlin threatening to seize its rig. In this brief window Exxon discovered a major Arctic field with some 750m barrels of new oil.

Tillerson has criticised the US governmentÃÂs policy on Russia. In 2014 he told ExxonÃÂs annual meeting that ÃÂwe do not support sanctionsÃÂ. He added: ÃÂWe always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who they are really harming.ÃÂ

It is widely assumed by investors that the new Trump administration will drop sanctions. This would allow the Kara joint venture to resume, boosting ExxonÃÂs share price and yielding potential profits in the tens of billions of dollars. According to company records, Tillerson currently owns $218m of stock. His Exxon pension is worth about $70m.

The Senate foreign relations committee is currently split 10 to 9 between Republicans and Democrats. But several heavyweight Republicans, including John McCain, have raised doubts about TillersonÃÂs nomination and his lack of experience to be AmericaÃÂs top diplomat after four decades spent exclusively in the oil industry.

Republican senator Marco Rubio ÃÂ who sits on the committee ÃÂ said on Tuesday that he had ÃÂserious concernsÃÂ about giving Tillerson the job. Rubio praised him as a ÃÂrespected businessmanÃÂ but said that the next secretary of state ÃÂmust be someone who views the world with moral clarity [and who] has a clear sense of AmericaÃÂs interestsÃÂ.

Tillerson is likely to get rid of his Exxon stock if the narrowly Republican-majority Senate confirms his appointment.

Controversy over his links with Russia comes at a time when the topic is politically red hot, after the CIA said earlier this month that Kremlin hackers had stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats in order to help Trump. The president-elect has dismissed the CIAÃÂs assessment, calling it ÃÂridiculousÃÂ. The Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, says Putin targeted her for reasons of personal revenge.

As well as on oil and gas, the Obama administration has imposed personal sanctions on PutinÃÂs friends, including Sechin. Sechin has said that one of his ambitions is to ÃÂride the roads in the United States on motorcycles with TillersonÃÂ. Currently, Sechin is forbidden from entering the country.

This new revelation about TillersonÃÂs directorship sheds light on the use by multinational companies of contrived offshore structures, now under scrutiny following AprilÃÂs massive Panama Papers leak.

Exxon NeftegasÃÂs most important oil and gas project is Sakhalin-1. It is located in the sub-Arctic, off the frozen and difficult-to-access north-east coast of RussiaÃÂs Sakhalin island. This is 10,700km (6,650 miles) away from the subsidiaryÃÂs official business home in Nassau, the semi-tropical capital of the Bahamas. The Bahamas is notorious for secrecy and has a corporate tax rate of zero.

The documents from the Bahamas corporate registry were shared by SÃÂ¼ddeutsche Zeitung with the Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC. They show that Exxon registered at least 67 companies in the secretive tax haven, covering operations in countries from Russia to Venezuela to Azerbaijan.

Exxon Neftegas features in about 25 leaked offshore documents. The oil firm was incorporated in 1998 by a law firm in Nassau, Higgs & Johnson. Another veteran law firm, Lobosky Management Ltd, subsequently took over as registered agent. The company secretary, Sophia Kishinevsky, signed the paperwork and made annual filings.

Exxon said it had no comment on whether Tillerson should now divest his Exxon holdings and resign from his positions with all Exxon entities. It said the oil firm had incorporated some of its affiliates in the Bahamas because of ÃÂsimplicity and predictabilityÃÂ.

ÃÂIt is not done to reduce tax in the country where the company operates,ÃÂ Exxon said. ÃÂIncorporation of a company in the Bahamas does not decrease ExxonMobilÃÂs tax liability in the country where the entity generates its income.ÃÂ

The firm was one of the largest taxpayers in the world, with an effective global tax rate in 2015 of 34%, it said. Its effective tax rate over the past three years ÃÂ 2013, 2014, 2015 ÃÂ was 43%, it added. This compared favourably with other Fortune 100 companies, which ÃÂhave substantially lower effective tax rates than ExxonMobilÃÂ."	0
249	"MOSCOW ÃÂ A travel weary Kevin OÃÂLeary arrived in RussiaÃÂs capital this morning in order to ask President Vladimir Putin for assistance becoming Tory leader and then PM of Canada, just like Putin helped Trump.

ÃÂWhatever you want, whatever you need,ÃÂ said OÃÂLeary as he kissed PutinÃÂs feet. ÃÂState secrets, control over the arctic? ItÃÂs done.ÃÂ

ÃÂJust do the same thing for me that you did for him.ÃÂ

OÃÂLeary is reportedly hoping Putin will use Russian espionage and hacking networks to convince Canadians that Maxime BernierÃÂs recent trip to Thailand was for immoral purposes, and that Justin Trudeau was responsible for the Benghazi attacks.

ÃÂI also want Dragons Den cancelled, and for the media to say the show would have stayed on the air if they hadnÃÂt fired me.ÃÂ

Putin mostly stayed silent during the twenty minute meeting. However at the end he did pull out his ceremonial blade and advise OÃÂLeary that, if he truly wants PutinÃÂs help, he must ÃÂwear the mark.ÃÂ

Upon his departure, OÃÂLeary was dismayed to find a grinning Kellie Leitch waiting next in line at PutinÃÂs office."	0
250	"Newt Gingrich has been waging an INSANE jihad against Donald Trump over the Mexican Judge comments made earlier in the week. Many people are going to be disappointed by this, but Newt flipped sides because of the money.

The mainstream media reported earlier last month that Sheldon Adelson was willing to contribute $100 million to TrumpÃÂs campaign. It was not reported much, but there was another $100 million that was offered to Trump if he picked Newt Gingrich. ThatÃÂs why Gingrich was so nice to Trump.



When Trump the entire offer.declined the entire offer. Gingrich started lashing out at him publicly. He even recently claimed that the comments Trump made about the judge were ÃÂone of his worst mistakes.ÃÂ All Trump did was point out publicly that the Trump University lawyer has ties to the La Raza Hispanic nationalist organization.

ÃÂI DONÃÂT KNOW WHAT TRUMPÃÂS REASONING WAS, AND I DONÃÂT CARE,ÃÂ GINGRICH TOLD THE WASHINGTON POST.

What a traitor. ItÃÂs hard to see it happen because a lot of people were hoping that Newt would be the VP. It is now showing that he is just bitter for having Trump change his mind.

ItÃÂs in TrumpÃÂs best interest to pick someone that identifies with him ideologically as his VP. This makes a lot of sense because Gingrich has done an almost complete 180 since last week. But, we shouldnÃÂt be too torn up about it ÃÂ remember that Newt Gingrich wanted a moon base at one point.



*** Bye, Bye, Newt. Have fun as the leader of the moon. YouÃÂll probably see the wall from there."	1
251	"CLEVELAND ÃÂ Avik Roy is a RepublicanÃÂs Republican. A health care wonk and editor at Forbes, he has worked for three Republican presidential hopefuls ÃÂ Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and Marco Rubio. Much of his adult life has been dedicated to advancing the Republican Party and conservative ideals.

But when I caught up with Roy at a bar just outside the Republican convention, he said something IÃÂve never heard from an establishment conservative before: The Grand Old Party is going to die.

ÃÂI donÃÂt think the Republican Party and the conservative movement are capable of reforming themselves in an incremental and gradual way,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂThereÃÂs going to be a disruption.ÃÂ

Roy isnÃÂt happy about this: He believes it means the Democrats will dominate national American politics for some time. But he also believes the Republican Party has lost its right to govern, because it is driven by white nationalism rather than a true commitment to equality for all Americans.

ÃÂUntil the conservative movement can stand up and live by that principle, it will not have the moral authority to lead the country,ÃÂ he told me.

This is a standard assessment among liberals, but it is frankly shocking to hear from a prominent conservative thinker. Our conversation had the air of a confessional: of Roy admitting that he and his intellectual comrades had gone wrong, had failed, had sinned.

His history of conservatism was a Greek tragedy. It begins with a fatal error in 1964, survived on the willful self-delusion of people like Roy himself, and ended with Donald Trump.

ÃÂI think the conservative movement is fundamentally broken,ÃÂ Roy tells me. ÃÂTrump is not a random act. This election is not a random act.ÃÂ

The conservative movementÃÂs founding error: Barry Goldwater

In 1955, William F. Buckley created the intellectual architecture of modern conservatism by founding National Review, focusing on a free market, social conservatism, and a muscular foreign policy. BuckleyÃÂs ideals found purchase in the Republican Party in 1964, with the nomination of Barry Goldwater. While Goldwater lost the 1964 general election, his ideas eventually won out in the GOP, culminating in the Reagan Revolution of 1980.

Normally, GoldwaterÃÂs defeat is spun as a story of triumph: how the conservative movement eventually righted the ship of an unprincipled GOP. But according to Roy, itÃÂs the first act of a tragedy.

ÃÂGoldwaterÃÂs nomination in 1964 was a historical disaster for the conservative movement,ÃÂ Roy tells me, ÃÂbecause for the ensuing decades, it identified Democrats as the party of civil rights and Republicans as the party opposed to civil rights.ÃÂ

ÃÂTHE GRAVITATIONAL CENTER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS WHITE NATIONALISMÃÂ
Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He himself was not especially racist ÃÂ he believed it was wrong, on free market grounds, for the federal government to force private businesses to desegregate. But this ÃÂprincipledÃÂ stance identified the GOP with the pro-segregation camp in everyoneÃÂs eyes, while the Democrats under Lyndon Johnson became the champions of anti-racism.

This had a double effect, Roy says. First, it forced black voters out of the GOP. Second, it invited in white racists who had previously been Democrats. Even though many Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act in Congress, the post-Goldwater party became the party of aggrieved whites.

ÃÂThe fact is, today, the Republican coalition has inherited the people who opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ÃÂ the Southern Democrats who are now Republicans,ÃÂ Roy says. ÃÂConservatives and Republicans have not come to terms with that problem.ÃÂ

Conservative intellectuals were blind to the truth about the GOP ÃÂ hence Trump

The available evidence compiled by historians and political scientists suggests that 1964 really was a pivotal political moment, in exactly the way Roy describes.

Yet Republican intellectuals have long denied this, fabricating a revisionist history in which Republicans were and always have been the party of civil rights. In 2012, National Review ran a lengthy cover story arguing that the standard history recounted by Roy was ÃÂpopular but indefensible.ÃÂ

This revisionism, according to Roy, points to a much bigger conservative delusion: They cannot admit that their partyÃÂs voters are motivated far more by white identity politics than by conservative ideals.

ÃÂConservative intellectuals, and conservative politicians, have been in kind of a bubble,ÃÂ Roy says. ÃÂWeÃÂve had this view that the voters were with us on conservatism ÃÂ philosophical, economic conservatism. In reality, the gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism.ÃÂ

Conservative intellectuals, for the most part, are horrified by racism. When they talk about believing in individual rights and equality, they really mean it. Because the Republican Party is the vehicle through which their ideas can be implemented, they need to believe that the party isnÃÂt racist.

So they deny the partyÃÂs racist history, that its post-1964 success was a direct result of attracting whites disillusioned by the DemocratsÃÂ embrace of civil rights. And they deny that to this day, Republican voters are driven more by white resentment than by a principled commitment to the free market and individual liberty.

ÃÂItÃÂs the power of wishful thinking. None of us want to accept that opposition to civil rights is the legacy that weÃÂve inherited,ÃÂ Roy says.

He expands on this idea: ÃÂItÃÂs a common observation on the left, but itÃÂs an observation that a lot of us on the right genuinely believed wasnÃÂt true ÃÂ which is that conservatism has become, and has been for some time, much more about white identity politics than it has been about conservative political philosophy. I think today, even now, a lot of conservatives have not come to terms with that problem.ÃÂ

This, Roy believes, is where the conservative intellectual class went astray. By refusing to admit the truth about their own party, they were powerless to stop the forces that led to Donald TrumpÃÂs rise. They told themselves, over and over again, that GoldwaterÃÂs victory was a triumph.

But in reality, it created the conditions under which Trump could thrive. TrumpÃÂs politics of aggrieved white nationalism ÃÂ labeling black people criminals, Latinos rapists, and Muslims terrorists ÃÂ succeeded because the partyÃÂs voting base was made up of the people who once opposed civil rights.

ÃÂ[Trump] tapped into something that was latent in the Republican Party and conservative movement ÃÂ but a lot of people in the conservative movement didnÃÂt notice,ÃÂ Roy concludes, glumly.

For conservatism to live, the conservative movement has to die

Over beers, I ask Roy how he feels about all of this personally. His answer is very sad.

ÃÂWhen Marco [Rubio] lost, I went through the five stages of grief. It was tough. I had to spend some time thinking about what to do for the next several years of my life,ÃÂ he says.

ÃÂI left a comforting and rewarding career as a biotech investor to do this kind of work. I did it because I felt it was important, and I care about the country. Maybe itÃÂs cheesy to say that, but I really sincerely do,ÃÂ he continues. ÃÂSo then, okay, what do I do? Do I do the same things IÃÂve been doing for the last four years? To me, just to do that to collect a paycheck didnÃÂt make a lot of sense.ÃÂ

This soul-searching led Roy to an uncomfortable conclusion: The Republican Party, and the conservative movement that propped it up, is doomed.

Both are too wedded to the politics of white nationalism to change how they act, but that just isnÃÂt a winning formula in a nation thatÃÂs increasingly black and brown. Either the Republican Party will eat itself or a new party will rise and overtake its voting share.

ÃÂEither the disruption will come from the Republican Party representing cranky old white people and a new right-of-center party emerging in its place, or a third party will emerge, ÃÂ  la the Republicans emerging from the Whigs in the [1850s],ÃÂ Roy says.

The work of conservative intellectuals today, he argues, is to devise a new conservatism ÃÂ a political vision that adheres to limited government principles but genuinely appeals to a more diverse America.

ÃÂI think itÃÂs incredibly important to take stock,ÃÂ he says, ÃÂand build a new conservative movement that is genuinely about individual liberty.ÃÂ

I donÃÂt know how this would work. I donÃÂt think Roy knows either.

For the entire history of modern conservatism, its ideals have been wedded to and marred by white supremacism. ThatÃÂs RoyÃÂs own diagnosis, and I think itÃÂs correct. As a result, we have literally no experience in America of a politically viable conservative movement unmoored from white supremacy.

IÃÂve read dozens of conservative intellectuals writing compellingly about non-racist conservative ideals. Writers like Andrew Sullivan, Ross Douthat, Reihan Salam, Michael Brendan Dougherty, and too many others to count have put forward visions of a conservative party quite different from the one we have.

But not one of these writers, smart as they are, has been able to explain what actual political constituency could bring about this pure conservatism in practice. The fact is that limited government conservatism is not especially appealing to nonwhite Americans, whereas liberalism and social democracy are. The only ones for whom conservatism is a natural fit are RoyÃÂs ÃÂcranky old white peopleÃÂ ÃÂ and theyÃÂre dying off.

Maybe Roy and company will be able to solve this problem. I hope they do. America needs a viable, intellectually serious right-of-center party.

Because we now know what the alternative looks like. ItÃÂs Donald Trump.

252	"President-elect Donald J. Trump received backlash from Democrats and members of the intelligence community on Thursday when it came to light that he engaged in a ninety-minute Skype video session last weekend with North KoreaÃÂs Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. Trump described the unprecedented discussion ÃÂ which critics have called a clear violation of U.S. protocol ÃÂ as ÃÂextraordinary,ÃÂ saying the North Korean dictator appeared to be in very good health.

ÃÂWe had a wonderful conversation,ÃÂ the former reality TV star said of Kim. ÃÂHeÃÂs very different from the way heÃÂs portrayed by the media and, you know, thatÃÂs something I can relate to.ÃÂ Trump said he was surprised by exactly how much he and the Supreme Leader have in common. ÃÂWe both love meatloaf,ÃÂ Trump exclaimed. ÃÂHe said he eats it all the time. I said ÃÂYou ought to come to New York, IÃÂll give you the best meatloaf youÃÂve ever had in your life.ÃÂ

Aside from sharing a love of baked ground meat, Trump and his North Korean counterpart discussed a wide range of issues including the economy, nuclear proliferation, and the reunification of North and South Korea. Trump, who repeatedly made the assertion during his campaign that more countries should have nuclear weapons, said he was willing to look into the possibility of loosening certain sanctions against the North Korean regime that might hinder the progress of its nuclear program. ÃÂIf they had that nuclear threat, IÃÂm sure it would be very good thing in terms of helping to unify the Korean peninsula,ÃÂ the president-elect said.

For his part, Mr. Trump said he offered praise for North KoreaÃÂs single-party political system. ÃÂI told him it was a very impressive thing to have such a successful political party that has lasted so long in that country.ÃÂ During his nearly two-hour long conversation with the Supreme Leader, Mr. Trump expressed an interest in implementing a similar single-party system in the United States as part of his effort to unite the country. ÃÂI think it would be very good thing to have,ÃÂ said Trump, adding, ÃÂYouÃÂd see a change in this country like you wouldnÃÂt believe.ÃÂ

Vice president-elect Mike Pence, who heads TrumpÃÂs transition team, described the ninety-minute Skype session as ÃÂvery casual,ÃÂ telling The New York Times that itÃÂs not unusual for world leaders to reach out following an election. ÃÂThis was the elected leader of the Democratic PeopleÃÂs Republic of Korea ÃÂ a democracy very similar to ours ÃÂ offering his congratulations and good wishes,ÃÂ the vice president-elect explained. Mr. Pence said he believes the call will have ÃÂlittle to no impactÃÂ on U.S.-South Korean relations."	1
253	"Tired and frustrated after spending so much time dealing with a bitterly divided Congress that needlessly created self-inflicted wounds to the U.S. economy, President Obama has begun to privately weigh the personal benefits of losing the 2012 presidential election. However, as the Republican field takes form, he is increasingly concerned that the number of weak candidates could force him to remain in the nationÃÂs worst job whether he wants to or not.

One of the more difficult challenges for Obama would be losing to Texas Governor Rick Perry, who is currently considered co-frontrunner for the nomination. With a slew of controversial remarks ÃÂ including statements about the unconstitutionality of Medicare and Social Security, as well as a proposal for seceding his state from the country he seeks to lead ÃÂ a Perry nomination would all but guarantee that the President will be stuck dealing with the 534 most difficult people in America for another four years.

Realizing that even with a dismal sub-forty-percent approval rating, he is still favored to win re-election, President Obama has decided to consult Senator John Kerry and former Vice President Al Gore, the two men who know more than anyone else about losing presidential elections to unqualified Texas governors.

ÃÂItÃÂs all about doing everything you can to show the American people you know nothing about what theyÃÂre dealing with,ÃÂ says former president-elect Al Gore. ÃÂIf the President talks about jobs while his opponents talk about tax cuts, that will make him look sensible. He needs to start talking more about why his opponents are weirdos or crazy people if he is seriously considering losing this thing.ÃÂ

ÃÂI think his problem is heÃÂs too consistent,ÃÂ said Mr. Kerry. As an example, Kerry cited the presidentÃÂs Afghanistan policy. ÃÂHe is doing exactly what he said he would do when he ran for president: focusing more troops fighting al Qaeda in the place they actually attacked us from. ItÃÂs ridiculous to do the same thing you said you would four years ago if you want to lose that job. Instead he should bow to his critics on the left and withdraw immediately.ÃÂ

ÃÂNot really looking like you want the job and failing to communicate why your opponent is dangerously incompetent are also tried-and-true techniques,ÃÂ added Gore. ÃÂHeÃÂs off to a good start there, no question.ÃÂ

To keep his options open if he decides he wants another term but ends up competing against the most threatening of the GOP contenders, President Obama has begun consulting members of BushÃÂs 2004 re-election campaign as well. When a reporter asked one of the courted staffers why the Obama campaign was interested, he replied he and his team ÃÂhave extensive experience working for an incumbent with terrible approval ratings while campaigning against a flip-flopper from Massachusetts.ÃÂ"	0
254	"The International Association of Firefighters, the main union representing American firefighters, has placed itself on a collision course with the AFL-CIO in the race for the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee, deciding to back Labor Secretary Tom Perez over Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison.

The Democratic leadership contest has taken on unusual significance in the wake of Hillary Clinton's devastating loss last month, dividing the labor movement between two Democrats whom it has long seen as allies.

The AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 unions that includes the IAFF, endorsed Ellison just before Perez entered the race last week, despite protests from IAFF President Harold Schaitberger and others.

In a statement, Schaitberger praised Perez as a ""a tireless advocate for civil and human rights"" who can transcend what the union president called ""a narrow focus on identity and cultural politics that alienated"" some longtime Democrats from the party.

""Tom Perez is the person who has the right mix of personal background, progressive values, experience and total commitment to all workers, in all regions and states across the country,"" Schaitberger said. ""To have Tom Perez as the Chair of one of our nation's two major political parties would be a significant victory for workers across America.""

Perez, the son of Dominican immigrants, has been leaning on his heritage to appeal to Latino DNC members. But Schaitberger, whose union is on the conservative end of the spectrum, said the Labor Secretary is the best person to reorient the party around ""a strong economic message that is truly inclusive of everyone.""

Ellison, an African-American convert to Islam who supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary, has faced questions over past associations with Nation of Islam founder Louis Farrakhan, whom he long ago disowned.

Schaitberger earlier spoke out against the AFL-CIO's endorsement process, which gave its executive committee members only three options: Vote to endorse Ellison, abstain, or make no endorsement.

That vote was an attempt to present a united front from the labor movement, which is well represented among the voting members of the DNC, and to avoid a damaging intraparty squabble.

But the IAFF is the second major union in the AFL-CIO to back Perez, and more defections may come.

On Friday, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union ÃÂ one of the country's largest unions, with 1.3 million members ÃÂ came out in support of the labor secretary, saying its members ""saw firsthand his passion and commitment"" to their issues during his work heading the Department of Labor.

Another union, the United Farm Workers, endorsed Perez on Monday. Their membership is small, but the endorsement comes with a symbolic connection to famed labor leader Cesar Chavez, who founded the union.

""He has been a lifelong friend of labor and immigrants. When farm workers needed him, Tom Perez stood up and fought,"" said UFW President Arturo Rodriguez, noting it was the first time the union has ever endorsed in a DNC chair race. ""He played a key role in helping farm workers in California win the same overtime pay protections as all other workers, and in doing so is helping end 78 years of race-based discrimination.""

However, Ellison has the backing of a number of powerful individual unions in addition to the AFL-CIO, including two of the very biggest: The American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Their support was a coup for Ellison not only because of their size, but because both were active Clinton allies, an important point as Ellison works to expand his support beyond his base among Sanders supporters.

The election for DNC chair will be held in February during a party meeting in Atlanta, but will feature a series of regional forums where candidates will discuss their platforms before then."	0
255	"Some time ago, Hillary Clinton and her advisers decided that the best course of action was to apologize for having used a personal email address to conduct government business while serving as secretary of state. Clinton herself was, clearly, not really all that remorseful about this, and it showed in her early efforts to address it. Eventually aides prevailed upon her to express a greater degree of regret, which they hoped would lay the issue to rest.

It did not. Instead, email-related talk has dogged Clinton throughout the election and it has influenced public perceptions of her in an overwhelmingly negative way. July polling showed 56 percent of Americans believed Clinton broke the law by relying on a personal email address with another 36 percent piling on to say the episode showed ÃÂbad judgmentsÃÂ albeit not criminality.

Because Clinton herself apologized for it and because it does not appear to be in any way important, Clinton allies, surrogates, and co-partisans have largely not familiarized themselves with the details of the matter, instead saying vaguely that it was an error of judgment and she apologized and America has bigger fish to fry.

This has had the effect of further inscribing and reinscribing the notion that Clinton did something wrong, meaning that every bit of micro-news that puts the scandal back on cable amounts to reminding people of something bad that Clinton did. In total, network newscasts have, remarkably, dedicated more airtime to coverage of ClintonÃÂs emails than to all policy issues combined.

This is unfortunate because emailgate, like so many Clinton pseudo-scandals before it, is bullshit. The real scandal here is the way a story that was at best of modest significance came to dominate the US presidential election ÃÂ overwhelming stories of much more importance, giving the American people a completely skewed impression of one of the two nominees, and creating space for the FBI to intervene in the election in favor of its apparently preferred candidate in a dangerous way.

Why Hillary Clinton used a personal email account
When Hillary Clinton took office as secretary of state, she, like most people, already had a personal email account. Like most people who started a federal job in 2009, she was also disheartened to learn that the then-current state of federal IT departments was such that she could not connect her personal smartphone to a State Department email address. If she wanted ready access to both her email accounts, she would need to carry two smartphones.

As any reporter in Washington knows, this indignity was in fact visited upon a huge number of DC denizens for many years. Everyone working in government felt that this was kinda bullshit, but nobody could really do anything about it. (Meanwhile, Chief Justice John Roberts has opined that carrying two phones could be reasonable grounds to suspect someone is a drug dealer.)

Clinton decided to do something about it. Namely, she told her top aides to just email her at her personal address so she could keep using whichever devices she wanted. This violated an internal State Department policy directive, known as a Foreign Affairs Manual, which stated that while it was okay to use personal digital devices to do work occasionally, ÃÂnormal day-to-day operationsÃÂ should be conducted on standard State Department equipment. Clinton chose to ignore this guideline and because she was the boss nobody could stop her. Career foreign service officers and other State personnel have every right to be peeved that Clinton opted out of an annoying policy rather than fixing the underlying issue, but itÃÂs hardly a matter of overwhelming public concern.

And, indeed, it turns out Colin Powell also used a private email address for routine work. Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine Albright didnÃÂt use email, and back before Albright only weird nerds even knew what email was. So at the time Clinton took office, only one previous secretary of state had ever faced the question of what email account to use, and he reached the exact same conclusion Clinton did ÃÂ just use your personal email address.

Why Hillary used a private email server
When Hillary tried the eminently sensible ÃÂI was following precedentÃÂ defense, Politifact dinged her answer as ÃÂmostly falseÃÂ on the grounds that while Powell did use a personal email account, he didnÃÂt use a private email server.

This distinction has attracted a lot of attention. And itÃÂs proven politically damaging ÃÂ because while lots of people maintain two email addresses and sometimes do work stuff on their personal email, very few Americans use a private email server as opposed to relying on a commercial email service. But legally speaking, this is completely irrelevant. As the State Department inspector general concluded in its report on ClintonÃÂs conduct, the guideline Clinton violated was a principle that ÃÂnormal day-to-day operations should be conducted on an authorized Automated Information System.ÃÂ

Using a private server violates that rule, but so would using a Gmail address or simply checking your State.gov email address from your personal laptop rather than a Department-issue one.

But while the use of a private server is legally irrelevant, itÃÂs certainly unusual. And it leaves people wondering: Why did Clinton go out of her way to set up a private server?

Clinton, as you may have heard, is married to former president Bill Clinton, who stepped down from office in January of 2001. Clinton was in the White House throughout the 1990s when the rest of us were being bombarded with AOL signup CD-ROMs, so he didnÃÂt have a personal email when he left. Gmail didnÃÂt exist back then, and his new job was, in effect, running a Bill Clinton startup. He launched a charitable foundation, he established his presidential library, and he made big bucks on speaking tours. He had a staff and he needed IT infrastructure and support. So he paid a guy to set up an email server that he could use.

Hillary Clinton ÃÂ who is, again, his wife ÃÂ also set herself up with an account on the same server. This is a bit unusual, but a lot about being married to a former president is unusual. What itÃÂs not is suspicious.

The private server was not a transparency dodge
ItÃÂs become a bit of an article of faith among journalists frustrated with public officialsÃÂ constant FOIA-dodging that this is all obviously dissimulation and Clinton was really trying to evade the Freedom of Information Act.

Many people, for example, point to the fact that Clinton would routinely travel with multiple digital devices as debunking her supposed convenience argument. But this is silly. IÃÂve been known to travel with an iPhone, an iPad, a Kindle, and a laptop all at once. That doesnÃÂt mean needing to carry two separate iPhones (one to check my work email and one to check my personal email) wouldnÃÂt be inconvenient. After all, what if I was replying to a work email while a text came in to my personal phone and I wanted to check it.

IÃÂd be left juggling phones and looking like an idiot, exactly how federal employees tended to look in the heyday of the double-fisting phones era.

I would not want to do that. Colin Powell did not want to do that. Hillary Clinton did not want to do that. Because that would be terrible.

By contrast, itÃÂs a terrible solution to a desire to avoid having your emails disclosed to the public via FOIA. One way you can tell itÃÂs a terrible solution is that Hillary ClintonÃÂs work emails have been disclosed to the public. You can read them right here.

The specific timeline is that the House Select Committee on Benghazi requested ClintonÃÂs emails in the summer of 2014, at which point the relevant State Department personnel realized they did not have the emails because Clinton had been using her personal address. State asked Clinton for the emails, and she handed them over later that year. It was only in March of 2015 that the New York Times broke the story of ClintonÃÂs personal email account in a scoop by Michael Schmidt (the server was reported a few days later by the AP)*, which reported that the emails had been handed over to the State Department ÃÂtwo months ago.ÃÂ

This is fairly clearly not an optimal approach to government record-keeping, as Thomas Blanton of the National Security Archive at George Washington University told Schmidt at the time:

ItÃÂs a shame it didnÃÂt take place automatically when she was secretary of state as it should have. Someone in the State Department deserves credit for taking the initiative to ask for the records back. Most of the time it takes the threat of litigation and embarrassment.
According to the Inspector GeneralÃÂs report, Clinton ÃÂshould have preserved any Federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing those records with the related files in the Office of the Secretary.ÃÂ

There are two possible interpretations here. One is that Clinton hatched the private email account plan as an elaborate dodge of federal record-keeping laws, but then months before the public became aware of the serverÃÂs existence complied with requests to turn them over. The other is that the federal records rule on the book was antiquated and a bit absurd, requiring officials to turn over paper copies of emails for no good reason, and simply got ignored out of sloppiness.

But she deleted 33,000 emails!
Suspicion at this point is then supposed to focus on the fact that she had her lawyers delete more than 30,000 emails from her server.

After Hillary left office, the State Department told her she had to turn all her work-related emails over to them, so she tasked a legal team with determining which emails were work emails and which were not. She turned the work emails over because thatÃÂs what she was legally required to do. She deleted the others, presumably because she did not want Trey Gowdy and Jason Chaffetz to rummage through her inbox leaking whatever they happened to find amusing to area journalists.

Now, is it possible that ClintonÃÂs legal team simply decided to entirely disregard the law and delete work-related emails?

In some sense, sure. But thereÃÂs no evidence that this happened. Generally speaking, in life we assume it would be moderately difficult to hire a well-known law firm to destroy evidence for you without someone deciding to do the right thing and squeal.

Besides which, it would be almost comically easy to catch Clinton in the act of systematically destroying relevant emails. The vast majority of the work-related email correspondence of an incumbent secretary of state, after all, is going to be correspondence with other government employees. Maybe she shoots a note to the Pentagon about Benghazi, or circulates ideas for a speech draft with her communications team. Any message like that, by definition, would exist on a government server as well as on her private one. This means it would be fully accessible via FOIA and also means that if ClintonÃÂs copy were found to not be in the pile of emails she turned over, sheÃÂd be caught red handed.

The available FOIA workarounds are available to everyone
Now whatÃÂs true is that Clinton could, in theory, have conducted work-related email conversations using another personÃÂs personal email address.

She could, for instance, have emailed Jake Sullivan on his Gmail address then deleted the email from her private server. WeÃÂd be in the dark and sheÃÂd get away with it.

The key thing to note here, however, is that the availability of this option has nothing to do with ClintonÃÂs decision to use a personal account as her exclusive account and also has nothing to do with her decision to host her personal email on a private server.

At any given time, any federal employee can use her personal account to email any other federal employee at his personal account. If they receive a Freedom of Information Act request, they are legally obligated to hand that correspondence over. But in a practical sense, if they want to break the law they can probably get away with it. And as Ezra Klein has noted, there are a lot of workarounds here:

As every reporter knows, when official sources want to tell you something particularly delicate, they email you from a personal account ÃÂ or, much more often, they call.

A lot of my reporting happens by email. But virtually none of my reporting with the White House happens by email. There, emails for clarification, or comment, quickly lead to phone calls. The reason ÃÂ unsaid but obvious ÃÂ is that phone calls don't leave an official record. White House officials can talk freely on the phone in a way they can't over email.

Similarly, the White House keeps a visitor's log. If you make an appointment to meet with someone, your entrance and point of contact are recorded for posterity and searchable online. When someone who shouldn't be meeting with you wants to meet with you, they tend to suggest an off-site location: a restaurant downtown, or a nearby coffee shop. Peet's Coffee doesn't keep a list of everyone who walks in or out.
We do not, however, generally treat all federal employees as having a massive ethical cloud over their heads just because they could probably use this workaround to break the law. There is zero reason to apply heightened scrutiny to Clinton just because she also could break the law.

Besides which, when you are secretary of state there is a much simpler and easier way to mask your correspondence: classification.

Here, for example, is an email Sullivan sent to Clinton on June 4, 2011, that was duly handed over to the State Department and made available by the FOIA office:

 
IÃÂm not saying the contents of that message donÃÂt deserve to be redacted for security purposes. The fact is that I have no idea. But the reality is the American national security state is really, really good at using official channels to avoid disclosure of information. Nobody needs a private email server to pull that off.

Indeed, the allegation that the server setup was an elaborate con to evade transparency law is doubly ridiculous. On the one hand, a private server would not be necessary to carry it out. (All you need is to have a private email address on the side, which everyone does.) While on the other hand, the exclusive use of a personal email account means that ClintonÃÂs personal account has come under an exceptional level of security.

The classification thing is a red herring
ItÃÂs precisely because nothing about the basic setup of the email account was in any way wrong that the investigation ended up focusing on the question of mishandling classified information.

The key point here is that using a State.gov email account would not have changed anything. When US government officials have conversations about classified matters, they are not supposed to use email. They are supposed to use special secure channels.

Nonetheless, mistakes happen in part because classification standards are vague and ever-changing. Technically speaking, forwarding a Washington Post article detailing things revealed by Edward Snowden could constitute an improper discussion of classified matters.

As FBI Director James Comey concluded, ÃÂno reasonable prosecutorÃÂ would bring a case against Clinton over this matter. Almost all of the relevant statutes require an intent to mishandle classified information in order to bring a prosecution, a standard that ClintonÃÂs conduct clearly does not meet. Critics have thus chosen to focus on 18 USC ÃÂ§ 793, a statute that sets a lower ÃÂgross negligenceÃÂ standard.

However, as Jack Goldsmith, one of the top lawyers in George W. BushÃÂs administration explains, such a prosecution ÃÂwould be entirely novel, and would turn in part on very tricky questions about how email exchanges fit into language written with physical removal of classified information in mind.ÃÂ

Ben Wittes, a veteran legal journalist and Brookings fellow who has spent the past several years specializing in national security law, wrote that ComeyÃÂs characterization was clearly correct:

For the last several months, people have been asking me what I thought the chances of an indictment were. I have said each time that there is no chance without evidence of bad faith action of some kind. People simply don't get indicted for accidental, non-malicious mishandling of classified material. I have followed leak cases for a very long time, both at the Washington Post and since starting Lawfare. I have never seen a criminal matter proceed without even an allegation of something more than mere mishandling of sensitive information. Hillary Clinton is not above the law, but to indict her on these facts, she'd have to be significantly below the law.
ItÃÂs true that to a layman the Espionage ActÃÂs reference to ÃÂgross negligenceÃÂ sounds similar to ComeyÃÂs characterization of ClintonÃÂs actions as ÃÂextremely careless.ÃÂ But as Philip Zelikow, a counselor to Condoleezza Rice during the Bush administration and currently the Director of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia explains, they only sound alike ÃÂunless you do a tiny bit of homeworkÃÂ on the history and caselaw of the Statute.

Did Hillary Clinton do something criminal with her emails? Philip Zelikow walks you through. #election2016 @AnnCompton @pastpunditry pic.twitter.com/kS8Z4dq9Qf

ÃÂ Miller Center (@Miller_Center) November 3, 2016
As the Cato InstituteÃÂs Julian Sanchez writes, attempting a prosecution for non-malicious mishandling would likely result in the statute being held unconstitutional: ÃÂthe Supreme CourtÃÂs opinion in Gorin v. United States (1941), which suggests that the Espionage ActÃÂs intent requirements are an important feature that save it from unconstitutional vagueness.ÃÂ

This legal analysis is important because it makes it clear that even if the Weiner laptop emails arenÃÂt simply client-side copies of the exact emails the FBI already has, there is essentially no chance it will change the ultimate verdict. The reason Clinton isnÃÂt getting locked up is that there was no malign intent. Finding another email with classified information on it wonÃÂt change that conclusion.

A bullshit scandal amidst a serious election
Network newscasts have, remarkably, dedicated more airtime to coverage of ClintonÃÂs emails than to all policy issues combined.

Cable news has been, if anything, worse, and many prestige outlets have joined the pileup. One malign result of obsessive email coverage is that the public is left totally unaware of the policy stakes in the election. Another is that the constant vague recitations of the phrase ÃÂÃÂClinton email scandalÃÂÃÂ have firmly implanted the notion that there is something scandalous about anything involving Hillary Clinton and email, including her campaign manager getting hacked or the revelation that one of her aides sometimes checked mail on her husbandÃÂs computer.

But none of this is true. Clinton broke no laws according to the FBI itself. Her setup gave her no power to evade federal transparency laws beyond what anyone who has a personal email account of any kind has. Her stated explanation for her conduct is entirely believable, fits the facts perfectly, and is entirely plausible to anyone who doesn't simply start with the assumption that she's guilty of something.

Given PowellÃÂs conduct, Clinton wasn't even breaking with an informal precedent. The very worst you can say is that, faced with an annoying government IT policy, she used her stature to find a personal workaround rather than a systemic fix that would work for everyone. To spend so much time on such a trivial matter would be absurd in a city council race, much less a presidential election. To do so in circumstances when it advances the electoral prospects of a rival who has shattered all precedents in terms of lacking transparency or basic honesty is infinitely more scandalous than anything related to the server itself."	0
256	"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂIn an Oval Office meeting that White House aides described as ÃÂfriendly but strained,ÃÂ President Obama politely asked President-elect Donald Trump to wait until he is officially sworn in to begin destroying the world.

According to the aides, Obama said that, while he understood that Trump was eager to create potentially cataclysmic diplomatic crises around the world, tradition dictated that he wait until he is actually President to do so.

Obama cited the example of George W. Bush, who waited until he took the oath of office before wreaking destruction on a massive scale.

ÃÂThereÃÂll be loads of time for you to do stuff like that,ÃÂ Obama reportedly said.

During the meeting, which lasted nearly an hour, Obama repeatedly asked Trump ÃÂif he understood what was being said to him,ÃÂ the aides reported.

After the meeting, Trump spoke briefly with reporters but cut the session short to ÃÂjump on a phone call with Kim Jong-un.ÃÂ

ÃÂHeÃÂs a terrific guy, heÃÂs doing just a terrific job over there,ÃÂ Trump said, of the North Korean leader.

Obama did not take questions from reporters but was later seen sitting at his desk, holding his head in his hands."	0

White House cleaning manager, Maria Hernandez has revealed that most of her staff will be so relieved they are going, ÃÂit was really hard on myself and my team. Mr President used to leave rubbish everywhere ÃÂ old newspapers, M&M wrappers, you name itÃÂ.

ItÃÂs understood that shortly after the Trump election victory, a number of White House cleaning staff took the following afternoon off for a celebratory drink at local cocktail bar ÃÂoff the recordÃÂ. It was here that they finally realized 8 years of extremely hard cleaning would subside.

ÃÂIt was terribleÃÂ said Antonia Juan-Fernando, ÃÂMr Obama used to love cookies and the crumbs he would leave, aye yai yaiÃÂ. An optimistic Juan-Fernando believes that not only will Trump, ÃÂMake America Great AgainÃÂ, but that he will also know how to do some basic cleaning.

258	"AMES, IOWA (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂPresidential candidate Donald Trump revealed a little-known episode of personal heroism from his youth on Saturday, telling an Iowa audience that he narrowly avoided capture in Vietnam by remaining in the United States for the duration of the war.

ÃÂThe Cong were after me,ÃÂ Trump said, visibly stirred by the memory. ÃÂAnd then, just in the nick of time, I got my deferment.ÃÂ

The former reality-show star said he had never shared his record as a war hero before because ÃÂI donÃÂt like to boast.ÃÂ

He said that he only disclosed the episode now because ÃÂthe way this nation treats our deferment veterans is a disgrace.ÃÂ

Trump complained that he received no official commendation or medal for his heroism, calling the lack of recognition ÃÂshameful.ÃÂ

ÃÂThose brave Americans who, like me, avoided being captured by not serving at allÃÂwe are the true heroes,ÃÂ he said.

259	"Manhattan ÃÂ Earlier this morning, Trump University issued degrees to 4,500 students online, and drew the attention of national media when the university announced several high-profile recipients of honorary degrees, sources say.

ÃÂWe doctors are the shakers and the movers, the pokers and jokers, the wheelinÃÂ and the stealinÃÂ, ObamaÃÂs been to that mountaintop, that I can tell youÃÂÃÂ Palin told a crowd of the stupidest humans alive Saturday morning.

Palin has been in the headlines this week after questioning whether or not Bill Nye, ÃÂThe Science GuyÃÂ was in fact an actual scientist.

260	"Today, a young woman working for an anti-child trafficking organization was laid to rest.  Her name was Monica Petersen, and she turned up dead in Haiti on Sunday after posting ÃÂI Found A Smoking GunÃÂ on social media.  Her friends and family are calling foul as her family cannot get believable information from Haitian authorities, and Ms. Petersen just happened to publicly post some reports that implicate the ClintonsÃÂ involvement in alleged human trafficking via a mine run by Hillary ClintonÃÂs brother Tony Rodham.

A compilation of the various threads from reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Imgur and more can be found on the Reddit The Donald page here.


Go figure.  Just like any number of people either close to the Clintons or investigating them who could possibly end up a material witness during a trial, Ms. Petersen ends up dead.  This, for those following the ÃÂfake newsÃÂ propaganda coming out of globalists, leftists, and the disgraced legacy media, is why there is a ÃÂClinton Body Count.ÃÂ  Monica PetersenÃÂs name may well be added to it.


According to several reports, Haiti has been a nexus for child trafficking for a number of years.  In fact, found in the thousands of emails released by WikiLeaks from John PodestaÃÂs email account, information surfaced that Hillary Clinton assisted a Haitian woman, Laura Silsby, known to be involved in child trafficking in 2010 when she was caught trying to take 33 children ÃÂ not orphans ÃÂ out of Haiti.  The two womenÃÂs history is known to reach back at least fifteen years.  Also in the Podesta emails are several archaic conversations about pizza that have taken on the aura of internet lore (what some call conspiracy theories) known as #pizzagate, and reportedly is the tip of the iceberg in an international child trafficking ring.

The rabbit hole gets very deep when one considers how many times Bill Clinton is known to have traveled Jeffrey EpsteinÃÂs private child molestation island.

Did Monica Petersen get too close? A tenacious young woman investigating one of the most egregious crimes any human can commit, if she got too close to the criminal element and was known to them, it is a definite possibility.  A good friend of hers named Bella claims she found out what happened and is refusing to elaborate on public next-pagemessaging boards.  Whatever the case is, the people around the Clintons and those investigating them sure do tend to end up dead."	1
261	"WASHINGTON ÃÂ The very first President's Intelligence Checklist ÃÂ the predecessor to what's now known as the President's Daily Briefing ÃÂ was delivered to President John F. Kennedy on a June Saturday in 1961. Typewritten on eight pages of 8.5-by-8-inch paper and stamped ""For the President Only ÃÂ Top Secret,"" it contained 14 two-sentence briefs culled from diplomatic, military, intelligence and press sources, six shorter notes, and maps of Laos and the Congo.

Today, President Obama receives the document on an iPad. The articles are somewhat longer and sometimes have dissenting opinions. The maps can be interactive, and the briefings can include video.

The differences aren't just technological. After serving 10 presidents ÃÂ and now preparing to brief the 11th, President-elect Donald Trump ÃÂ the President's Daily Briefing has had to adjust to the reading habits and decision-making styles of each commander in chief.

And the ways in which it's produced, read and discussed provide a rare insight into how presidents approach national security issues.

""ItÃÂs the only standing meeting he has every day. Even if we donÃÂt have the meeting, he gets the document,"" said Obama's deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes. ""Everyday there's the possibility that he'll see something that will cause him to move the entire U.S. government in a new direction. There's nothing else like that.""

For Obama, the PDB process paints a portrait of a methodical president who's often disdainful of raw, unfiltered intelligence in favor of more analytical perspective. He encourages dissenting opinions. He's interested in ""open source"" intelligence ÃÂ including press accounts and, increasingly, social media ÃÂ in addition to old-fashioned spycraft and intercepted communications.

President-elect Trump has yet to make a formal mark on intelligence. He's still getting a daily intelligence briefing designed for, and catered to, Obama. He's reading it largely as a courtesy by the incumbent president, part of a bipartisan tradition dating back to President Harry Truman.

But Trump has already suggested a different style of receiving intelligence. For the first month, he received in-person intelligence briefings only once a week, although his transition team now says it's three times a week.

But Trump himself has suggested a more ad hoc system of being updated only when major developments warrant.

""I get it when I need it,"" Trump told Fox News Sunday.

""I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,"" he said. ""I don't need that. But I do say, 'If something should change, let us know.' ""

In skipping daily briefings, Trump shows ambivalence toward intel agencies
Aides: Trump gets frequent classified briefings
Obama has said much the same about his daily briefing ÃÂ albeit much later in his presidency.

""Over the years, you accumulate knowledge,"" Obama said in a YouTube interview earlier this year. ""Now, I've got enough of a baseline of knowledge. I've seen problems come up before, I've seen patterns that have emerged. I might not have to go into the briefing book as deeply as I did. ... I'm skimming. I'm looking at, are there significant differences?""

The frequency, the duration, the format, the depth, the subject matter ÃÂ even the distribution list ÃÂ are all up to the president.

In a book published earlier this year, former CIA officer David Priess argued that the PDB has had to adapt to each president who has receives it ÃÂ and will continue to evolve to meet the president's personality, learning style and priorities.

""If a new president comes in and he wants the PDB presented through interpretive dance, he or she will get that,"" said Priess, author of The President's Book of Secrets: The Untold Story of Intelligence Briefings. ""There will be a whole lot of intelligence officers taking dancing lessons.""

The President's Daily Briefing is what its name implies, Priess said.

""It is brief. Everything is not going to make it in. ItÃÂs daily. If itÃÂs not breaking, or not current, it doesnÃÂt get in,"" he said. ""But the most important word is 'president.' Is this deserving of his attention?""

That's a question that the intelligence community is constantly trying to reassess. And the transition period is a critical time for the incoming president to get up to speed on intelligence issues ÃÂ and for the intelligence community to get to know the president-elect.

Current and former national security officials say frequent, in-person briefings with the president ÃÂ and the president-elect ÃÂ are an essential part of making sure the commander in chief is well-informed.

""There is a certain amount of trial and error to really settle in to what the new team wants,"" former CIA director Michael Hayden said. In his book, Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the Age of Terror, he describes what the intelligence community crudely refers to as the ""aw, s---"" moment.

Michael Hayden is a retired Air Force four-star general,

It's attempt by intelligence officials to challenge the worldview of the president-elect's political advisers with a dose of reality. Hayden calls it ""phenomenon of the unpleasant fact.""

""That's when the intelligence guys give the president information and analysis that cuts across the policy or politics grain of the administration. You're telling them something they donÃÂt want to hear and donÃÂt want to believe,"" he said.

And it's important to do that in an in-person briefing, as opposed to the written product. ""You have to shake the preferred narrative of the policymaker,"" Hayden said. ""And you need the ability to do that face to face, and to do it with your tone, and your words and your body language to communicate, as opposed to just throwing it over the transom.""

When Obama first took office, the intelligence community grumbled that Obama ÃÂ or at least his national security staff ÃÂ wanted the reports so brief that they called them ""PDB haiku.""

Hayden's early briefings of Obama (he was replaced three weeks into Obama's presidency) were ""far less tactical"" than the briefings President George W. Bush was receiving.

But Michael Leiter, who directed the National Counterterrorism Center under both Bush and Obama, said he saw Obama grow in his use of intelligence from those early months.

""His inclination from the start was less about the tactics and more about the strategy, and more about how the U.S. was perceived in the world and interacted in the world,"" he said.

""But there certainly was an evolution. To me, that was most crystallized, around the time of underwear bomber,"" he said, referring to the Christmas Day 2009 plot to bring down a Detroit-bound airliner. ""That so changed the president's perception of how detail oriented he had to be on these things.""

From then on, he said, any terrorism threat the president was briefed about also had to include an operational briefing about what was being done to address it.

Still, it's a difficult balancing act for the president and his briefing team. Rhodes said the president needs to be disciplined enough not to be distracted by the uncorroborated bits of information ÃÂ or to attribute more credibility to information only because it's classified. ""Sometimes you are so focused on what is secret that you're not looking at what's right in front of your eyes,"" Rhodes said in an interview with USA TODAY before the election.

""ItÃÂs worrisome to get into raw intelligence,"" he said. ""Because you may have some intercept that you think is great, but it could be some official in some country, it could be just their view, or what they hope happens. Or, sometimes they know that the (National Security Agency) is listening, and they want us to intercept that raw intelligence. That's where the job of ODNI is very hard.""

While the briefing is assembled by ODNI with input from the entire intelligence community, the CIA ÃÂ by virtue of its historic role and experience in analysis ÃÂ still has an outsized role in the process.

Obama has said he's conscientious about hearing from a broad array of experts. ""I've learned to be pretty good at listening carefully to people who know a lot more than I do about a topic,"" Obama said in the YouTube interview. ""And taking sure that any dissenting voices are in the same room at the same time.""

But while Obama says he listens to all voices, not all of those voices feel that they're being heard.

A 2014 report from the Intelligence Community Inspector General interviewed intelligence analysts across the government and found that ""broader community participation in the President's Daily Brief (PDB) remains a challenge.""

Rhodes said the president has increasingly asked for lower-level analysts who are experts in a political topic to brief him personally ÃÂ a practice that has been going on at least since Jimmy Carter's presidency. ""Let's get the analysts who are living through these issues every day,"" Rhodes said. ""He likes that, so he's tried to do that more.""

The daily book often contains dissenting views, which Leiter said were ""often the most illuminating thing in a PDB article.""

And under Obama, non-urgent raw intelligence often gets shopped around the intelligence community for corroboration and analysis before making it to the president. And highly sensitive information gleaned from top-secret sources and methods is balanced with open-source intelligence ÃÂ the kind of information that's available to anyone reading a newspaper.

'Rebalancing' the PDB

Presidents, of course, also send signals back to the intelligence community about their policy priorities ÃÂ and that gets reflected in their briefings.

Richard Nixon's had a heavy emphasis on Vietnam and China. Ronald Reagan's was almost singularly obsessed with the Soviet Union. And for the last two presidents, the Middle East has dominated the PDB ÃÂ to the extent that the White House has occasionally had to remind intelligence agencies that Obama wants a wider aperture.

""You could write the PDB every day and never talk about anything except the Middle East and Russia,"" Rhodes said. ""To the point where weÃÂve had to say, 'Hey, guys, we're rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific. Make sure that's represented in the PDB.' You almost have to reach out for that stuff, because it doesn't always naturally come up.""

Obama's PDB also increasingly includes information on economic, environmental and public health crises that could have an impact on national security. And they're not necessarily confined to foreign affairs. Last summer, deputy press secretary Eric Schultz confirmed that Obama had been briefed on the spread of the Zika virus in Florida as part of his daily intelligence briefing.

World's most exclusive newspaper

The President's Daily Briefing, also known as ""the book,"" is among the most secret documents the government keeps. For a time, even its very existence was thought to be classified.

It's just one of dozens of products regularly produced by the intelligence community. But because it gets the attention of the commander in chief, it has a sense of urgency and importance ÃÂ and even mystique ÃÂ that other top secret documents don't have.

""Today it is such a vital part of how the White House operates that one can hardly imagine the modern presidency without it,"" said CIA Director John Brennan as the agency declassified 2,500 briefings to Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson last year. ""The PDB is the most abundantly staffed, most deeply sourced daily information service in the world.""

It's been referred to as the world's most exclusive daily newspaper, written exclusively for the president of the United States.

But presidents can and do share the PDB with a small circle of advisers.

Kennedy never shared his with his vice president. Nixon deeply distrusted the CIA and often ignored the briefing, instead delegating it to national security adviser Henry Kissinger.

The younger Bush restricted the distribution to just six or seven people. In the Obama administration, the distribution list is thought to be as many as two dozen, including the secretary of State. In her book Hard Choices, Clinton called the hand-delivered report the ""first order of business"" after getting to the office each morning. Her schedules, released under the Freedom of Information Act, often allotted the first five minutes of every morning to reading the PDB.

The president could even share the briefing with members of his family. Trump and his family have denied reports that he's sought security clearances for his children and for son-in-law Jared Kushner, but the president is the ultimate authority on how classified information can be shared and with whom.

Trump has also raised eyebrows by appearing to question the CIA's integrity in the wake of reports that the spy agency had concluded that Russia deliberately interfered in the election to get Trump elected. ""These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,"" the Trump transition said in a statement to reporters last week.

That prompted the White House to defend the intelligence officers ÃÂ and suggest that Trump would do well to listen to them.

""President ObamaÃÂs experience over the last eight years has been that the men and women of the intelligence community in the United States are patriots,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday. ""President Obama is certainly not the first president to have enjoyed the benefits of the experts in our intelligence community, and I'm confident the president-elect would benefit from that advice if he remains open to it.""

262	"President-elect Donald Trump's dismissal of U.S. intelligence findings that Russia tried to sway the presidential election is a distressing slap in the face to the intelligence community, current and former U.S. intelligence officials said Sunday.

Trump on Sunday repeated his rejection of the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia actively worked to help him win the election, calling the idea ""ridiculous"" in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday.""

The comment, like others that Trump made during the campaign, ""is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country,"" a U.S. intelligence official told NBC News.

The official called it ""concerning"" that the president-elect has chosen to ""impugn the integrity of U.S. intelligence officials"" by disputing professional intelligence judgments as false or politically partisan.

A congressional official with knowledge of the issue told NBC News on Saturday that the CIA has concluded that Russia mounted a covert intelligence operation to help Trump win the election.

Another source briefed on the intelligence told NBC News that the U.S. government has identified specific Russian actors it believes were involved in computer systems hacks ÃÂ based on intercepted communications, human tips and computer forensics.

A former senior intelligence official also noted Trump's assertion Sunday on Fox News that he doesn't always take the Presidential Daily Briefing ÃÂ the top-secret briefing on national security developments ÃÂ because ""I'm, like, a smart person.""

""It is curious that someone who refuses to take intelligence briefings has decided that he doesn't agree with the analysis contained in them,"" the former official said.

Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat the House Intelligence Committee, also blasted Trump, saying the integrity of the electoral process is called into question ""when President-elect Trump and his transition team minimize or dismiss the intelligence assessments themselves.""

""Even more damaging are comments that impugn the tens of thousands of Americans who are at work every day of the year, many in great physical danger, to protect us and to provide our national leadership ÃÂ regardless of political party ÃÂ with the best information possible,"" Schiff said Saturday.

""Perhaps, once he has taken office, Mr. Trump will go to the CIA and look at the rows of memorial stars in the lobby ÃÂ each representing a fallen officer ÃÂ and reflect on his disparagement of the intelligence community's work,"" he said."	0
263	"Los Angeles | Yoko Ono shocked reporters yesterday when she responded to a question concerning the presidential run of Hillary Clinton and the possibility that she could become the first woman President of the United States in American history.

The artist and widow of John Lennon, who is in Los Angeles to present a collection of cups and saucers she is exhibiting at the Museum of Modern Art, totally took reporters by surprise by admitting she had not only met the former First Lady at various times during a series of protests against the Vietnam War in New York in the 1970s but also knew her ÃÂintimatelyÃÂ.

The celebrity admitted laughingly to having ÃÂa flingÃÂ with her at the time and acknowledged her election ÃÂwould be a great advancement for LGBT and Women rights in AmericaÃÂ she added.

Yoko Ono shocked reporters when she admitted to ""having a fling"" with the former Secretary of State after they met during a protest against the Vietnam War in New York in the early 1970s
Hillary Clinton has been hit by a series of allegations of being a lesbian in her career which could ruin her bid for the presidency, believe some experts
Yoko Ono when asked about her thoughts about HillaryÃÂs run for the presidency completely took reporters by surprise.

ÃÂWe met many times during the New York Vietnam War protests in the 1970s, and became very intimate. We shared many of the same values about sexual equality, fighting against the authoritarian, patriarchal, male-dominated society we were raised inÃÂ she explained.

ÃÂWe had a brief romantic fling when I lived with John in Manhattan and Hillary was studying at Yale, but eventually we lost touch. I am amazed how things are going well for her and wish her the best for her campaignÃÂ she told reporters during the press conference.

Experts believe the statement could affect the presidential candidates bid for the presidency but previous allegations of Hillary ClintonÃÂs lesbian past have not seemed to play against the front runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential race yet."	1
264	"President Barack ObamaÃÂs legacy might soon be tarnished beyond repair. The long-awaited results from an in-depth investigation into ObamaÃÂs past have just been revealed.

Barack ObamaÃÂs birth certificate is a fakeÃÂ a complete forgery, and now evidence to prove it is headed to Congress. Arizona Sheriff Joe ApraioÃÂs investigation into ObamaÃÂs birth certificate found multiple ÃÂinconsistencies,ÃÂ which could allow Congress to impeach the 44th president of the United States even after he leaves office, WND reports.

The forensic investigation into ObamaÃÂs birth certificate reportedly proves the ÃÂbirthersÃÂ were right all along! Jerome Corsi, Ph.D., a WND senior staff writer, is credited with forcing the Obama administration to release the document in the first place.

CorsiÃÂs book, WhereÃÂs The Birth Certificate?, first brought the Obama birth certificate issue to the publicÃÂs attention. The Constitution requires a presidential candidate to be a ÃÂnatural-born citizenÃÂ but does not really define exactly what the entails ÃÂ meaning even though Obama was born to an American woman, he still might not have qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

ÃÂI was raised as an Indonesian child and a Hawaiian child and as a black child and as a white child,ÃÂ Obama once said, according to a report by the Miller Center. Obama spent four years of his childhood living in Indonesia with his mother and stepfather.

Sheriff Joe ApraioÃÂs forensic investigation into ObamaÃÂs birth certificate revealed the document presented to the public appears to be identical to and copied from another birth certificate issued in Hawaii just several days after he was born. The exceedingly similar birth certificate reportedly belongs to Johanna AhÃÂnee.

The items on the supposed Obama birth certificate, which appear to have been copied from the Johanna AhÃÂnee birth certificate, include the word ÃÂHonolulu,ÃÂ the word ÃÂOahuÃÂ twice, two time stamps, and three different Xs. The identical appearance of the Xs was reportedly of particular interest to forensic investigators.

The Xs would have been placed on the original birth certificate documents by moving a typewriter carriage and rolling over the certificate at the same time. Investigators reportedly found it interesting that the stamp made by Alvin Onaka and the April 25th stamp might have been lifted from another document.

One of the expert forensic investigators who participated in the review of the Obama birth certificate was Reed Hayes. He is a court-qualified document examiner and handwriting examiner.

Reed Hayes also operates a business in Hawaii. He has been on the board of Scientific Association of Forensic Examiners for almost four decades. Forlabs, an Italian company which specializes in extracting details and information from multimedia files, produced the results of the Obama birth certificate forensic investigation.

ÃÂWe had two experts from two countries in separate disciplines of forensics that came to one conclusion: Barack ObamaÃÂs long form birth certificate it not authentic,ÃÂ the report said.

Mike Zullo, the lead forensic investigator involved with the report, quoted details from the investigation by Hayes: ÃÂThe (nail in the coffin) that proves that Certificate of Live Birth is inauthentic is the exact lineup of numerous entries on both [certificates].ÃÂ Zullo added the experts likened the evidence they found to prove the Obama birth certificate is a forgery to being as reliable as a fingerprint."	1
265	"WOW..

Donald Trump has sent the Internet into a frenzy again today by adding a new stipulation for people that come to see him speak at his campaign rallyÃÂs and itÃÂs called the ÃÂBrown Paper Bag TestÃÂ

For those unfamiliar with the brown paper test, itÃÂs where the skin tone of African-Americans were visually measured against an actual brown paper bag; individuals lighter than the bag were labeled with more positive attributes compared to dark skin males and females.

""The Brown Paper Bag Test""
ÃÂThe Brown Paper Bag TestÃÂ
It gained popularity after the abolishment of slavery in 1865 and unconsciously, this test still seems to exists within the black community, especially when it comes to dating. Preference is natural in any aspect of life but within the black community bias stereotypes can fog decisions and lead to unhealthy relationships.

Now Donald Trump has decided to use this test at all future campaign rallyÃÂs and if you are not lighter than the brown paper bag you will not gain entry into any of his Pep RallyÃÂs.

Trump released a statement saying:

ÃÂITÃÂS NOT ABOUT BLACK OR WHITE, ITÃÂS ABOUT RICH AND POOR, CLASS AND NO CLASS, WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON? IÃÂM ON AMERICAÃÂS SIDE AND I WILL MAKE HER GREAT AGAINÃÂ"	1
266	"DONALD J. TRUMP, until now a Republican problem, this week became a challenge the nation must confront and overcome. The real estate tycoon is uniquely unqualified to serve as president, in experience and temperament. He is mounting a campaign of snarl and sneer, not substance. To the extent he has views, they are wrong in their diagnosis of AmericaÃÂs problems and dangerous in their proposed solutions. Mr. TrumpÃÂs politics of denigration and division could strain the bonds that have held a diverse nation together. His contempt for constitutional norms might reveal the nationÃÂs two-century-old experiment in checks and balances to be more fragile than we knew.

Any one of these characteristics would be disqualifying; together, they make Mr. Trump a peril. We recognize that this is not the usual moment to make such a statement. In an ordinary election year, we would acknowledge the Republican nominee, move on to the Democratic convention and spend the following months, like other voters, evaluating the candidatesÃÂ performance in debates, on the stump and in position papers. This year we will follow the campaign as always, offering honest views on all the candidates. But we cannot salute the Republican nominee or pretend that we might endorse him this fall. A Trump presidency would be dangerous for the nation and the world.

Why are we so sure? Start with experience. It has been 64 years since a major party nominated anyone for president who did not have electoral experience. That experiment turned out pretty well ÃÂ but Mr. Trump, to put it mildly, is no Dwight David Eisenhower. Leading the Allied campaign to liberate Europe from the Nazis required strategic and political skills of the first order, and Eisenhower ÃÂ though he liked to emphasize his common touch as he faced the intellectual Democrat Adlai Stevenson ÃÂ was shrewd, diligent, humble and thoughtful.

In contrast, there is nothing on Mr. TrumpÃÂs rÃÂ©sumÃÂ© to suggest he could function successfully in Washington. He was staked in the family business by a well-to-do father and has pursued a career marked by some real estate successes, some failures and repeated episodes of saving his own hide while harming people who trusted him. Given his continuing refusal to release his tax returns, breaking with a long bipartisan tradition, it is only reasonable to assume there are aspects of his record even more discreditable than what we know.

The lack of experience might be overcome if Mr. Trump saw it as a handicap worth overcoming. But he displays no curiosity, reads no books and appears to believe he needs no advice. In fact, what makes Mr. Trump so unusual is his combination of extreme neediness and unbridled arrogance. He is desperate for affirmation but contemptuous of other views. He also is contemptuous of fact. Throughout the campaign, he has unspooled one lie after another ÃÂ that Muslims in New Jersey celebrated after 9/11, that his tax-cut plan would not worsen the deficit, that he opposed the Iraq War before it started ÃÂ and when confronted with contrary evidence, he simply repeats the lie. It is impossible to know whether he convinces himself of his own untruths or knows that he is wrong and does not care. It is also difficult to know which trait would be more frightening in a commander in chief.

Given his ignorance, it is perhaps not surprising that Mr. Trump offers no coherence when it comes to policy. In years past, he supported immigration reform, gun control and legal abortion; as candidate, he became a hard-line opponent of all three. Even in the course of the campaign, he has flip-flopped on issues such as whether Muslims should be banned from entering the United States and whether women who have abortions should be punished . Worse than the flip-flops is the absence of any substance in his agenda. Existing trade deals are ÃÂstupid,ÃÂ but Mr. Trump does not say how they could be improved. The Islamic State must be destroyed, but the candidate offers no strategy for doing so. Eleven million undocumented immigrants must be deported, but Mr. Trump does not tell us how he would accomplish this legally or practically.

What the candidate does offer is a series of prejudices and gut feelings, most of them erroneous. Allies are taking advantage of the United States. Immigrants are committing crimes and stealing jobs. Muslims hate America. In fact, Japan and South Korea are major contributors to an alliance that has preserved a peace of enormous benefit to Americans. Immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans and take jobs that no one else will. Muslims are the primary victims of Islamist terrorism, and Muslim Americans, including thousands who have served in the military, are as patriotic as anyone else.

[Fareed Zakaria: America would be TrumpÃÂs banana republic]

The Trump litany of victimization has resonated with many Americans whose economic prospects have stagnated. They deserve a serious champion, and the challenges of inequality and slow wage growth deserve a serious response. But Mr. Trump has nothing positive to offer, only scapegoats and dark conspiracy theories. He launched his campaign by accusing Mexico of sending rapists across the border, and similar hatefulness has surfaced numerous times in the year since.

In a dangerous world, Mr. Trump speaks blithely of abandoning NATO, encouraging more nations to obtain nuclear weapons and cozying up to dictators who in fact wish the United States nothing but harm. For eight years, Republicans have criticized President Obama for ÃÂapologizingÃÂ for America and for weakening alliances. Now they put forward a candidate who mimics the vilest propaganda of authoritarian adversaries about how terrible the United States is and how unfit it is to lecture others. He has made clear that he would drop allies without a second thought. The consequences to global security could be disastrous.

Most alarming is Mr. TrumpÃÂs contempt for the Constitution and the unwritten democratic norms upon which our system depends. He doesnÃÂt know what is in the nationÃÂs founding document. When asked by a member of Congress about Article I, which enumerates congressional powers, the candidate responded, ÃÂI am going to abide by the Constitution whether itÃÂs number 1, number 2, number 12, number 9.ÃÂ The charter has seven articles.

Worse, he doesnÃÂt seem to care about its limitations on executive power. He has threatened that those who criticize him will suffer when he is president. He has vowed to torture suspected terrorists and bomb their innocent relatives, no matter the illegality of either act. He has vowed to constrict the independent press. He went after a judge whose rulings angered him, exacerbating his contempt for the independence of the judiciary by insisting that the judge should be disqualified because of his Mexican heritage. Mr. Trump has encouraged and celebrated violence at his rallies. The U.S. democratic system is strong and has proved resilient when it has been tested before. We have faith in it. But to elect Mr. Trump would be to knowingly subject it to threat.

Mr. Trump campaigns by insult and denigration, insinuation and wild accusation: Ted CruzÃÂs father was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy; Hillary Clinton may be guilty of murder; Mr. Obama is a traitor who wants Muslims to attack. The Republican Party has moved the lunatic fringe onto center stage, with discourse that renders impossible the kind of substantive debate upon which any civil democracy depends.

Most responsible Republican leaders know all this to be true; that is why Mr. Trump had to rely so heavily on testimonials by relatives and employees during this weekÃÂs Republican convention. With one exception (Bob Dole), the living Republican presidents and presidential nominees of the past three decades all stayed away. But most current officeholders, even those who declared Mr. Trump to be an unthinkable choice only months ago, have lost the courage to speak out.

The partyÃÂs failure of judgment leaves the nationÃÂs future where it belongs, in the hands of voters. Many Americans do not like either candidate this year . We have criticized the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, in the past and will do so again when warranted. But we do not believe that she (or the Libertarian and Green party candidates, for that matter) represents a threat to the Constitution. Mr. Trump is a unique and present danger."	0
267	"Republican Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney has finally seduced uncertain Tea Party members with a romantic evening of candles, wine, and Barry White songs. ÃÂIÃÂve had my doubts about Romney in the past but he has won me over with his vision for unlimited economic growth... and unlimited love,ÃÂ said Tea Party activist Michael Tellurose. ÃÂNow, heÃÂs the first, the last, my everything.ÃÂ

Political insiders report that Romney invited all skeptical Tea Party members into an elegant, dimly-lit Washington, D.C. hotel room, with rose petals scattered across the floor. ÃÂAfter lighting some jasmine vanilla-scented candles, Romney poured glasses of Zinfandel for each person,ÃÂ said writer Otis LeFrane. Then, Romney played ÃÂIÃÂll Do for You Anything You Want Me ToÃÂ from WhiteÃÂs 1975 album Just Another Way to Say I Love You and the rest, as LeFrane noted, was ÃÂecstasy.ÃÂ

As WhiteÃÂs deep baritone filled the room, Tea Party member Shirley Burnstill tried to ask Romney about his Massachusetts health care plan but Romney simply put his right index finger to his lips and said, ÃÂDarling, please donÃÂt make me wait too long.ÃÂ What happened after this is open to speculation, but Burnstill apparently promised to make Romney the ÃÂfruit between her sheets.ÃÂ Burnstill later clarified, noting, ÃÂHeÃÂs qualified to satisfy me/Anyway I want him to.ÃÂ "	0
268	"Like growing numbers of Americans, I am disgusted by what presidential historian Douglas Brinkley has accurately but politely described as the ÃÂhyper-partisanshipÃÂ of todayÃÂs political discourse.

We are a house badly divided. Worse yet, weÃÂre like a family where the family members canÃÂt even have a civil dinner table conversation. Actually, we canÃÂt even keep the lasagna on our plate without flinging a forkful across the table.

The Debt Ceiling Debacle is the latest stop ÃÂ perhaps the end of the line ÃÂ on the train to nowhere that the American political ÃÂconversationÃÂ has become. ItÃÂs like the Democrats and Republicans are drag racing down Constitution Avenue, making obscene gestures at each other, hurtling unbeknownst (or, worse yet, knowingly) towards certain death. Only, oh yeah, weÃÂre in the backseat.

Then there is just the sheer exhaustion of daily exposure to strident, mean-spirited and jabbering politicians who have misplaced their prescriptions for chill pills. I mean, really, a roiling, broiling over-heated non-debate is absolutely the last thing we need in a summer marked with sustained record-breaking temperatures. ItÃÂs saying a lot when, this July, more Americans will succumb to political exhaustion than to heat stroke.

ItÃÂs all so enervating. As Huff Post blogger and Columbia University professor Trey Ellis keenly observed a few days back, ÃÂCubs fans are less depressed than fans of a brighter American future.ÃÂ 

Taxation without Representation ÃÂ or Sanity

The problem with this political shrilly season ÃÂ besides the fact that it is bringing us to the brink of financial ruin ÃÂ is that almost no oneÃÂs point of view is being represented. This is worse than Taxation without Representation; this is Taxation without Sanity.

WhoÃÂs to blame for this sorry and troubling state of affairs? Some point their fingers to the Tea PartyÃÂs cold and calculated hijacking of the Republican agenda. Others blame the Pelosi-Reid Cabal (which, I was surprised recently to learn, is not an indie rock group). All I know is that 200 million or so Americans are left with no voice in whatÃÂs supposed to be a representative system of government.

Well, just like Howard Beale, anchor of the fictional UBS Evening News from Network, who 35 years ago brought the nation together in frustration, I am also opening up my window to the world and shouting, ÃÂIÃÂm mad as hell, and IÃÂm not going to take this anymore!ÃÂ

It is time for America to reestablish and reclaim the middle ground with a third party that we can all get behind. ThatÃÂs why, today, I am announcing the formation of the Arnold Palmer Party (APP). Our singular goal: to refresh the American political discourse.

Get Down with APP

Our party takes its name from the popular summertime refresher ÃÂ the Arnold Palmer ÃÂ a delightful, hard-to-resist combination of iced tea and lemonade named after that famous middle-of-the- fairway golfer (and all-around decent human being), Arnold Palmer.

I mean, really, if iced tea and lemonade ÃÂ once thought an unlikely and unappetizing combination ÃÂ can get along...

And consider this important point: the Arnold Palmer Party is steeped ÃÂ literally and figuratively ÃÂ in tradition. The Tea Party may invoke the famous goings-on in Boston Harbor 238 years ago; hell, we drink from that cup. Further, the Arnold Palmer Party is founded on that fundamental expression of American optimism and resolve: When life gives you lemons, make lemonade (and then mix it in equal parts with some fresh-brewed iced tea).

Look, the Tea Party is not without its redeeming qualities. ItÃÂs hard to argue that we can blithely ignore an ever-expanding Federal government and personal responsibility is almost always a good thing. On the other hand, how much money do really rich people really need and what about the lemonade values of shared responsibility, cooperation, equality and empowerment? Which brings us to the Arnold Palmer Party.

Our party is all about solutions and reinvigoration, about ensuring that the interests of those of us who are not two standard deviations away from the middle remain front and center in the public debate on issues of consequence, and about fostering (indeed, insisting on) a constructive, respectful and unhysterical political conversation. We are founded on these five simple tenets:

ÃÂ	We reward collaboration and compromise, not conflict and conflagration;
ÃÂ	We believe in possibility and creative problem-solving;
ÃÂ	We only support political candidates who are civil, cooperative and well hydrated;
ÃÂ	We sign scorecards, not pledges;
ÃÂ	We believe in fair play.

LetÃÂs reclaim the political conversation. We can do this, America. Like Arnold Palmer (the golfer) once said: ÃÂThe most rewarding things you do in life are often the ones that look like they cannot be done.ÃÂ Like everybody coming together to form an even more perfect Union, maybe?

ItÃÂs time for a new ÃÂArnieÃÂs ArmyÃÂ to assemble and walk the fairways of American political discourse. The Arnold Palmer Party. Join us. Because, after all, whatÃÂs a party without a beverage?"	0
269	"The Clinton Machine is coming to screeching halt as ÃÂ27 email chains containing classified informationÃÂ were found on Anthony WeinerÃÂs laptop.

Expect the Congressional Republicans to grill Hillary Clinton, her aides, and the FBI for more information on the contents of the emails.

Fox News reports:

A federal court on Tuesday released the search warrant documents filed by the FBI to access a laptop used by disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife, Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, revealing new details about why the bureau revisited the email case just days before the presidential election.

The FBIÃÂs investigation found ÃÂ27 email chains containing classified informationÃÂ on a laptop that ÃÂwas never authorized for the storage or transmission of classified or national defense information,ÃÂ according to the application for the warrant, which was partially redacted.

The October re-opening of the Clinton investigation sprung from an unrelated case involving Weiner allegedly sexting with an underage girl. During the course of that inquiry, agents discovered the joint laptop and later found emails addressed to and sent from Clinton.

ItÃÂs the end of the line for the Clinton crime machine."	1

The federal government then unveiled an ambitious 90-point plan, tentatively titled ÃÂSmokescreen 2017ÃÂ, that doesnÃÂt address indigenous issues, healthcare, or student debt, instead focusing on making weed ÃÂlike, super duper legal, you know?ÃÂ

ÃÂI mean this doesnÃÂt really solve my problem with their continued backtracking on electoral reform,ÃÂ said local woman Lindsay Gilligan. ÃÂAnd, honestly, a lot of this new weed legislation is troubling. IÃÂm not sure pot should be mandatory even if the nugs will be 100% dank.ÃÂ

Additionally, TrudeauÃÂs plan proposes that all libraries have a box of free doobies, joints, and blunts, that each homeowner must dedicate one room for hydroponics, and completely resolves the carbon tax debate through investment in ÃÂfuzzy, sticky, green energyÃÂ if you know what I meanÃÂ.

271	"HONOLULU -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday designated the bulk of U.S.-owned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean as indefinitely off limits to future oil and gas leasing. 

The move helps put some finishing touches on Mr. ObamaÃÂs environmental legacy while also testing President-elect Donald TrumpÃÂs promise to unleash the nationÃÂs untapped energy reserves. 

The White House announced the actions in conjunction with the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which also placed a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in its Arctic waters, subject to periodic review.

Mr. Obama is making use of an arcane provision in a 1953 law to ban offshore leases in the waters permanently. The statute says that ÃÂthe president of the United States may, from time to time, withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf.ÃÂ 

Environmental groups hope the ban, despite relying on executive powers, will be difficult for future presidents to reverse. The White House said itÃÂs confident the presidentÃÂs order will withstand legal challenge and said the language of the statute provides no authority for subsequent presidents to undo permanent withdrawals. 

The Atlantic waters placed off limits to new oil and gas leasing are 31 canyons stretching off the coast of New England south to Virginia, though some had hoped for a more extensive ban that would have extended further south. 

Existing leases arenÃÂt affected by the presidentÃÂs executive actions. 

The administration cited environmental concerns in both regions to justify the moratorium. Mr. Obama also cited the importance of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in providing subsistence for native Alaskans and the vulnerability of the ecosystem to an oil spill to justify his directive. 

Mr. Obama also noted the level of fuel production occurring in the Arctic. Mr. Obama said just 0.1 percent of offshore crude production came from the Arctic in 2015, and at current oil prices, significant production would not occur in future decades. 

ÃÂThatÃÂs why looking forward, we must continue to focus on economic empowerment for Arctic communities beyond this one sector,ÃÂ Mr. Obama said. 

Still, industry officials objected to Mr. ObamaÃÂs memorandum, calling it ÃÂlast minute political rhetoric.ÃÂ 

ÃÂInstead of building on our nationÃÂs position as a global energy leader, todayÃÂs unilateral mandate could put America back on a path of energy dependence for decades to come,ÃÂ said Dan Naatz of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. 

And Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, said Mr. ObamaÃÂs move marginalized local voices. He said no one is more invested than Alaskans in making sure Arctic habitats are protected. 

ÃÂTo lock it up against any further exploration or development activity is akin to saying that the voices of activists who live in Lower 48 cities have a greater stake than those to whom the Arctic is our front yard and our back yard,ÃÂ he said in a statement. 

In issuing a permanent ban, Mr. Obama appears to be trying to tie the hands of his successor. Mr. Trump has vowed a domestic energy revolution and is filling his Cabinet with nominees deeply opposed to Mr. ObamaÃÂs environmental and climate change actions. 

Environmental groups were calling for a permanent ban even before the presidential election, but Mr. TrumpÃÂs victory has provided greater urgency for them and for businesses that rely on tourism and fishing. Mr. Trump has said he intends to use all available fuel reserves for energy self-sufficiency - and that itÃÂs time to open up offshore drilling. 

ÃÂThis decision will help protect existing lucrative coastal tourism and fishing businesses from offshore drilling, which promises smaller, short-lived returns and threatens coastal livelihoods,ÃÂ said Jacqueline Savitz, a senior vice president at the advocacy group, Oceana. 

A key question to be answered is how difficult it will be for future presidents to overturn Mr. ObamaÃÂs decision should they seek to do so. 

The American Petroleum Institute pointed to 2008 when President George W. Bush used a simple memorandum to remove previously withdrawn lands and make all Outer Continental Shelf lands available for leasing except marine sanctuaries. 

ÃÂFortunately, there is no such thing as a permanent ban,ÃÂ said the instituteÃÂs Erik Milito. 

But White House officials in a conference call with reporters said previous ÃÂindefinite withdrawalsÃÂ remain in place and voiced confidence that Mr. ObamaÃÂs decision will stand. 

Advocacy groups were already warning that they were prepared to file suit to protect the ban during future administrations. 

ÃÂIf Donald Trump tries to reverse President ObamaÃÂs withdrawals, he will find himself in court,ÃÂ said Marissa Knodel of Friends of the Earth. 

Frank Knapp, president of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce in Columbia, said he was ÃÂextremely disappointedÃÂ in the decision not to extend drilling protections to the entire Atlantic seaboard. 

Knapp and his group were among a number of business groups in the southeast who had advocated for banning new drilling leases off their shores, arguing that the environmental impacts would hurt fishing, tourism and other businesses the region relies upon. HeÃÂd gone to Washington to meet with Obama administration officials, and believed the entire Atlantic was to be protected. 

The decision came as Mr. Obama spends the holidays in Hawaii. Some Democratic lawmakers applauded Obama, while some Republicans were highly critical. 

ÃÂAs President-elect Trump nominates fossil fuel allies to his Cabinet, President Obama has instead put the interests of millions of Americans ahead of those of Big Oil with these permanent protections,ÃÂ said Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. 

ÃÂThe extremes to which this president will go to appease special interests never ceases to amaze,ÃÂ countered Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. ÃÂThis is not a moral calling; itÃÂs an abuse of power.ÃÂ"	0
272	"During a 33-year career at the Central Intelligence Agency, I served presidents of both parties ÃÂ three Republicans and three Democrats. I was at President George W. BushÃÂs side when we were attacked on Sept. 11; as deputy director of the agency, I was with President Obama when we killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.

I am neither a registered Democrat nor a registered Republican. In my 40 years of voting, I have pulled the lever for candidates of both parties. As a government official, I have always been silent about my preference for president.

No longer. On Nov. 8, I will vote for Hillary Clinton. Between now and then, I will do everything I can to ensure that she is elected as our 45th president.

Two strongly held beliefs have brought me to this decision. First, Mrs. Clinton is highly qualified to be commander in chief. I trust she will deliver on the most important duty of a president ÃÂ keeping our nation safe. Second, Donald J. Trump is not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security.

I spent four years working with Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state, most often in the White House Situation Room. In these critically important meetings, I found her to be prepared, detail-oriented, thoughtful, inquisitive and willing to change her mind if presented with a compelling argument.

I also saw the secretaryÃÂs commitment to our nationÃÂs security; her belief that America is an exceptional nation that must lead in the world for the country to remain secure and prosperous; her understanding that diplomacy can be effective only if the country is perceived as willing and able to use force if necessary; and, most important, her capacity to make the most difficult decision of all ÃÂ whether to put young American women and men in harmÃÂs way.

Mrs. Clinton was an early advocate of the raid that brought Bin Laden to justice, in opposition to some of her most important colleagues on the National Security Council. During the early debates about how we should respond to the Syrian civil war, she was a strong proponent of a more aggressive approach, one that might have prevented the Islamic State from gaining a foothold in Syria.

I never saw her bring politics into the Situation Room. In fact, I saw the opposite. When some wanted to delay the Bin Laden raid by one day because the White House Correspondents Dinner might be disrupted, she said, ÃÂScrew the White House Correspondents Dinner.ÃÂ

In sharp contrast to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump has no experience on national security. Even more important, the character traits he has exhibited during the primary season suggest he would be a poor, even dangerous, commander in chief.

These traits include his obvious need for self-aggrandizement, his overreaction to perceived slights, his tendency to make decisions based on intuition, his refusal to change his views based on new information, his routine carelessness with the facts, his unwillingness to listen to others and his lack of respect for the rule of law.

The dangers that flow from Mr. TrumpÃÂs character are not just risks that would emerge if he became president. It is already damaging our national security.

President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was a career intelligence officer, trained to identify vulnerabilities in an individual and to exploit them. That is exactly what he did early in the primaries. Mr. Putin played upon Mr. TrumpÃÂs vulnerabilities by complimenting him. He responded just as Mr. Putin had calculated.

Mr. Putin is a great leader, Mr. Trump says, ignoring that he has killed and jailed journalists and political opponents, has invaded two of his neighbors and is driving his economy to ruin. Mr. Trump has also taken policy positions consistent with Russian, not American, interests ÃÂ endorsing Russian espionage against the United States, supporting RussiaÃÂs annexation of Crimea and giving a green light to a possible Russian invasion of the Baltic States.

In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.

Mr. Trump has also undermined security with his call for barring Muslims from entering the country. This position, which so clearly contradicts the foundational values of our nation, plays into the hands of the jihadist narrative that our fight against terrorism is a war between religions.

In fact, many Muslim Americans play critical roles in protecting our country, including the man, whom I cannot identify, who ran the C.I.A.ÃÂs Counterterrorism Center for nearly a decade and who I believe is most responsible for keeping America safe since the Sept. 11 attacks.

My training as an intelligence officer taught me to call it as I see it. This is what I did for the C.I.A. This is what I am doing now. Our nation will be much safer with Hillary Clinton as president."	0

274	"As the father of three daughters, I reserved the right to interview their dates. Seemed only fair to me. After all, my wife and IÃÂd spent 16 or 17 years feeding them, dressing them, funding braces and driving them to volleyball tournaments and piano recitals. A five-minute face-to-face with the guy was a fair expectation. For the next few hours, she would be affected by his ability to drive a car, avoid the bad crowds and stay sober. I wanted to know if he could do it. I wanted to know if he was decent.

This was my word: ÃÂdecent.ÃÂ Would he treat my daughter with kindness and respect? Could he be trusted to bring her home on time? In his language, actions and decisions, would he be a decent guy?

Decency mattered to me as a dad, and decency matters to Americans. We take note of the person who pays their debts. We appreciate the physician who takes time to listen. When the husband honors his wedding vows, when the teacher makes time for the struggling student, when the employee refuses to gossip about her co-worker, when the losing team congratulates the winning team, we can characterize their behavior as decent.

We appreciate decency. We applaud decency. We teach decency. We seek to develop decency.

So why isnÃÂt decency doing better in the presidential race?

The leading Republican candidate to be the next leader of the free world would not pass my decency interview. IÃÂd send him away. IÃÂd tell my daughter to stay home.

I donÃÂt know Mr. Trump. But IÃÂve been chagrined at his antics. He ridiculed a war hero. He made a mockery of a reporterÃÂs menstrual cycle. He made fun of a disabled reporter. He referred to a former first lady, Barbara Bush, as ÃÂmommyÃÂ and belittled Jeb Bush for bringing her on the campaign trail. He routinely calls people ÃÂstupidÃÂ and ÃÂdummy.ÃÂ One writer catalogued 64 occasions that he called someone ÃÂloser.ÃÂ These were not off-line, backstage, overheard, not-to-be-repeated comments. They were publicly and intentionally tweeted, recorded and presented.

Such insensitivities wouldnÃÂt be acceptable even for a middle school student body election. But for the Oval Office? And to do so while brandishing a Bible and boasting of his Christian faith?

I have no inside track on the intricacies of a presidential campaign. IÃÂm a pastor. I donÃÂt endorse candidates or place bumper stickers on my car. But I am protective of the Christian faith. If a public personality calls on Christ one day and calls someone a ÃÂbimboÃÂ the next, is something not awry? And to do so, not once, but repeatedly, unrepentantly and unapologetically? We stand against bullying in schools. ShouldnÃÂt we do the same in presidential politics?

Could concerns be raised about other Christian candidates? Absolutely. But the concern of this article is not policy but tone and decorum. Prior presidents have exercised a restraint of the tongue. ItÃÂs hard to imagine George H.W. Bush using locker room language to demean an opponent on a debate stage. I didnÃÂt vote for President Obama, but I appreciate the manner in which he has maintained the comportment of the office. At least we donÃÂt wince when he stands to speak.

When it comes to language, Mr. Trump inhabits a league of his own. Some of my friends tell me that his language is a virtue. But I respectfully part company with my Christian colleagues who chalk up his abrasive nature to candor. ÃÂFor out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks,ÃÂ Jesus said. Words are a heart monitor. Christians would do well to summon any Christian leader to a higher heart standard. This includes pastors (especially this one), teachers, coaches and, by all means, presidential candidates.

All of them.

The stock explanation for Mr. TrumpÃÂs success is this: He has tapped into the anger of the American people. As one man said, ÃÂWe are voting with our middle finger.ÃÂ Sounds more like a comment for a gang-fight than a presidential election. Anger-fueled reactions have caused trouble ever since Cain was angry at Abel.

We can only hope, and pray, for a return to verbal decency. Perhaps Mr. Trump will better manage his comments. (Worthy of a prayer, for sure.) Or, perhaps the American public will remember the key role of the president: to be the face of America. When he or she speaks, he or she speaks for us. Whether we agree or disagree with the policies of the president, do we not hope that they speak in a way that is consistent with the status of the office?

As far as I remember, I never turned away one of my daughterÃÂs dates. They werenÃÂt perfect, but they were decent fellows. That was all I could ask.

It seems that we should ask the same of these candidates."	0
275	"NEW YORK, NY (SatireWire.com) ÃÂ In the latest staff shakeup, President-elect Donald Trump today reportedly replaced key members of his transition team with an angry, racist coffee mug.

The mug, which portrays an angry man shouting a racist phrase, immediately drew the ire of Democrats, who said it sends ÃÂexactly the wrong signalÃÂ to a divided nation.

But Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway brushed off the criticism.

ÃÂDemocrats talk about healing our country, and yet this kind of talk does nothing to bring our country together,ÃÂ said Conway. ÃÂPresident-elect Trump is very pleased to have the angry, racist coffee mug join his incredible team to make America great again, and I urge all Americans not to judge the angry, racist coffee mug on its past performance, on what we ÃÂthinkÃÂ its views are, or on any other forms of perceiving it, but instead judge it on what it will do in the unknowable future.ÃÂ

Other Republicans accused Democrats of attempting to undermine the incoming president.

ÃÂThey lost the election and now theyÃÂre pointing fingers trying to make the angry, racist coffee mug into a caricature,ÃÂ said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. ÃÂI havenÃÂt met the angry, racist coffee mug personally, so I canÃÂt say itÃÂs racist or not, but I can say itÃÂs ridiculous to claim that the angry, racist coffee mug is entirely responsible for every single thing thatÃÂs printed on it.ÃÂ

Sources inside Trump Tower said the angry, racist coffee mug has so far fit seamlessly into the transition, and hinted that another staff announcement could come as early as tomorrow, when outgoing advisor Mike Rogers, a Republican moderate, will be replaced by a box of firecrackers."	0
276	"YÃÂall are gonna get a REAL kick outta this one. So remember how the Mainstream Media wouldnÃÂt shut up about Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump in the popular vote by 2.8 Million? Well, that is technically true, but they left out one MAJOR factÃÂ

IF YOU DISCOUNT CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK, DONALD TRUMP BEAT HILLARY CLINTON BY MORE THAN 3 MILLION VOTES IN THE OTHER STATES!!



You see, Hillary Clinton managed to win the classic blue states (both of which have massive sanctuary cities) by 4.2 million in California and 1.8 million in New York.

In fact, by those numbers, it is safe to say that California alone is the ENTIRE reason Clinton won the popular vote and California does NOT speak for the entire country.

This is exactly why the electoral college exists, though. These 2 states do not account for the entire nation. They know NOTHING about the problems in places like Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Florida, all of which voted Trump. (H/T ÃÂ Daily Mail)

ÃÂTHIS IS FOOTBALL SEASON. A TEAM CAN HAVE MORE YARDS AND LOSE THE GAME. WHAT MATTERS IS HOW MANY POINTS YOU PUT ON THE BOARD.ÃÂ

277	"FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the bureau won't change the conclusion it made in July after it examined newly revealed emails related to the Hillary Clinton probe.

""Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,"" Comey wrote in a letter to 16 members of Congress.

The investigative team had ""been working around the clock to process and review"" emails found on former New York congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop ÃÂ using a program that targeted only the emails to and from Clinton's closest aide, Huma Abedin, within the time when Clinton was secretary of state.

In a statement, a Justice Department spokesman said, ""The Department of Justice and the FBI dedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously.""

The news comes after the FBI announced it would review a new batch of emails that appeared to be ""pertinent"" to the investigation that was suspended in July, which had looked into Clinton's use of a private server.

Multiple federal sources told NBC News that the emails were found as a part of an ongoing probe into Weiner's alleged illicit communication with an underage girl.

On the Clinton campaign's plane, spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said she was ""glad to see"" that Comey had affirmed the conclusion reached in July and that the ""matter is resolved.""

The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.

A senior law enforcement official confirmed to NBC News that nearly all of the thousands of newly examined emails on Weiner's laptop were duplicates of emails already seen by the team investigating Clinton's server. Although some emails did forward documents previously identified as containing classified information, the review didn't change the total number of classified documents investigators found on the server.


There were unseen emails, the official said, but they were unrelated to government business.

The new letter indicates that the FBI's review is completed. Neither Comey nor the FBI are expected to release any other statements.

Democrats and Republicans had starkly different reactions, although both sides indicated that, beyond Clinton's vindication, the FBI still had much to resolve.

""In the meantime, however, I welcome this news confirming again that no charges are warranted in this matter.""

Republicans quickly countered.

""Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server ÃÂ including to transmit classified information ÃÂ was extremely careless and a dereliction of duty,"" said Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee.

Set for December 15th in Las Vegas, Nevada, the debate is tentatively focused on foreign policy.

ÃÂThey need a little touch of reality,ÃÂ the president said, receiving a wide applause from the audience. ÃÂThis isnÃÂt an audition for the babysitterÃÂs club, itÃÂs the Oval Office.ÃÂ In the past, President Obama has publicly questioned whether or not the current Republican presidential hopefuls possess the ÃÂintellectual and moral fortitudeÃÂ required to run the country.


ÃÂPresidential debates shouldnÃÂt be centered around catering to the candidatesÃÂ comfort level,ÃÂ said CNN political analyst Melissa Cunningham, referring to the most recent CNBC debate which prompted a failed attempt by the GOP to harness control of future debates. Cunningham continued, ÃÂItÃÂll be interesting to see how they field questions from a seasoned politician, particularly one that knows the ins and outs of the job theyÃÂre vying for.ÃÂ

Meanwhile, former Vice Presidential nominee and reality TV star Sarah Palin railed against the Obama administration for ÃÂonce again trying to sandbag the Republican partyÃÂ and suggested the president might be better suited leading a morning call to prayer.

ÃÂSo, you know, I just ÃÂ I just want the guy to win,ÃÂ she added. ÃÂI want American to win. And I donÃÂt know if I would be the person that would be able to help him win, Jake.ÃÂ

Palin did point out, however, that Palin has already had her background investigated ruthlessly.

ÃÂI think IÃÂm pretty much as vetted as anybody in the country,ÃÂ Palin commented. ÃÂSo, I think there are so many other great people out there in America who can serve in this position. I think if someone wanted to choose me, they already know who I am, what I stand for. They wouldnÃÂt be in for any surprises.ÃÂ

Palin would be a controversial pick, there is no doubt, but Trump could do a lot worse. She served John McCain well in his 2008 campaign for president.

Palin has an energy that could match TrumpÃÂs on the trail, and there is no question that she is a tried and true conservative.

What do you think of Palin? Would she make a good Vice President?"	1

According to Philadelphia Newspaper recently, the Pennsylvania State Police raided Democrat-linked group FieldWorks looking for evidence of voter fraud.

285	"TORONTO ÃÂ The emergence of EQAO test results that show half of grade 6 students failing to meet the provincial math standard has prompted the Ontario government to reveal their plan to raise a generation that cannot make sense of the provinceÃÂs monstrous debt.

ÃÂOn the one hand, yes, these children are under-equipped to handle the basic calculations they may encounter outside of school as well as the more difficult problems theyÃÂll see in higher grades,ÃÂ said Education Minister Mitzie Hunter. ÃÂBut on the other hand, they are more than equipped to not understand what it means for Ontario to owe 300 billion dollars, and thus be the worldÃÂs most indebted sub-sovereign borrower.ÃÂ

ÃÂPlus, there is absolutely no way they could understand how abysmal our deficit spending plan is.ÃÂ

The test, whose math component included questions on volume, fraction arithmetic and the cancelled Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, was designed to measure studentsÃÂ aptitude in math, reading and writing, as well as how effectively they use all three to understand the Wynne governmentÃÂs fiscal record. Luckily, the Premier said, they ÃÂdid not.ÃÂ

ÃÂIÃÂm so, so proud of our children. Not only do they lack the skills to compare the magnitudes of dollar amounts and to interpret debt-vs-time graphs, but their subpar performance on division questions means they will not be able to burden themselves with the correct knowledge of our increasing debt-to-GDP ratio.ÃÂ

When asked about the fifty percent of students who did well, Wynne added, ÃÂThereÃÂs more than enough time before their next EQAO test to ensure they satisfy the provincial standard of complacency with questionable spending practices.ÃÂ"	0
286	"An anonymous ÃÂJane DoeÃÂ filed a federal lawsuit against GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump last week, accusing him of raping her in 1994 when she was thirteen years old. The mainstream media ignored the filing.

If the Bill Cosby case has taught us anything, it is to not disregard rape cases against famous men. Serious journalists have publicly apologized for turning a blind eye to the Cosby accusers for over a decade, notwithstanding the large number of women who had come forward with credible claims. And now history is repeating itself.

In covering a story, a media outlet is not finding guilt. It is simply reporting the news that a lawsuit has been filed against Mr. Trump, and ideally putting the complaint in context. Unproven allegations are just that - unproven, and should be identified that way. (Mr. TrumpÃÂs lawyer says the charges are ÃÂcategorically untrue, completely fabricated and politically motivated.ÃÂ) Proof comes later, at trial. But the November election will come well before any trial. And while Mr. Trump is presumed innocent, we are permitted ÃÂ no, we are obligated ÃÂ to analyze the caseÃÂs viability now.

No outsider can say whether Mr. Trump is innocent or guilty of these new rape charges. But we can look at his record, analyze the court filings here, and make a determination as to credibility ÃÂ whether the allegations are believable enough for us to take them seriously and investigate them, keeping in mind his denial and reporting new facts as they develop.

I have done that. And the answer is a clear ÃÂyes.ÃÂ These allegations are credible. They ought not be ignored. Mainstream media, IÃÂm looking at you.

1. Consider the context: Mr. TrumpÃÂs overt, even proud misogyny.

The rape case must be viewed through the lens of Mr. TrumpÃÂs current, longstanding and well documented contempt for women. Men who objectify women are more likely to become perpetrators of sexual violence, just as one with a long history of overtly racist comments is more likely to commit a hate crime.

Mr. Trump has relished calling women ÃÂdogs,ÃÂ ÃÂslobsÃÂ and ÃÂpigs,ÃÂ and cyberstalked and derided journalist Megyn Kelly for having the temerity to ask him to defend his own words. He threw out the most misogynist of attacks, attempting to undermine her professionalism by accusing her of menstruating. HeÃÂs cruelly ridiculed the appearance of a female opponent (Carly Fiorina) and an opponentÃÂs wife (Heidi Cruz). His campaign even openly acknowledged that it disqualified all women for consideration as his vice-president.

Mr. Trump has a long history of debasing women heÃÂs worked with, crossing the line on a regular basis. HeÃÂs taken lifelong joy in objectifying women, including his proclamation: ÃÂWomen, you have to treat ÃÂem like shit.ÃÂ

This cannot be ignored. Decades of abusive language does not make him a rapist. But it does show us who the man is: a callous, meanspirited misogynist who no sane person would leave alone with her daughter. As Dr. Maya Angelou said, ÃÂWhen someone shows you who they really are, believe them.ÃÂ

2. More context: two prior sexual assault court claims have been made against Mr. Trump.

But Mr. Trump has been accused of worse than just misogynist language. Two prior women have accused Mr. Trump, in court documents, of actual or attempted sexual assault. (Mr. Trump denies all the allegations.)

Under oath, Ivana Trump accused Mr. Trump of a violent rape.

First was Ivana Trump, Donald TrumpÃÂs first wife, who said under oath in a 1989 deposition that he had violently attacked her, ripped out her hair and forcibly penetrated her without her consent. According to the Daily Beast, she claims he was wildly angry that sheÃÂd referred him to a cosmetic surgeon who had botched a ÃÂscalp reductionÃÂ job (to cover a bald spot) and caused pain in his scalp - hence the vindictive yanking on her hair. At the time Ms. Trump said she felt ÃÂviolatedÃÂ by the alleged ÃÂrape.ÃÂ

A few years later, after their divorce was settled, Ms. Trump claimed that she did not mean the word ÃÂrapeÃÂ in a ÃÂliteral or criminalÃÂ sense.

Note: virtually every settlement of a case involving a high profile person paying money to a former spouse - or anyone - requires the person receiving the money to agree in writing to ironclad nondisparagement and confidentiality. In plain English: you promise to be quiet and not say anything bad about the party paying you money. This has been the case in hundreds of settlement agreements I have worked on over the years. Ms. Trump was almost certainly contractually prohibited after she signed from saying anything negative about Mr. Trump. And it is also common to attempt to ÃÂcureÃÂ prior negative statements with new agreed-to language - like, I didnÃÂt mean it literally. (You didnÃÂt mean forcible penetration literally?)

A business acquaintance accused Mr. Trump of sexual harassment and ÃÂattempted rape.ÃÂ

A second woman accused Donald Trump of sexual assault, in 1997. According to The Guardian, then 34-year-old Jill Harth alleged in a federal lawsuit that Trump violated her ÃÂphysical and mental integrityÃÂ when he touched her intimately without consent after her husband went into business with him, leaving her ÃÂemotionally devastated [and] distraught.ÃÂ The lawsuit called the multiple acts ÃÂattempted rape.ÃÂ Shortly thereafter she voluntarily withdrew the case when a parallel suit against Mr. Trump brought by her husband was settled. When The Guardian reached the woman in 2016 to ask whether she stood by her sexual assault allegations, she responded, ÃÂyes.ÃÂ

In a court filing, according to a report, Ms. Harth alleged that while she and her husband were trying to do a business deal with Mr. Trump regarding a beauty pageant, he repeatedly propositioned her for sex and groped her, culminating in this frightening alleged incident:

Trump forcefully removed (Harth) from public areas of Mar-A-Lago in Florida and forced (her) into a bedroom belonging to defendantÃÂs daughter Ivanka, wherein (Trump) forcibly kissed, fondled, and restrained (her) from leaving, against (her) will and despite her protests.ÃÂ In the court document, she said that Trump bragged that he ÃÂwould be the best lover you ever have.ÃÂ

Recently Donald Trump issued a statement that womenÃÂs claims of sexual harassment, documented in a lengthy New York Times investigation which included Ms. HarthÃÂs lawsuit, were ÃÂmade up.ÃÂ

Jill Harth responded angrily on Twitter last week: ÃÂMy part was true. I didnÃÂt talk. As usual you opened your big mouth.ÃÂ 

In other words, she is standing by her story.

3. The new Jane Doe child rape claim against Mr. Trump is consistent with verifiable facts about Mr. Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein, and has a powerful witness statement attached to it.

A third woman accused Mr. Trump of rape very recently. According to the Daily Mail, a woman filed an April 2016 lawsuit claiming that when she was thirteen years old she was held as a sex slave to Mr. Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein. The woman claimed to have a witness, ÃÂTiffany Doe,ÃÂ to the incidents. She filed the case in pro per, that is, without the assistance of a lawyer.

The case was dismissed by the court for technical filing errors. She then obtained a lawyer and the case was modified and refiled in New York federal court, against Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein.

IÃÂve carefully reviewed this federal complaint. It is now much stronger than the one she filed on her own, which makes sense because she now has an experienced litigator representing her. Jane Doe says that as a 13-year-old, she was enticed to attend parties at the home of Jeffrey Epstein with the promise of money modeling jobs. Mr. Epstein is a notorious ÃÂbillionaire pedophileÃÂ who is now a Level 3 registered sex offender ÃÂ the most dangerous kind, ÃÂa threat to public safetyÃÂ ÃÂ after being convicted of misconduct with another underage girl.

Jane Doe says that Mr. Trump ÃÂinitiated sexual contactÃÂ with her on four occasions in 1994. Since she was thirteen at the time, consent is not an issue. If Mr. Trump had any type of sexual contact with her in 1994, it was a crime.

On the fourth incident, she says Mr. Trump tied her to a bed and forcibly raped her, in a ÃÂsavage sexual attack,ÃÂ while she pleaded with him to stop. She says Mr. Trump violently struck her in the face. She says that afterward, if she ever revealed what he had done, Mr. Trump threatened that she and her family would be ÃÂphysically harmed if not killed.ÃÂ She says she has been in fear of him ever since.

New YorkÃÂs five year statute of limitations on this claim ÃÂ the legal deadline for filing ÃÂ has long since run. However, Jane DoeÃÂs attorney, Thomas Meagher, argues in his court filing that because she was threatened by Mr. Trump, she has been under duress all this time, and therefore she should be permitted additional time to come forward. Legally, this is calling ÃÂtollingÃÂ ÃÂ stopping the clock, allowing more time to file the case. As a result, the complaint alleges, Jane Doe did not have ÃÂfreedom of will to institute suit earlier in time.ÃÂ He cites two New York cases which I have read and which do support tolling

Two unusual documents are attached to Jane DoeÃÂs complaints ÃÂ sworn declarations attesting to the facts. The first is from Jane Doe herself, telling her horrific story, including the allegation that Jeffrey Epstein also raped her and threatened her into silence, and this stunner:

Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who took my virginity, not Defendant Trump . . .

And this one:

Defendant Trump stated that I shouldnÃÂt ever say anything if I didnÃÂt want to disappear like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third incident, and that he was capable of having my whole family killed.

The second declaration is even more astonishing, because it is signed by ÃÂTiffany Doe,ÃÂ Mr. EpsteinÃÂs ÃÂparty plannerÃÂ from 1991-2000. Tiffany Doe says that her duties were ÃÂto get attractive adolescent women to attend these parties.ÃÂ (Adolescents are, legally, children.

Tiffany Doe says that she recruited Jane Doe at the Port Authority in New York, persuaded her to attend Mr. EpsteinÃÂs parties, and actually witnessed the sexual assaults on Jane Doe:

I personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were advised that she was 13 years old.

It is exceedingly rare for a sexual assault victim to have a witness. But Tiffany Doe says:

I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop.

Tiffany Doe corroborates, based on her own personal observations, just about everything in Jane DoeÃÂs complaint: that 12-year-old Maria was involved in a sex act with Mr. Trump, that Mr. Trump threatened the life of Jane Doe if she ever revealed what happened, and that she would ÃÂdisappearÃÂ like Maria if she did.

Tiffany Doe herself says that she is in mortal fear of Mr. Trump to this day:
I am coming forward to swear to the truthfulness of the physical and sexual abuse that I personally witnessed of minor females at the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein . . . I swear to these facts under the penalty for perjury even though I fully understand that the life of myself and my family is now in grave danger.

Given all this, and based on the record thus far, Jane DoeÃÂs claims appear credible. Mr. EpsteinÃÂs own sexual crimes and parties with underage girls are well documented, as is Mr. TrumpÃÂs relationship with him two decades ago in New York City. Mr. Trump told a reporter a few years ago: ÃÂIÃÂve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. HeÃÂs a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys his social life.ÃÂ

Powerfully, Jane Doe appears to have an eyewitness to all aspects of her claim, a witness who appears to have put herself in substantial danger by coming forward, because at a minimum Mr. Epstein knows her true identity.

Jane Doe has not granted any interviews, and we donÃÂt know anything about her background, or Tiffany DoeÃÂs, or the details of their stories. Much information needs to be revealed to fully assess this case. Perhaps they will be discredited on cross-examination. Perhaps they will recant. But if weÃÂre going to speculate in that direction, we should speculate in the other direction as well. Perhaps Jane Doe and her lawyer will have more evidence and witnesses to corroborate her claim. Perhaps witnesses from Mr. EpsteinÃÂs notorious parties will come forward. We just canÃÂt know any of that at this point.

But based on what we do know now, Jane DoeÃÂs claims fall squarely into the long, ugly context of Mr. TrumpÃÂs life of misogyny, are consistent with prior sexual misconduct claims, are backed up by an eyewitness, and thus should be taken seriously. Her claims merit sober consideration and investigation.

We live in a world where wealthy, powerful men often use and abuse women and girls. While these allegations may shock some, as a lawyer who represents women in sexual abuse cases every day, I can tell you that sadly, they are common, as is an accuserÃÂs desire to remain anonymous, and her terror in coming forward.

What do you call a nation that refuses to even look at sexual assault claims against a man seeking to lead the free world?

Rape culture.

We ignore the voices of women at our peril."	0
287	"The presidential candidates have wildly varying tax proposals.

Donald Trump and Ted Cruz propose massive cuts that would greatly reduce federal income taxes on everyone, especially the wealthy, while cutting a wide host of government programs. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders proposes virtually the opposite: tax increases on everyone, with hikes on the wealthy especially, while adding comprehensive government programs. And Hillary Clinton proposes much smaller tax increases, all focused on the rich.

But what do their plans mean for your federal tax liability?

We partnered with the Tax Policy Center to create a calculator that will estimate how each presidential candidate's tax plan would affect you ÃÂ or, more accurately, people like you. For example, if you are part of a couple with two children earning $38,000 a year, this calculator tells you the average change in federal taxes for all couples with two children who earn between $35,000 and $40,000 a year.

Before you change your vacation plans based on these numbers, keep in mind they are only estimates. Every taxpayer has a slightly different situation ÃÂ someone might be deducting business expenses, for example, while another person will be paying a tax for not carrying insurance coverage. This creates millions of different scenarios.

Accounting for all of that is prohibitively complicated and time-consuming. But what we have done is simplify the process to consider only the biggest factors (income, marital status, and children) and only look at the four taxes with the largest impact (individual and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and excise taxes).

Try it yourself below.

(Note: The Tax Policy Center did not perform an analysis of John Kasich's tax plan because his plan lacks sufficient detail to model. They have reached out to the Kasich campaign in search of more details, and will analyze the plan if they receive enough information to do so.)

The calculator: How much does each candidate's tax plan affect you?

Read this: Ezra wrote a piece about what the tax calculator tells us about the candidates. On Cruz and Trump, he writes:

In a sense, both GOP candidates are gaming the calculator: They've proposed tremendous cuts, but without knowing who will pay for those cuts, it's hard to know who will truly be helped and who will be badly hurt.
On Sanders, he writes:

Sanders, meanwhile, proposes to raise taxes by more than Trump proposes to cut them. But it's wrong, I think, to view Sanders's plan as primarily a change to America's tax code. The huge tax increases are a byproduct of Sanders's plans to nationalize major sectors of American life.
Read the full analysis here.

Update on why rates are higher than you think: We've been getting a lot of questions about why your current effective tax rate is so high. Here's a note from Tax Policy Center director Len Burman that explains why this is happening:

You might be surprised at how much taxes youÃÂre paying under current law. WeÃÂre including payroll taxes, excise taxes, and corporate income taxes as well as individual income taxes. Most working people actually pay more in payroll tax than income tax. And they pay much more if you include the employerÃÂs portion of the tax. Most economists think employers pass their share of the tax on to workers in the form of lower wages.
Update, plus a FAQ section: To calculate the tax rate, we originally used adjusted gross income (AGI), but we decided to switch over to expanded cash income (ECI), because this measure includes income that is not subject to income tax, like health insurance premiums paid by employers. This allows the calculator to provide a more accurate view of your tax rate. For a longer explanation, read this Q&A.

What we learned from our calculator
Play around with different incomes other than your own to get a better idea of how each candidate deals with the poor, middle class, and wealthy.

In short, what you'll see is:

Clinton proposes keeping things mostly the same.
Sanders wants to implement massive increases across the board, including on the poor.
Cruz and Trump propose big cuts for everyone ÃÂ but the wealthier you are, the more you keep in your pocket.
But how does this affect how much money the federal government brings in?
It's one thing to know how your taxes will change, but you can't view it in a vacuum. What the federal government does can affect your bottom line, too.

For example, Bernie Sanders's plan would raise taxes on everyone, but it would also pay for health care, education, and other programs that you would no longer have to pay for. And it goes the other way, too. If Donald Trump's tax plan was implemented, everyone would get a tax cut, but it also means government services would be cut, so you would have to pay for them yourself.

So this is how each candidate deals with this balance:

Donald Trump: His plan would cut federal revenues by an estimated $9.5 trillion over the next decade. Cuts would be across the board, but most cuts would be for wealthier households. His tax cuts promise to stimulate economic growth and reduce government spending, which could cause households to pay more for services that are currently subsidized by the government. (Here are more details on Trump's plan.)

Ted Cruz: His plan would cut federal revenues by an estimated $8.6 trillion over the next decade. Much like Trump's plan, cuts would be across the board, but most cuts are for wealthier households. His tax cuts promise to stimulate economic growth and reduce government spending, which could cause households to pay more for services that are currently subsidized by the government. (Here are more details on Cruz's plan.)

Hillary Clinton: Her plan would raise federal revenues by an additional $1.1 trillion over the next decade. Most increases would be for wealthier households, while lower-income households aren't affected much. The additional revenues will pay for programs that benefit many Americans. (Here are more details on Clinton's plan.)

Bernie Sanders: His plan would raise federal revenues by an estimated $15.3 trillion over the next decade. He would raise taxes for almost all households, but most increases would be for wealthier households; tax increases would be small for lower- and middle-income households. Additional revenues would pay for health care, education, and other programs, so households would pay less than what they currently pay for those services. (Here are more details on Sanders's plan.)"	0
288	"Top ISIS leader now believed to be the number two behind the terrorist organization, Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani, put up a video this week following the second presidential debate asking American Muslim voters to support Hillary Clinton.

The controversial video that was taken down by YouTube only hours after it was uploaded showed top ISIS leader Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani threatening those who would decide to vote for Donald Trump and calling them ÃÂinfidelsÃÂ and ÃÂgoat fÃÂ-ersÃÂ.

ÃÂ All Muslims who will show support for the dog-faced Trump are guilty of masiya (mortal sin) ÃÂ

Supporting the ÃÂdog-facedÃÂ Trump

Al-alwani also warned all Muslims not to take his warnings lightly and that supporters of Trump would be severely punished on earth and in Jannah (afterlife).

ÃÂTrump is a dog, he is the scum of the earth. He boasts that he will take our oil and join Russia, Syria and the Shia Iranians against us in our holy fightÃÂ he added, visibly angry.

ÃÂThis (dog-faced) scumbag must not reach Washington. Although it is a sin to put an inferior being such as a woman into a position of power, it is the true plan of Satan to divide the Muslims of America. It would be dirty and danis (filthy) to vote for Trump,ÃÂ he explained.

289	"CLEMSON, S.C. (SatireWire.com) ÃÂ Donald TrumpÃÂs increasingly toxic rhetoric reached its natural conclusion today as the Republican presidential frontrunner finished an explosive rant against Muslims, immigrants, minorities and the media by taking an actual shit on stage.

The crowd at a South Carolina rally initially fell silent, but quickly found its voice after realizing the candidate had, in that moment, managed to sum up his gritty campaign.

ÃÂWow, that was like everything heÃÂs ever said put into solid form!ÃÂ gushed 24-year-old Ty Leveren of Aiken, S.C.

ÃÂHe just did what weÃÂre all thinking!ÃÂ added 55-year-old Randy Loafen of Columbia.


TrumpÃÂs seemingly spontaneous evacuation came at the end of a particularly inflammatory 30-minute speech that simultaneously wound up his followers and unwound his bowels.


ÃÂNo one likes me saying it, but IÃÂll say it,ÃÂ Trump told about 2,000 supporters. ÃÂMuslims are evil, OK? Minorities are dangerous. Protesters? Horrible people. And worse than all that, Time magazine named that fat loser Angela Merkel as ÃÂPerson of the Year!ÃÂ Not me, Angela Merkel!


ÃÂDoesnÃÂt that make you angry?ÃÂ he went on. ÃÂDoesnÃÂt that make you furious? In fact, doesnÃÂt everything I say just make you want toÃÂ toÃÂ hold on. IÃÂll show you!ÃÂ


Trump then lowered his suit pants to his ankles, leaned over his podium, and defecated.


Sensing unease in the silence that followed, the candidate quickly took control, strutting around the stage and nodding at his handiwork.


ÃÂFirst of all, I have to say, wow, thatÃÂs a great crap,ÃÂ Trump said. ÃÂMaybe the best crap ever? People will say that. Because I crap like nobodyÃÂs business, thatÃÂs how good I am at crapping. IÃÂm full up to here with it. Doctors ÃÂ the best specialists ÃÂ have told me that. They say, ÃÂDonald, youÃÂre so amazing. YouÃÂre so full of crap.ÃÂ So yeah, great, great crap.


ÃÂBut that steaming pile on the floor is more than that, folks,ÃÂ he continued. ÃÂThat incredible, steaming pile of billionaire gold is my message. ThatÃÂs what I say about Islam! ThatÃÂs what I say about liberal America! ThatÃÂs what I say about Time magazine! That, folks, is what I have said, and will continue to say, right up to the day IÃÂm sworn in as your next president!ÃÂ


The crowd then burst into cheers, replacing its usual chant of ÃÂTrump! Trump! Trump!ÃÂ with shouts of, ÃÂDump! Dump! Dump!ÃÂ But the business mogul demurred.


ÃÂFolks folks folks, please, I canÃÂt,ÃÂ he intoned. ÃÂIÃÂve got to save some. IÃÂve got other rallies today. But trust me, when I leave here, IÃÂm going to shit on Iowa, IÃÂm going to shit on New Hampshire, and when IÃÂm elected, IÃÂm going to shit on the whole country!ÃÂ


After the rally, Trump followers were ecstatic.


ÃÂTrump is the real deal,ÃÂ said Cheryl Cramhoster of Mt. Pleasant, S.C. ÃÂYou know where he stands, and now we even know what he had for breakfast!ÃÂ


Karen Everton, 66, who drove to the rally from North Carolina, said the crude delivery of TrumpÃÂs message would not dampen her enthusiasm for his presidential bid.


ÃÂI donÃÂt know why he did it, but it makes me love him even more,ÃÂ she said. ÃÂItÃÂs like, Donald Trump doesnÃÂt just say shit, he does shit. He literally does shit.ÃÂ"	0
290	"Another long-time ÃÂloverÃÂ of Bill Clinton has come forth, with a new book, Hillary, The Other Woman (WND Books), spilling beans on his insatiable satyriasis and HillaryÃÂs hell-bent political ambitions.

She is Dolly Kyle, an attorney in her 60s, who first met Bill Clinton in Arkansas in the summer of 1959 when she was 11 years old and he 12. Supposedly, it was love at first sight ÃÂ a sexual relationship that lasted 32 years ÃÂ through high school (although she says they didnÃÂt have sex until after graduation), BillÃÂs law school at Yale, his years as Arkansas governor, and until his entrance into the White House.

Dolly Kyle in 1998

Dolly Kyle in 1998

This is what Dolly Kyle wrote in her book (source: Daily Mail):

(1) In 1987, Bill Clinton had had 2,000 sex partners:

Dolly said she started ÃÂsleeping with BillÃÂ after high school and admits ÃÂBilly was a sex addict; I was a codependentÃÂ. In 1987, Bill Clinton was ÃÂundoneÃÂ by Wilt ChamberlainÃÂs claim to have slept with 20,000 women. Bill told Dolly, ÃÂThatÃÂs ten times more than IÃÂve had!ÃÂ ÃÂ which meant Bill had sex with 2,000 women in 1987, which means that the number would be even higher by 2016.

Hey, Dolly Kyle, thatÃÂs some ÃÂloveÃÂ Bill Clinton had for you!

(2) Bill Clinton had wanted to be president since high school:

Bill first confessed his desire to be president to Dolly back in high school, and began actively pursuing it after the summer of 1963 when, as an Arkansas delegate to Boys Nation, he had a photo-op with President John F Kennedy in the Rose Garden.

(3) Bill Clinton called blacks ÃÂniggersÃÂ:

Dolly wrote that she frequently had heard Bill refer to blacks in the South as ÃÂG**damn n****rÃÂ.

(4) Bill Clinton never used a condom, but seemingly was unconcerned because, as he told Dolly, he had a low sperm count. (Note: Other reports say Bill Clinton is sterile from mumps.)

(5) It was a marriage of convenience ÃÂ of Bill and Hillary using each other:

HillaryÃÂs role was financial provider to get Bill elected president, and pursue ÃÂhis addictions to politics, power and sexÃÂ. BillÃÂs mother, too, had supported the family financially while his stepfather drank. Dolly wrote: ÃÂHillaryÃÂs role of providing financial security for Billy was part of her motivation for the series of financial crimes (yes, crimes) that she committed over the decades. Hillary was upholding her part of the deal to get Billy elected president, after which it would be her turn to be the first woman in the Oval Office.ÃÂ

(6) Bill Clinton called Hillary his ÃÂwardenÃÂ:

Hillary kept BillÃÂs nose clean in the public mind and had private investigators tracking Bill and the ÃÂwomen he was dating or attackingÃÂ because she was riding his coattails to political power. Dolly writes: ÃÂHillary needs the powerÃÂ and she is ruthless.

(7) Hillary was sweaty and had hairy calves and toes:

Dolly first met Hillary on the evening of May 28, 1974 at the airport in Little Rock. It was election night and Senator William Fulbright was running for re-election. Fulright was Bill ClintonÃÂs champion ÃÂ giving Bill his first Senate job while Bill attended Georgetown University; supporting him for the Rhodes Scholarship and a teaching job at Arkansas Law School; introducing him to powerful people in Washington and financial backers for BillÃÂs first congressional campaign that he eventually lost.

Dolly describes Hillary as ÃÂa dowdy-looking woman who appeared to be middle-agedÃÂ with ÃÂthick eyebrows melded together stretching across her forehead,ÃÂ wearing ÃÂcoke-bottle-thick lensesÃÂ and ÃÂa misshapen, brown, dress-like thing that must have been intended to hide her lumpy body. The garment was long, but stopped too soon to hide her fat ankles and her thick calves covered with black hair. Thick brown sandals did nothing to conceal her wide feet and the hair on her toesÃÂ.

Hillary glared at Dolly with hostility. Dolly writes: ÃÂIn that moment, I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering odor of perspiration and greasy hair. I hoped that I wouldnÃÂt gag when she got in the car.ÃÂ When Bill introduced the dowdy woman as Hillary, Dolly ÃÂwas stunnedÃÂ and thought ÃÂit was ÃÂsome kind of a sick jokeÃÂ ÃÂ a woman in a hideous disguise.ÃÂ

(8) Bill discarded his mentor-benefactor Sen. Fulbright when the latter lost reelection:

Dolly writes that although the plan had been to go the FulbrightÃÂs campaign headquarters, when the votes came in showing he was losing, Hillary signaled to Bill and the plan was changed. He would head back to the airport. Bill told Dolly, ÃÂI donÃÂt want to be seen with a loser.ÃÂ

(9) HillaryÃÂs attempt to carve a political career for herself in Washington sizzled:

A lawyer and graduate of Yale, Hillary wanted a career in Washington but she flunked the DC bar exam. Dolly writes that at the time of her meeting Hillary for the first time, Hillary was working in Washington, DC and ÃÂtrying to become a political force under her own steam.ÃÂ But ÃÂIt was a futile attemptÃÂ and HillaryÃÂs job with the Watergate investigation ended. Dolly believes ÃÂHillary showed the same lack of integrity there that would later get her into more serious trouble.ÃÂ (See ÃÂHillary Clinton was fired for lying when she was 27 years oldÃÂ)

(10) Hillary was a lesbian:

Although Bill did not use the word ÃÂlesbian,ÃÂ he hinted at it by keep referring to HillaryÃÂs ÃÂlifestyleÃÂ.

In March 1979, Bill told Dolly he wanted a child but had a low sperm count: ÃÂWe need to have a baby so we can appear to be a normal couple. We need to do something serious to take attention off the WardenÃÂs lifestyle.ÃÂ He asked Dolly to pray for a baby. Dolly suggested he had to bite the bullet and sleep with Hillary. Within a year, Chelsea Victoria Clinton was born and Bill fell head over heels with the little baby. (See ÃÂBill Clinton not ChelseaÃÂs biological fatherÃÂ)

But Hillary felt trapped being at home with a baby and couldnÃÂt wait to get back to work. She asked her friend, Louise: ÃÂHow long do I have to stay at home with this kid?ÃÂ Hillary stayed home with baby Chelsea for three months before returning to work. Bill told to Dolly that it was the baby that kept the couple together.

(11) HillaryÃÂs other attractive qualities:

Hillary resented that she had to dress like Southern women; she visited dress shops but generally didnÃÂt buy anything. Dolly also confirms Secret Service agentsÃÂ accounts of HillaryÃÂs foul mouth, anger towards the White House and Arkansas governor security detail, and physical abuse of Bill. In Arkansas, she had ÃÂhissy fitsÃÂ and threw dishes at Bill in the kitchen, breaking a kitchen cabinet door. When Bill lost the governorship after one year, Hillary was furious, knowing that she was no longer the stateÃÂs First Lady and had to move out of the governorÃÂs mansion and into a tiny house. (See ÃÂEx-Secret Service agent: Jekyll & Hyde personality makes Hillary unfit to be PresidentÃÂ)

Dolly writes: ÃÂHillary is not a leader. She is a coattail-clutcher who has a litany of jobs with no accomplishments,ÃÂ having failed as co-president, failed as senator ÃÂunless you are impressed with the bills she introduced to name a couple of post offices,ÃÂ failed as secretary of state and as a defender of women over the past 40 years. Hillary instigated threats on women who had sex with her husband, a serial sex abuser.

(12) DollyÃÂs summary opinion of the Clintons:

Despite her long, 32-year sexual (itÃÂs true love!) relationship with Bill Clinton, Dolly Kyle has only contempt for the Clintons. She writes:

ÃÂBilly and Hillary Clinton continue to be lying, cheating, manipulative, scratching, clawing, ruthlessly aggressive, insatiably ambitious politicians who are giving public service a bad name ÃÂ and nothing about them has changed in the past forty-plus years, except that they have deluded more and more people. The Clintons and their misled supporters have rewritten history to suit their political agenda, which is to get votes to get power to get money to get more power to get more money. The ClintonsÃÂ vicious cycle of intertwining greed and power addictions will have no limit, unless someone stands up and announces. The emperor has no clothes! Ideology, integrity, and love of country were never involved in the ÃÂBillaryÃÂ quest for the White House. It was always a codependent, co-conspiratorial grab for money and power and more money and more power. Unfortunately for them and for the United States of America, there is never enough to satisfy addicts.ÃÂ"	1
291	"CLEVELAND (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂAfter being told that he did not poll well enough to participate in ThursdayÃÂs nationally televised Republican Presidential debate, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal told reporters that it was ÃÂno big deal, seriously,ÃÂ because ÃÂI didnÃÂt want to be in that lame debate anyway.ÃÂ

ÃÂI mean, at first it sounded like the debate might be cool, but, you know, the more I looked at it, it seemed like it was going to be pretty lame,ÃÂ Jindal said. ÃÂI mean, look at some of the people who got chosen to do itÃÂlike Ted Cruz. I mean, seriously, Ted freaking Cruz? ThatÃÂs going to be a lame debate.ÃÂ

Jindal said that, instead of participating in the debate, he was going to host a party for the other Republican candidates who were not chosen for it.
ÃÂI just sent out the Evite, and itÃÂs looking good,ÃÂ Jindal said. ÃÂCarly Fiorina, in. Rick Perry, in. That dude who used to be the governor of New York, in. I seriously just sent out the Evite, and all these awesome people are yeses.ÃÂ

ÃÂWeÃÂre going to have loads of snacks, and, yes, adult beverages will be served,ÃÂ Jindal said of the festivities. ÃÂItÃÂs going to be a righteous party, and way better than being at some lame debate.ÃÂ"	0

Joe Nocera in the New York Times quoting Harold BursonÃÂs scripts from the Nuremberg trials.

It happened because of prison overcrowding. Prison overcrowding creates unconstitutional conditions for inmates. Anything that can be done to relieve those unconstitutional conditions is welcome.

For those who have not paid much attention to prison overcrowding, the U.S. Supreme Court case of Brown v. Plata is an eye opener. Although it affects only the California prison system, it focuses attention on overcrowded conditions in state and federal prisons alike. Writing for the majority in that case, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said that California prisons were designed to house a population of 80,000 but that the population was close to double that. ÃÂPrisonersÃÂ he said, ÃÂare crammed into spaces neither designed nor intended to house inmates... [S]uicidal inmates may be held for prolonged periods in telephone booth sized cages without toilets ÃÂ and the lack of care results in ÃÂneedless suffering and death.ÃÂ Stating the often overlooked but obvious truism, Justice Kennedy says that even though incarcerated, ÃÂPrisoners retain the essence of human dignity inherent in all persons. Respect for that dignity animates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.ÃÂ He concludes his opinion saying that ÃÂThe medical and mental health care provided by CaliforniaÃÂs prisons falls below the standard of decency that inheres in the Eighth Amendment.ÃÂ

Overcrowding is a problem in federal prisons as well. According to The Crime Report, when the U.S. Attorney for Atlanta, Sally Quillian Yates, was testifying before the U.S. Sentencing Commission in Washington in late May 2010, she said that federal facilities are currently operating at 34 percent above capacity. In her testimony she said that the overcrowding will have ÃÂreal and detrimental consequences for the safety of prisoners.ÃÂ Her concerns are echoed by Bryan Lowry, president of the American Federation of Government EmployeesÃÂ Council of Prison Locals. Testifying before a House Appropriations subcommittee in 2010 he pointed out to the committee that between June 2008 and the time of his testimony in March 2010, there were 340 inmate-on-staff assaults in federal prisons nationwide. He told the committee that ÃÂThese aggressive acts by inmates against staff illustrate a common reality facing staff daily at their workplace. Federal prisons have continued to be increasingly dangerous places to work, primarily because of serious correctional worker understaffing and prison inmate overcrowding problems.ÃÂ And that all serves to highlight what we learned from the Platt case. Overcrowding violates the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment that is proscribed by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It also helps explain the death of Anwar al-Awlaki, the United States citizen who was summarily executed by the United States Government because he had been designated a terrorist.

Mr. Awlaki was killed September 30 in Yemen by a missile fired from a United States operated drone aircraft. Mr. Awlaki spent the first seven years of his life in Las Cruces New Mexico. His family moved to Yemen where he lived until he was 19 when he returned to the United States to attend college. Following his graduation he became an Imam at assorted mosques in the United States. Eventually he became a fiery preacher advocating the mass murder of American citizens.

In early 2010 the U.S. government said his actions made him a justifiable target for capture or death. His father objected to the fact that his son had been made death penalty eligible without having been tried or convicted of any offense. Aided by the ACLU he went to court alleging that the actions of the government in authorizing his sonÃÂs summary execution violated the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution. The judge threw out the lawsuit although he said that the actions of the government raised ÃÂstark, and perplexing, questionsÃÂ one of which was whether the president could ÃÂorder the assassination of a U.S. citizen without first affording him any form of judicial process whatsoever, based [on] the mere assertion that he is a dangerous member of a terrorist organization.ÃÂ The question has now been answered. It can, it did and Mr. Awlaki is now dead.

In making its decision to kill Mr. Awlaki, it is clear that the Obama administration was addressing two competing interests. If Mr. Awlaki was captured and sent to prison his 5th Amendment due process rights would be preserved but the other prisonersÃÂ 8th Amendment rights would be impinged by increasing the overcrowding. By killing him the administration was violating the constitutional rights of only one person instead of many. Examined in that light it is obvious that the government made the right decision. It should also cause the rest of the country to wonder how far the administration is willing to go to avoid further prison overcrowding. Time will tell."	0
293	"The gloves are off in the fight between John Kasich and Donald Trump.

Well, technically they've been off since last Friday. But the Kasich campaign released a Web ad Tuesday directly attacked Trump with a darker tone than any other candidate has used so far to go after the business mogul.

The spot features retired Air Force Col. Tom Moe speaking at an event in Ohio, the same day Trump held a rally in Columbus. Moe, who the Kasich campaign identifies as a former Vietnam POW, paraphrases a quote from Protestant pastor Martin NiemÃÂ¶ller, taken from his lectures after World War II.

""You might not care if Donald Trump says Muslims should register with their government, because you're not one,"" says Moe, to an ominous soundtrack. ""And you might not care if Donald Trump says he's going to round up all the Hispanic immigrants, because you're not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump says it's okay to rough up black protesters, because you're not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump wants to suppress journalists, because you're not one. But think about this: If he keeps going, and he actually becomes president, he might just get around to you. And you better hope there's someone left to help you.""

The new spot came just a day after both the campaign and the super PAC supporting Kasich released a pair of spots attacking the GOP front-runner -- and hours after the candidates' latest Twitter spat:

Later Monday, Kasich wound up a day-long anti-Trump tweetstorm with a challenge:"	0
294	"Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offenderÃÂs infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the ÃÂLolita ExpressÃÂ -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com.

ClintonÃÂs presence aboard Jeffrey EpsteinÃÂs Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including ÃÂTatiana.ÃÂ The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.

ÃÂBill Clinton ÃÂ associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile,ÃÂ said Conchita Sarnoff, of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and author of a book on the Epstein case called ""TrafficKing."" ÃÂWhy would a former president associate with a man like that?ÃÂ

Virginia Roberts, 32, who claims she was pimped out by Epstein at age 15, has previously claimed she saw Clinton at EpsteinÃÂs getaway in 2002, but logs do not show Clinton aboard any flights to St. Thomas, the nearest airport capable of accommodating Epstein's plane. They do show Clinton flying aboard EpsteinÃÂs plane to such destinations as Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, China, Brunei, London, New York, the Azores, Belgium, Norway, Russia and Africa.

Among those regularly traveling with Clinton were EpsteinÃÂs associates, New York socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and EpsteinÃÂs assistant, Sarah Kellen, both of whom were investigated by the FBI and Palm Beach Police for recruiting girls for Epstein and his friends.

In response to a separate FOIA request from FoxNews.com, the U.S. Secret Service said it has no records showing agents were ever on the island with Clinton.

A Clinton spokesperson did not return emails requesting comment about the former presidentÃÂs relationship and travels with Epstein. The Clinton Library said it had no relevant information and does not keep track of ClintonÃÂs travel records.

Martin Weinberg, EpsteinÃÂs current attorney, did not respond to multiple inquiries. Epstein said in a court filing said that he and his associates ÃÂhave been the subject of the most outlandish and offensive attacks, allegations, and plain inventions.ÃÂ

Police in Palm Beach, Fla., launched a year-long investigation in 2005 into Epstein after parents of a 14-year-old girl said their daughter was sexually abused by him. Police interviewed dozens of witnesses, confiscated his trash, performed surveillance and searched his Palm Beach mansion, ultimately identifying 20 girls between the ages of 14 and 17 who they said were sexually abused by Epstein.

In 2006, at the request of Palm Beach Police, the FBI launched a federal probe into allegations that Epstein and his personal assistants had ÃÂused facilities of interstate commerce to induce girls between the ages of 14 and 17 to engage in illegal sexual activities.ÃÂ

According to court documents, police investigators found a ÃÂclear indication that EpsteinÃÂs staff was frequently working to schedule multiple young girls between the ages of 12 and 16 years old literally every day, often two or three times per day.ÃÂ

One victim, in sworn deposition testimony, said Epstein began sexually assaulting her when she was 13 years old and molested her on more than 50 occasions over the next three years. The girls testified they were lured to EpsteinÃÂs home after being promised hundreds of dollars to be his model or masseuse, but when they arrived, he ordered them to take off their clothes and massage his naked body while he masturbated and used sex toys on them.

The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prepared charging documents that accused Epstein of child sex abuse, witness tampering and money laundering, but Epstein took a plea deal before an indictment could be handed up.

On Sept. 24, 2007, in a deal shrouded in secrecy that left alleged victims shocked at its leniency, Epstein agreed to a 30-month sentence, including 18 months of jail time and 12 months of house arrest and the agreement to pay dozens of young girls under a federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child sexual abuse.

In exchange, the U.S. AttorneyÃÂs Office promised not to pursue any federal charges against Epstein or his co-conspirators.

Florida attorney Brad Edwards, who represented some of EpsteinÃÂs alleged victims, is suing the federal government over the secret non-prosecution agreement in hopes of having it overturned. Edwards claimed in court records that the government and Epstein concealed the deal from the victims ÃÂto prevent them from voicing any objection, and to avoid the firestorm of controversy that would have arisen if it had become known that the Government was immunizing a politically-connected billionaire and all of his co-conspirators from prosecution of hundreds of federal sex crimes against minor girls.ÃÂ

The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida did not respond to a request for comment about the deal.

Other politicians, celebrities and businessmen, including presidential candidate Donald Trump, have been accused of fraternizing with Epstein. Trump lawyer Alan Garten told FoxNews.com in a statement Trump and Epstein are not pals.

ÃÂThere was no relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂThey were not friends and they did not socialize together.ÃÂ"	0
295	"OTTAWA ÃÂ At a press conference on Thursday the federal government announced that they would replace the outmoded first-come first-serve immigration application process with a global  rock-paper-scissors competition.

ÃÂPlayers compete by simultaneously making one of three shapes with their fingers and outstretched hands.

ÃÂThis government is simply taking a much-needed common sense approach,ÃÂ stated McCallum. ÃÂCanadians tell us they want a process that is fairer for people sponsoring family members, a process that is good enough to end bar disputes over the last pint of a pitcher, a process worthy of determining high stakes life changing decisions such as who has to get up and go to the kitchen for more chips during a Netflix binge.ÃÂ

Minister McCallum stated that the government plans to train hundreds of immigration officers to referee rock-paper-scissors. To address concerns over transparency, the process will be televised on TSN.

This is not the first time Mr. McMahon has been involved in politics. His wife Linda has run for political office on multiple occasions. His experience and notoriety would offer a boost to DonaldÃÂs campaign as it enters the toughest battle he has faced thus far.

298	"RALEIGH (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂDelivering her closing argument of the 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton has replaced her campaign slogan, ÃÂStronger Together,ÃÂ with a new one, ÃÂWonÃÂt Blow Up Planet.ÃÂ

According to Clinton-campaign sources, the new slogan is designed to appeal to suburban women, a group of voters that has historically opposed blowing up the planet.

Clinton launched the slogan at a campaign appearance in Raleigh, North Carolina, where she told supporters, ÃÂOn Day One of my Administration, I will work for you. I will fight for you. And I will not blow up the planet.ÃÂ

299	"Donald Trump said again on Sunday that he is ÃÂopen-mindedÃÂ about climate change -- but also that ÃÂnobody really knowsÃÂ the truth about the issue, which contradicts the fact that there is near-universal scientific agreement on the issue.

In an interview with ÃÂFox News Sunday,ÃÂ moderator Chris Wallace pointed out to Mr. Trump  that in the space of a week he bothmet with former Vice President Al Gore and appointed Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a climate change denier who has opposed many environmental regulations, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Where, Wallace asked, does Mr. Trump stands on climate change?

ÃÂIÃÂm very open-minded. IÃÂm still open-minded,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂNobody really knows.ÃÂ

However, there is a near-universal scientific consensus that climate change is a real phenomenon -- despite continued opposition to the notion among primarily Republican politicians. NASAÃÂs website on climate change, for example, notes that approximately 97 percent of publishing climate scientists agree that human activities are very likely responsible for rising temperatures.

His comments came just days after his transition team created a questionnaire with 74 questions for Energy Department officials to identify employees who had been involved in international climate talks over the last five years, as well as employees who have helped develop Obama administration climate policies.

The questionnaire, obtained by CBS News and first reported by Bloomberg News, asks, for example, ÃÂWhich programs within [the Department of Energy] are essential to meeting the goals of President ObamaÃÂs Climate Action Plan?ÃÂ

Mr. TrumpÃÂs answer Sunday on the climate change issue is similar to the one he gave in a meeting with the editorial board of The New York Times last month -- after a campaign in which Mr. Trump repeatedly insisted climate change was a ÃÂhoaxÃÂ invented by China.

ÃÂI have a very open mind,ÃÂ he said at the time. ÃÂAnd IÃÂm going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and weÃÂre going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind.ÃÂ

Still, Mr. Trump said his reason for choosing Pruitt -- whom many environmental groups immediately blasted -- was to ÃÂspeed up the processÃÂ for permit approvals and other EPA business.

ÃÂIf you look at what ChinaÃÂs doing. If you look at what -- I could name country after country,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂYou look at whatÃÂs happening in Mexico where our people are just -- plants are being built and they donÃÂt wait 10 years to get an approval to build a plant, okay? They build it like the following day or the following week. We canÃÂt let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs.ÃÂ

As for the Paris Agreement, the landmark international climate agreement that went into effect this fall, Mr. Trump said he is ÃÂstudyingÃÂ the agreement -- but that he worries it will put the U.S. at a ÃÂcompetitive disadvantage.ÃÂ International energy and environment experts worry that Mr. Trump, who said earlier this year that he would ÃÂtear upÃÂ the Paris deal, could throw the entire agreement into jeopardy.

ÃÂParis, IÃÂm studying,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂI do say this: I donÃÂt want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries. And as you know, there are different times and different time limits on that agreement. I donÃÂt want that to give China, or other countries signing agreements an advantage over us.ÃÂ"	0

301	"It turns out that the election may have been rigged after all. ItÃÂs just that Hillary Clinton and her Democrats canÃÂt do any job right.

Entire precincts surrounding Detroit may be un-recountable, due to suspected voter fraud! Officials have found that, in hundreds of cases, the poll book numbers do not match the electronic voting machine printouts, as per The Detroit News.

Michigan state law holds that if a precinct is unable to be recounted, then the original count must stand.

Some of the problems may be due to biased elections staff. The machines used in Michigan, according to Detroit Elections Director Daniel Baxter, are quite old. In fact, 87 of the machinesÃÂ optical scanners broke on election day.

When there is such a problem with the machines, a ballot may get jammed in the scanner. The election staff then has to pull the ballot out and try again. This could result in a ballot being counted twice, or even six times, as the staff tries to get the ballot into the machine again and again.

The staff can manually erase the duplicate votes, but Baxter says that ÃÂin many cases, [they] failed to do so.ÃÂ What, they forgot? Or perhaps they wanted to count the vote multiple times?

Of course, many of these precincts are strongly Democrat, at least according to historic voting trends. This includes Wayne County where Clinton received roughly two-thirds of the vote. If such widespread voter fraud has occurred, perhaps Michigan is a lot less blue than we thought.

There are other explanations for the vote discrepancies as well. As WND is reporting, Republican candidate Ken Crider has been keeping a close eye on his DistrictÃÂs elections process. Crider said, in a Facebook post, ÃÂPennyÃÂs precinct, Detroit Precinct #152, had an unbroken seal and everything looked proper. The tag on the box said 306 and the book said 306 and the ticket said 306, so there should be 306 paper ballots on the box, right?ÃÂ

ÃÂWell, when they pulled out the ballots, the stack seemed short, and when they finished separating the two page ballot to count the presidential page only, guess how many ballots were in the box? 304 no, 299 nope, 200 nada, how about 100 wrong again. There were only exactly 50 paper ballots in a locked sealed box that again was supposed to have 306. HMMMM.ÃÂ Crider is right to point out this mysterious circumstance.

If the seal was unbroken and there were no holes in the ballot box, then why was there an incorrect amount of ballots in there? It would be understandable to be off by one vote, but to be off by hundreds is highly suspicious and points, once again, to the election staff.

In my opinion, each of these staff members should be barred from working elections again. Whether through negligence or intention, something very bad has been going on here.

302	"The 2016 GOP nominating was definitely a slugfest. While Rand Paul would have made a decent nominee, he came out in support of a major policy of the man whoÃÂs been called upon to lead our nation.

ÃÂLetÃÂs not give in to Washington and its stagnated ways. LetÃÂs follow the lead of Presidents Reagan and Bush and help President Trump begin his administration with tax cuts for everyone and less money in Washington,ÃÂ Paul wrote in an op-ed for Breitbart.

ÃÂWe have tried it before,ÃÂ Paul wrote. ÃÂIn fact, the most successful Republican presidents (and a few Democrats) led off their agendas with tax cuts to send money back and to try to get government to live with a little less.ÃÂ 

Indeed, there have been two men who have shown how well tax cuts can play a role in stimulating our economy. These men were Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy.

When we elected the youthful Kennedy to become our 35th president, he had little economic experience, and the nation was still in the doldrums of a recession in 1958 that rivaled the one of 2008. He set out to determine how to get the country back on track.

As Lawrence Kudlow and Brian Domitrovic wrote in Time, in KennedyÃÂs first year in office, he at first tried the typical Democrat approach and instilled a number of spending approaches. However, growth was only at a stagnant 2.7 percent. He then had a change of heart and decided to push through a generous tax cut of 30 percent. 

Although Kennedy never saw it to fruition before he was assassinated, LBJ decided to push it through as a memorial to the fallen leader. The tax cut became law in 1964, and it started an uninterrupted run of eight years of consistent economic growth of at least five percent annually.

One of KennedyÃÂs other successors was a man named Ronald Reagan, who was intrigued by the Kennedy model of tax cuts. He devised his own plan, and it passed the Senate by a 97-3 vote in 1986. The nation enjoyed a long-term growth rate of roughly four percent per year.

In 2016, the economy is not completely bleak, but it could be much better. The nation has had stagnant growth for much of the last two presidentsÃÂ terms, but as Rand Paul noted, even when George W. Bush attempted a modest tax cut, it gave the nation a boost for a period of time.

In standing with Donald TrumpÃÂs ambitious tax cut plans, Rand Paul is staying true to himself and to this model. Trump has proven so far that he is a person of his word, and his proposed tax cuts would give this country the prosperity it so richly deserves.

If Trump doesnÃÂt follow through and it is just a ÃÂread my lipsÃÂ moment, he will probably be a one-term president. He has PaulÃÂs support, so hopefully we can get America back on the right path to making it, once more, ÃÂGreat Again.ÃÂ"	1
303	"A quiet burst of activity from the Sanders campaign seems to all but guarantee that Sanders will run as an independent this election cycle. All across the country SandersÃÂ core infrastructure of volunteers and paid staff are mobilizing to collect signatures and perform necessary paperwork to get him on the general election ballots in the states.

Officials highly placed within the Sanders campaign remain evasive and deny that the senator plans, at this time, to run as an independent. Sanders campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, has stated time and time again that they intend to go all the way to the convention and make the case that Sanders should be the Democratic nominee for the 2016 general election. But the Sanders campaign is actively engaging in activities, within the states, that have no other purpose besides putting Sanders in the position of being able to run as an independent candidate against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

If Sanders were to run in the general election, as the evidence of his campaignÃÂs actions point to, it could disastrously impact Democratic frontrunner Hillary ClintonÃÂs ability to win against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. With present polling showing Clinton ahead of Trump in the general election by only six points, even a small split of democratic/democratic leaning independent voters would virtually guarantee a Trump victory and presidency. And with divisiveness and disunity within the Democratic party over policy direction and candidate choice at an all time high, polling experts say Sanders could syphon off as much as 20% of the democratic vote in a 3 candidate general election.

Many of Sanders supporters have been openly and vocally calling for the senator to run as an independent if he fails to secure the Democratic nomination. Citing unfair favouritism toward Clinton by the DNC under Debbie Wasserman Schultz, highly suspicious deviations between primary exit polling and election results, Sanders supporters have made the argument that the systematic corruption within the Democratic party will not allow progressive ideas and platforms to flourish if the party elite believe they can act with impunity and still count on the vote of progressives. It has been reported that Sanders is privately supportive of this type of analysis, and his coming independent candidacy will be engineered to force the party to the left, going forward, if they wish to compete against Republicans on a national level.

Sources within the Sanders campaign, speaking on conditions of anonymity, say that Sanders has indeed been seriously considering an independent run, and wishes to ensure the option is available to him by performing the necessary work now. If Sanders were to wait until after the convention to lay the legal foundation for an independent run it would be too late. It is this fact that explains the Sanders campaignÃÂs actions toward inclusion on state ballots as an independent at this time."	1
304	"President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that ÃÂnobody really knowsÃÂ whether climate change is real and that he is ÃÂstudyingÃÂ whether the United States should withdraw from the global warming agreement struck in Paris a year ago.

In an interview with ÃÂFox News SundayÃÂ host Chris Wallace, Trump said heÃÂs ÃÂvery open-mindedÃÂ on whether climate change is underway but has serious concerns about how President ObamaÃÂs efforts to cut carbon emissions have undercut AmericaÃÂs global competitiveness.

ÃÂIÃÂm still open-minded. Nobody really knows,ÃÂ Trump said. ÃÂLook, IÃÂm somebody that gets it, and nobody really knows. ItÃÂs not something thatÃÂs so hard and fast. I do know this: Other countries are eating our lunch.ÃÂ

There is a broad scientific consensus that human activity ÃÂ including the burning of fossil fuels for transportation, heating and industrial manufacturing ÃÂ is driving recent climate change. In its most recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that it is ÃÂextremely likelyÃÂ that, since the 1950s, humans and their greenhouse gas emissions have been the ÃÂdominant causeÃÂ of the planetÃÂs warming trend. The top 10 hottest years on record have all been since 1998, and 2016 is expected to be the hottest year since formal record-keeping began in 1880.

But itÃÂs not the first time that Trump has disregarded that established scientific view.

During the presidential campaign, Trump referred to climate change as a ÃÂhoaxÃÂ perpetrated by the Chinese, a comment he later described as a joke. But during a town hall in New Hampshire, he also mocked the idea of global warming. At that event, Meghan Andrade, a volunteer for the League of Conservation Voters, asked Trump what he would do to address the issue, to which he replied: ÃÂLet me ask you this ÃÂ take it easy, fellas ÃÂ how many people here believe in global warming? Do you believe in global warming?ÃÂ

After asking three times ÃÂWho believes in global warming?ÃÂ and soliciting a show of hands, Trump concluded that ÃÂnobodyÃÂ believed climate change was underway except for Andrade.

During SundayÃÂs interview with Wallace, Trump said he needed to balance any environmental regulation against the fact that manufacturers and other businesses in China and elsewhere are able to operate without the kind of restrictions faced by their U.S. competitors.

ÃÂIf you look at what ÃÂ I could name country after country. You look at whatÃÂs happening in Mexico, where our people are just ÃÂ plants are being built, and they donÃÂt wait 10 years to get an approval to build a plant, okay?ÃÂ he said. ÃÂThey build it like the following day or the following week. We canÃÂt let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs.ÃÂ

The U.S. has outpaced the rest of the developed world in terms of growth since the 2008 recession, though developing countries such as China boast higher growth rates. Typically, economists compare the U.S. against other industrialized nations since developing countries typically grow faster than their developed counterparts.

The New York businessman made the same critique of the Environmental Protection Agency, to which he has nominated Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt ÃÂ a climate change skeptic ÃÂ as the head. Wallace asked whether he was ÃÂgoing to take a wrecking ball to the Obama legacy,ÃÂ to which Trump replied, ÃÂNo. No. No. I donÃÂt want to do that at all.  I just want whatÃÂs right.ÃÂ

ÃÂEPA, you canÃÂt get things approved. I mean, people are waiting in line for 15 years before they get rejected, okay? ÃÂ he said. ÃÂThatÃÂs why people donÃÂt want to invest in this country.ÃÂ

It is unclear which permit application Trump was referring to, but he has repeatedly criticized EPA rules. And though he has given mixed signals on whether he would back out of the United StatesÃÂ voluntary commitments under the Paris climate agreement, it would take several years for the next administration to withdraw now that the agreement has entered into force.


Last week TrumpÃÂs transition team for the Energy Department asked officials there to identify which employees have participated in international climate negotiations or worked on domestic efforts to cut greenhouse gases, such as calculating the social cost of carbon. Several scientists, federal union officials and public watchdog groups have expressed concern that these individuals could be targeted for retaliation once Trump takes office.

305	"As a retired military officer, I watched last nightÃÂs Republican debate from Detroit (transcript here) with a special focus on which candidate is qualified to lead the military as commander-in-chief.  I knew, of course, that Donald Trump had promised in the past to use torture against AmericaÃÂs enemies (last night, he called them ÃÂanimalsÃÂ), that he would pursue and kill not only terrorists but their families (apparently because the families always know, according to Trump, what their father/brother/sister is up to, as if there are no secrets in families).  Trump, in short, is an Old Testament ÃÂeye for an eyeÃÂ man: if they behead us, weÃÂll torture and kill them, end of story.

But Trump was put on the spot when he was asked what he would do if the U.S. military failed to carry out his unlawful orders. Instead of saying he wouldnÃÂt issue unlawful orders, that he would support and defend the U.S. Constitution, which as president would be his sworn duty to uphold, Trump boasted that the military would follow his orders no matter what.

America: those are the words of a dictator.

HereÃÂs what was said:

BAIER: Mr. Trump, just yesterday, almost 100 foreign policy experts signed on to an open letter refusing to support you, saying your embracing expansive use of torture is inexcusable. General Michael Hayden, former CIA director, NSA director, and other experts have said that when you asked the U.S. military to carry out some of your campaign promises, specifically targeting terroristsÃÂ families, and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding, the military will refuse because theyÃÂve been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders.

So what would you do, as commander-in-chief, if the U.S. military refused to carry out those orders?

TRUMP: They wonÃÂt refuse. TheyÃÂre not going to refuse me. Believe me.

BAIER: But theyÃÂre illegal.

TRUMP: Let me just tell you, you look at the Middle East. TheyÃÂre chopping off heads. TheyÃÂre chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way. TheyÃÂre drowning people in steel cages. And he ÃÂ now weÃÂre talking about waterboarding.

This really started with Ted, a question was asked of Ted last ÃÂ two debates ago about waterboarding. And Ted was, you know, having a hard time with that question, to be totally honest with you. They then came to me, what do you think of waterboarding? I said itÃÂs fine. And if we want to go stronger, IÃÂd go stronger, too, because, frankly...

(APPLAUSE)

... thatÃÂs the way I feel. Can you imagine ÃÂ can you imagine these people, these animals over in the Middle East, that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that weÃÂre having a hard problem with waterboarding? We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding. ThatÃÂs my opinion.

BAIER: But targeting terroristsÃÂ families?

(APPLAUSE)

TRUMP: And ÃÂ and ÃÂ and ÃÂ IÃÂm a leader. IÃÂm a leader. IÃÂve always been a leader. IÃÂve never had any problem leading people. If I say do it, theyÃÂre going to do it. ThatÃÂs what leadership is all about.

Our military does not follow blindly orders issued by ÃÂThe Leader.ÃÂ Our military swears an oath to the Constitution.  We swear to uphold the law of the land.  We donÃÂt swear allegiance to a single man (or woman) as president.

TrumpÃÂs performance last night reminded me of Richard NixonÃÂs infamous answer to David Frost about Watergate: ÃÂWhen the president does it, that means itÃÂs not illegal.ÃÂ No, no, a thousand times no.  The president has to obey the law of the land, just as everyone else has to.  No person is above the law, an American ideal that Trump seems neither to understand nor to embrace.

And that disqualifies him to be president and commander-in-chief."	0
306	"Earlier tonight, Ted Cruz announced he was getting out of the race for the Republican Nomination. Cruz was defeated by Donald Trump through a particularly large margin. To this point, Ted Cruz had served as Donald TrumpÃÂs strictest competitor in the often contentious race.

Following the loss, Donald Trump commended Cruz for serving as his greatest competitor and said he was a smart guy. Immediately after Ted Cruz announced he was no longer running for president, he swiftly excited the facility where his press conference was held.

Approximately one hour after leaving the campaign site, Ted Cruz was spotted in a nearby store purchasing trash bags, bleach, and a shovel ÃÂ fueling rampant speculation that he was none other than the Zodiac Killer getting back to his old ways.

While making the purchase, Cruz could be seen pacing back in forth mumbling the lyrics to ÃÂMad WorldÃÂ by Gary Jules underneath his breath.

The Ted Cruz campaign has vehemently denied up to this point that Cruz could be the elusive Zodiac Killer but images released online seem to paint a very different picture.

When asked by the clerk what he was using the items for, Cruz said he was ÃÂgetting back to workÃÂ and handed him a card with a mysterious symbol."	1
307	"Charleston, SC ÃÂ Just one day after the Democratic Primary, legendary actor, comedian, and writer, Bill Murray, brought his newly announced Presidential campaign to Charleston, South Carolina, speaking to an estimated crowd of over 100,000 cheering fans and supporters.

ÃÂHello South Carolina! Are you ready to get weird or what?ÃÂ Murray said to the roaring crowd.

MurrayÃÂs speech, which lasted a little more than an hour, touched on many issues from his campaign, including increased wages, health care, the cost of higher education and human rights in general. The rally also included wine tasting and stages where the people in attendance were allowed to sing karaoke.

ÃÂI saw the Republican debate the other night and it made me sick to my stomach,ÃÂ Murray told the crowd. ÃÂHere are grown men, candidates running for President of the United States, and theyÃÂre acting like 4-year-olds. TheyÃÂre up there on stage, broadcasted to the entire world, calling each other names, interrupting each other, making complete fools of themselves and I just thought to myself; I think the American people deserve better than this. I know we deserve better than this because we are better than this.ÃÂ

Political analyst, Paul Horner, told ABC News he has taken an extreme interest in what Murray is doing since he announced his run for President just a little more than a week ago.



ÃÂI donÃÂt know if Bill Murray is really running for President or if heÃÂs just having some fun, but the man is making some excellent points out there. HeÃÂs getting people to think about the state their country is in right now and making a lot of people happy while doing it. I applaud Mr. Murray for what heÃÂs doing.ÃÂ

ÃÂI pretty much donÃÂt like any of the candidates that are running for President right now,ÃÂ Murray told the crowd, ÃÂI think Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy, but the rest of emÃÂ, are pretty much complete pond scum in my opinion.ÃÂ Murray continued, ÃÂIÃÂm always traveling around the world, but IÃÂm proud to call America, the good oleÃÂ U.S. of A, my home. I think thereÃÂs a lot of great people here, a lot of potential, but thereÃÂs also a lot of confusion and hate right now. People donÃÂt know what to make of these Hitler wanna-beÃÂs like Donald Trump, and the Ted CruzÃÂs, who want to start World War III. They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has, and because of that, you see them leading in the polls. And itÃÂs sad that people go along with it, and canÃÂt see it for what it really is.ÃÂ

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President.

ÃÂWe need a new face in Washington. Someone who has no political ties or agenda and canÃÂt be bought,ÃÂ Bradley said. ÃÂI actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was amazing; heÃÂs such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place.ÃÂ

Murray finished the rally by saying, ÃÂIÃÂm no hero, I just want to help out, and I hope you all choose to stand behind me, or beside me, or wherever is comfortable for you, but just as long as itÃÂs with me. Look, we donÃÂt need to make America great again, because it already is; we all just need to try a little bit harder and have more love in our hearts for our fellow man. I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then thatÃÂs sort of how youÃÂre supposed to live. Lets all help each other make this the best life experience possible!ÃÂ

Murray still has yet to announce if he will be running as an Republican, Democrat or Independent.

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

ÃÂThis type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money,ÃÂ Mikkelson said. ÃÂThe secret behind a good Snopes article is a formula that we have used since day one, itÃÂs actually quite simple. First, we start with the same cookie-cutter outline we use for every site that we debunk. Next, we copy and paste parts of the original article into ours. After that, one of our ÃÂwritersÃÂ will type one or two sentences that talk about the content we just copy and pasted. And now, last but not least, we slap a title on there similar to the articleÃÂs headline that weÃÂre debunking. This way it will show up at the top of Google for anyone searching for that story, and thatÃÂs it! Then we just sit back and let the money roll in. We are the absolute definition of clickbait! IÃÂll tell what, if it wasnÃÂt for great writers like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, putting out the stories that he does, my children wouldnÃÂt have been able to go to college.ÃÂ Holding back tears, Mikkelson finishes by saying, ÃÂThough we are currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a ÃÂfake news siteÃÂ, so lets just hope Paul Horner writes another story soon.ÃÂ

MurrayÃÂs campaign team told reporters their next stop is the Arizona State Capitol on March 2nd and then the Tempe Improv later that night. It is rumored Murray will be at the Improv meeting with locals and telling a few jokes. Tickets to that show are only $10."	1
308	"CARSON CITY, Nv. ÃÂ A robocall dialed out to hundreds of thousands of conservative voters on Tuesday warned of an imminent missile strike on several cities in Nevada, including the state capital, Carson City. The call prompted a mass evacuation of potential Republican supporters from the state and has been blamed for at least twenty-five deaths.

Just hours before the start of NevadaÃÂs Republican caucus, potential voters received a forty-five second prerecorded phone call informing them that New York, Washington, and Los Angeles had just been obliterated by ballistic missiles. ÃÂEvacuation orders have been issued for your state,ÃÂ the call calmly explained. ÃÂYou are to immediately report to your precinctÃÂs designated polling center for further instructions.ÃÂ

The vast majority of those who received Tuesday afternoonÃÂs robocall -perhaps out of fear of nuclear annihilation- didnÃÂt stay on the line long enough to find out that the call had been paid for by Ted Cruz for President and, according to the Texas senatorÃÂs campaign manager, was meant to ÃÂmerely warn voters of the dangers of a Trump presidency.ÃÂ

In an interview with MSNBCÃÂs Chuck Todd, Senator Cruz said that such calls are common during primary season and accused his fellow candidates of forming a behind-the-scenes alliance in order to conduct a ÃÂdishonest and misleading smear campaignÃÂ against him. The senator expressed sadness over the tragic loss of at least two-dozen potential voters who perished trying to flee a fictitious Nevadan Hiroshima but blamed his rivals for taking parts of the call out of context in order to discredit him ÃÂat the expense of the good people of Nevada.ÃÂ

Meanwhile, statements released by the Trump and Rubio camps called for a complete redo of the Nevada caucus. While Senator Rubio accused Cruz of ÃÂdenying people their constitutional rights;ÃÂ Donald Trump complained that CruzÃÂs ÃÂdeceptive tacticsÃÂ had likely cost him ÃÂmillionsÃÂ of votes.

The Nevada caucus marks the final GOP primary leading up to Super Tuesday on March 1st."	1
309	"It seems weÃÂre entering another of those stupid seasons humans impose on themselves at fairly regular intervals.

My background is archaeology, so also history and anthropology. It leads me to look at big historical patterns. My theory is that most peoplesÃÂ perspective of history is limited to the experience communicated by their parents and grandparents, so 50-100 years. To go beyond that you have to read, study and learn to untangle the propaganda that is inevitable in all telling of history. In a nutshell, at university I would fail a paper if I didnÃÂt compare at least two, if not three opposing views on a topic. Taking one telling of events as gospel doesnÃÂt wash in the comparative analytical method of research that forms the core of British academia. (I canÃÂt speak for other systems, but theyÃÂre definitely not all alike in this way.)

So zooming out, we humans have a habit of going into phases of mass destruction, generally self-imposed to some extent or another. This handy list shows all the wars over time. Wars are actually the norm for humans, but every now and then something big comes along. I am interested in the Black Death, which devastated Europe. The opening of BoccaccioÃÂs Decameron describes Florence in the grips of the Plague. It is as beyond imagination as the Somme, Hiroshima or the Holocaust. I mean, you quite literally canÃÂt put yourself there and imagine what it was like. For those in the midst of the Plague, it must have felt like the end of the world.

[Trump is] a charismatic narcissist who feeds on the crowd to become ever stronger, creating a cult around himself.
But a defining feature of humans is their resilience. To us now, it seems obvious that we survived the Plague, but to people at the time it must have seemed incredible that their society continued afterwards. Indeed, many takes on the effects of the Black Death are that it had a positive impact in the long term. Well summed up here:

By targeting frail people of all ages, and killing them by the hundreds of thousands within an extremely short period of time, the Black Death might have represented a strong force of natural selection and removed the weakest individuals on a very broad scale within Europe,ÃÂ ...In addition, the Black Death significantly changed the social structure of some European regions. Tragic depopulation created the shortage of working people. This shortage caused wages to rise. Products prices fell too. Consequently, standards of living increased. For instance, people started to consume more food of higher quality.

But for the people living through it, as with the World Wars, Soviet Famines, Holocaust, it must have felt inconceivable that humans could rise up from it. The collapse of the Roman Empire, Black Death, Spanish Inquisition, Thirty Years War, War of the Roses, English Civil War... itÃÂs a long list. Events of massive destruction from which humanity recovered and move on, often in better shape.

At a local level in time, people think things are fine ÃÂ then things rapidly spiral out of control until they become unstoppable, and we wreak massive destruction on ourselves. For the people living in the midst of this, it is hard to see happening and hard to understand. To historians later, it all makes sense and we see clearly how one thing led to another. During the Centenary of the Battle of the Somme I was struck that it was a direct outcome of the assassination of an Austrian Arch Duke in Bosnia. I very much doubt anyone at the time thought the killing of a minor European royal would lead to the death of 17 million people.

My point is that this is a cycle. It happens again and again, but as most people only have a 50-100 year historical perspective they donÃÂt see that itÃÂs happening again. As the events that led to the First World War unfolded, there were a few brilliant minds who started to warn that something big was wrong, that the web of treaties across Europe could lead to a war, but they were dismissed as hysterical, mad, or fools, as is always the way, and as people who worry about Putin, Brexit and Trump are dismissed now.

A little thing leads to an unstoppable destruction that could have been prevented if youÃÂd listened and thought a bit.
Then after the War to end all Wars, we went and had another one. Again, for a historian it was quite predictable. Lead people to feel they have lost control of their country and destiny, people look for scapegoats, a charismatic leader captures the popular mood, and singles out that scapegoat. He talks in rhetoric that has no detail, and drums up anger and hatred. Soon the masses start to move as one, without any logic driving their actions, and the whole becomes unstoppable.

That was Hitler, but it was also Mussolini, Stalin, Putin, Mugabe and so many more. Mugabe is a very good case in point. He whipped up national anger and hatred towards the land owning white minority (who happened to know how to run farms), and seized their land to redistribute to the people, in a great populist move which in the end unravelled the economy and farming industry and left the people in possession of land, but starving. See also the famines created by the Soviet Union, and the one caused by the Chinese Communists last century in which 20-40 million people died. It seems inconceivable that people could create a situation in which tens of millions of people die without reason, but we do it again and again.

But at the time people donÃÂt realize theyÃÂre embarking on a route that will lead to a destruction period. They think theyÃÂre right, theyÃÂre cheered on by jeering angry mobs, their critics are mocked. This cycle, the one we saw for example from the Treaty of Versaille, to the rise of Hitler, to the Second World War, appears to be happening again. But as with before, most people cannot see it because:

1. They are only looking at the present, not the past or future

2. They are only looking immediately around them, not at how events connect globally

3. Most people donÃÂt read, think, challenge or hear opposing views

Trump is doing this in America. Those of us with some oversight from history can see it happening. Read this brilliant, long essay in the New York magazine to understand how Plato described all this, and it is happening just as he predicted. Trump says he will Make America Great Again, when in fact America is currently great, according to pretty well any statistics. He is using passion, anger and rhetoric in the same way all his predecessors did ÃÂ a charismatic narcissist who feeds on the crowd to become ever stronger, creating a cult around himself. You can blame society, politicians, the media, for America getting to the point that itÃÂs ready for Trump, but the bigger historical picture is that history generally plays out the same way each time someone like him becomes the boss.

On a wider stage, zoom out some more, Russia is a dictatorship with a charismatic leader using fear and passion to establish a cult around himself. Turkey is now there too. Hungary, Poland, Slovakia are heading that way, and across Europe more Trumps and Putins are waiting in the wings, in fact funded by Putin, waiting for the popular tide to turn their way.

We should be asking ourselves what our Archduke Ferdinand moment will be. How will an apparently small event trigger another period of massive destruction. We see Brexit, Trump, Putin in isolation. The world does not work that way? ÃÂ? all things are connected and affecting each other. I have pro-Brexit friends who say, ÃÂOh, youÃÂre going to blame that on Brexit too??ÃÂ But they donÃÂt realize that actually, yes, historians will trace neat lines from apparently unrelated events back to major political and social shifts like Brexit.

We are entering a bad phase. It will be unpleasant for those living through it, maybe even will unravel into being hellish and beyond imagination.
Brexit ÃÂ a group of angry people winning a fight ÃÂ easily inspires other groups of angry people to start a similar fight, empowered with the idea that they may win. That alone can trigger chain reactions. A nuclear explosion is not caused by one atom splitting, but by the impact of the first atom that splits causing multiple other atoms near it to split, and they in turn causing multiple atoms to split. The exponential increase in atoms splitting, and their combined energy is the bomb. That is how World War One started and, ironically how World War Two ended.
An example of how Brexit could lead to a nuclear war could be this:

Brexit in the UK causes Italy or France to have a similar referendum. Le Pen wins an election in France. Europe now has a fractured EU. The EU, for all its many awful faults, has prevented a war in Europe for longer than ever before. The EU is also a major force in suppressing PutinÃÂs military ambitions. European sanctions on Russia really hit the economy, and helped temper RussiaÃÂs attacks on Ukraine (there is a reason bad guys always want a weaker European Union). Trump wins in the US. Trump becomes isolationist, which weakens NATO. He has already said he would not automatically honor NATO commitments in the face of a Russian attack on the Baltics.

With a fractured EU, and weakened NATO, Putin, facing an ongoing economic and social crisis in Russia, needs another foreign distraction around which to rally his people. He funds far right anti-EU activists in Latvia, who then create a reason for an uprising of the Russian Latvians in the East of the country (the EU border with Russia). Russia sends ÃÂpeace keeping forcesÃÂ and ÃÂaid lorriesÃÂ into Latvia, as it did in Georgia, and in Ukraine. He cedes Eastern Latvia as he did Eastern Ukraine (Crimea has the same population as Latvia, by the way).

A divided Europe, with the leaders of France, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and others now pro-Russia, anti-EU, and funded by Putin, overrule calls for sanctions or a military response. NATO is slow to respond: Trump does not want America to be involved, and a large part of Europe is indifferent or blocking any action. Russia, seeing no real resistance to their actions, move further into Latvia, and then into Eastern Estonia and Lithuania. The Baltic States declare war on Russia and start to retaliate, as they have now been invaded so have no choice. Half of Europe sides with them, a few countries remain neutral, and a few side with Russia. Where does Turkey stand on this? How does ISIS respond to a new war in Europe? Who uses a nuclear weapon first?

This is just one Arch Duke Ferdinand scenario. The number of possible scenarios are infinite due to the massive complexity of the many moving parts. And of course many of them lead to nothing happening. But based on history we are due another period of destruction, and based on history all the indicators are that we are entering one.

It will come in ways we canÃÂt see coming, and will spin out of control so fast people wonÃÂt be able to stop it. Historians will look back and make sense of it all and wonder how we could all have been so naÃÂ¯ve. How could I sit in a nice cafÃÂ© in London, writing this, without wanting to run away. How could people read it and make sarcastic and dismissive comments about how pro-Remain people should stop whining, and how we shouldnÃÂt blame everything on Brexit. Others will read this and sneer at me for saying America is in great shape, that Trump is a possible future Hitler (and yes, GodwinÃÂs Law. But my comparison is to another narcissistic, charismatic leader fanning flames of hatred until things spiral out of control). ItÃÂs easy to jump to conclusions that oppose pessimistic predictions based on the weight of history and learning. Trump won against the other Republicans in debates by countering their claims by calling them names and dismissing them. ItÃÂs an easy route but the wrong one.

Ignoring and mocking the experts, as people are doing around Brexit and TrumpÃÂs campaign, is no different to ignoring a doctor who tells you to stop smoking, and then finding later youÃÂve developed incurable cancer. A little thing leads to an unstoppable destruction that could have been prevented if youÃÂd listened and thought a bit. But people smoke, and people die from it. That is the way of the human.

We need to find a way to bridge from our closed groups to other closed groups, try to cross the ever widening social divides.
So I feel itÃÂs all inevitable. I donÃÂt know what it will be, but we are entering a bad phase. It will be unpleasant for those living through it, maybe even will unravel into being hellish and beyond imagination. Humans will come out the other side, recover and move on. The human race will be fine, changed, maybe better. But for those at the sharp end ÃÂ for the thousands of Turkish teachers who just got fired, for the Turkish journalists and lawyers in prison, for the Russian dissidents in gulags, for people lying wounded in French hospitals after terrorist attacks, for those yet to fall, this will be their Somme.

What can we do? Well, again, looking back, probably not much. The liberal intellectuals are always in the minority. See Clay ShirkyÃÂs Twitter Storm on this point. The people who see that open societies, being nice to other people, not being racist, not fighting wars, is a better way to live, they generally end up losing these fights. They donÃÂt fight dirty. They are terrible at appealing to the populace. They are less violent, so end up in prisons, camps, and graves. We need to beware not to become divided (see: Labour party), we need to avoid getting lost in arguing through facts and logic, and counter the populist messages of passion and anger with our own similar messages. We need to understand and use social media.

We need to harness a different fear. Fear of another World War nearly stopped World War 2, but didnÃÂt. We need to avoid our own echo chambers. Trump and Putin supporters donÃÂt read the Guardian, so writing there is just reassuring our friends. We need to find a way to bridge from our closed groups to other closed groups, try to cross the ever widening social divides.

(Perhaps IÃÂm just writing this so I can be remembered by history as one of the people who saw it coming.)"	0
310	"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) ÃÂ U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation. The Senator called this ÃÂThe single most important issue facing the country todayÃÂ and that without ÃÂswift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self-satisfactionÃÂ.



ÃÂSelf-love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because youÃÂve died from auto-erotic asphyxiation. IÃÂm not saying that we should lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key; what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society. That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the DevilÃÂs playground for good,ÃÂ Cruz said. ÃÂIÃÂm asking Mr. Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem, and commit to finding real solutions. If he does that, I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November. Should Mr. Trump decline, I think itÃÂs safe to say that all options, including a third party run, are out on the table.ÃÂ

Donald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea, though he refused to take a clear stand on the issue.

ÃÂLook, do I think Ted Cruz is right about this? Maybe he is, maybe he isnÃÂt. To be honest, I donÃÂt know a lot about this subject matter. I donÃÂt need to. I have a wife that takes care of this for me, and sheÃÂs a beautiful wife, the best wife, the greatest wife. My people are going to take a hard look into this matter and find a great answer for it, the best answer there is. I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz, and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for non-reproductive purposes illegal.ÃÂ

This is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self-stimulation. As solicitor general of Texas in 2007 he fought to uphold the stateÃÂs ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no ÃÂRight to stimulate oneÃÂs genitals.ÃÂ Cruz eventually lost this battle, but the story re-surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention, prompting CruzÃÂs former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that CruzÃÂs stance against stimulating oneÃÂs own genitals was ÃÂA new belief of hisÃÂ, implying that much of CruzÃÂs time in college was, in fact, spent stimulating his own genitals. Another one of CruzÃÂs former college roommates, Matt Daemon, has recently come forward to corroborate MazinÃÂs story.

ÃÂAll Ted Cruz did was take care of little Ted Cruz back then, which is fine I guess, but he was always real creepy about doing it. Honestly, I lost track of the number of times I came home to find him laying on the couch naked, lotion and Kleenex next to him, watching re-runs of Walker Texas Ranger. He wouldnÃÂt even try and cover up when I caught him, he would just stare at me in the eyes and continue until I left the room. ItÃÂs absolutely hilarious about the tough stance on touching oneÃÂs self that Ted has taken in this country. I truly believe he may have pulled on it one too many times and it broke or something and now feels that if he canÃÂt do it anymore, then no one can.ÃÂ



Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by the Republican party.

ÃÂIt is absolutely disgusting that in this day in age, a creepy weirdo like Ted Cruz was almost elected as the GOP nomination for President,ÃÂ Bradley said. ÃÂWith all the real problems in this country like starvation, so many people out of work and families living on the street, Cruz is focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime.ÃÂ Bradley continued, ÃÂAlso, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps.ÃÂ

Cruz, however, remains undeterred by his detractors. ÃÂWhen you play with your Devil stick or ring the DevilÃÂs doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep, and they are weeping for this country 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. America needs strong moral leadership, and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task. The fate of our great nation is in his hands; hopefully, theyÃÂre big enough to handle it.ÃÂ

Most pundits expect Trump to answer CruzÃÂs call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter. A recent poll by the New York Times found that 43% of likely Trump voters support a ban on self-stimulation due to moral and religious concerns. Another 46% would be okay with a ban, saying that they, like Trump, have far too many potential suitors, and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges. Only 11% of Trump supporters are against a ban.

RNC political strategist, 37-year-old Paul Horner, calls the move a ÃÂno-brainerÃÂ and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz.

ÃÂConservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue. If Donald does not side with the Senator, he risks alienating the partyÃÂs Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton. Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one, no matter how creepy, insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is.ÃÂ

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

ÃÂYou have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy,ÃÂ Mikkleson said. ÃÂWe claim ÃÂto provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as wellÃÂ, but thatÃÂs just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thatÃÂs it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and IÃÂm only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.ÃÂ Mikkelson continues, ÃÂIt is common for us to rewrite a story weÃÂre debunking if we donÃÂt like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a personÃÂs name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,ÃÂ Mikkelson laughs. ÃÂAnd lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as ÃÂa clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false ÃÂnewsÃÂ storiesÃÂ. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We donÃÂt list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims; ItÃÂs just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, IÃÂd say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.ÃÂ

311	"With Democrats unable to stop President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks on their own, they're hoping that increased scrutiny on his nominees will do it for them.

As the minority party in the Senate with little real recourse at their disposal, uncovering something disqualifying may be Democrats' last best hope to block some Trump selections that they view as unacceptable and outside the political mainstream.

Even if they don't have the votes to shoot down any nominees, Democratic senators will grill them in committee hearings. They can slow the confirmation process with procedural moves or try to shame them ÃÂ all in the service of trying to peel off the three Republican votes they would need to kill a nomination or force the Trump White House to withdraw the pick.

Not all of Trump's picks will face such aggressive scrutiny, which Democrats insist is not merely reflexive partisan opposition. Retired Gen. James Mattis is expected to sail through his confirmation to be defense secretary, even though his recent tenure in the active-duty military means he'll need a special waiver that requires 60 votes in the Senate.

But some of Trump's picks, Democrats say, represent existential threats to the basic mission of the departments they've been tapped to lead, and so the nominees have no business in those jobs.

There's Trump's reported pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, chief executive of oil giant ExxonMobil, who has warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. There's Trump's pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who has made a name for himself by suing the agency. There's Andy Puzder, Trump's choice for the Labor Department, a fast food executive who wants to replace workers with robots.

There's Betsy DeVos, a school choice advocate seen as hostile to public education, whom Trump wants to put in charge of the Education Department. And there's attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions, an anti-immigration hard-liner whom the Senate once rejected for a federal judgeship over past racially insensitive comments.


Democratic congressional aides and outside groups will spend the coming weeks poring over the financial statements, personal histories and public utterances of Trump's most polarizing Cabinet selections, hoping to find information that could turn them into the next Tom Daschle or Zoe Baird ÃÂ Barack Obama and Bill Clinton Cabinet nominees who were forced to withdraw after damaging issues came to light during the confirmation process.

And Democrats have reason to believe Trump's nominees provide an especially rich vein for digging, because according to reports, few have been subjected to a traditionally thorough vetting process by his transition team. Many are wealthy business executives with sprawling financial entanglements and no political experience or the scrutiny that comes with it.

""What's unusual about Trump's Cabinet picks is that so few of them come from politics, which means that they're going to have a harder time than usual going through the traditional vet and public evaluation,"" said Simon Rosenberg, president of the Democratic think tank NDN. ""Some of them are going to crash. Some of them aren't going to make it because of things that are going to come up in their background.""

Democrats will have to pick their battles, and priorities will likely be decided based not only by how threatening they find Trump's nominees, but how vulnerable the nominees are after some digging.

Related: Donald Trump Builds Cabinet with Old Friends and Some Rivals

""Much of it depends on what's uncovered in the vetting process,"" said Jim Manley, a former aide to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ""As Senator Daschle found out, one little thing can trip you up.""

Daschle was nominated to head the Department of Health and Human Services in 2009 but removed his name after controversy over his taxes emerged.

Old domestic abuse allegations related to a messy divorce have already surfaced with Puzder. But complicated financial issues are more likely to trip up Trump's nominees than personal indiscretions, especially given the number of super-wealthy candidates Trump has chosen.

""The Senate Finance Committee has developed a reputation as somewhat of a killing field for nominees in recent years,"" Manley said. ""They've developed the experience to really pick apart the financials.""

And Trump's team may be flying blind to some extent. His transition team has reportedly forgone the rigorous vetting process traditionally performed on potential nominees before they are announced publicly, leaving his picks potentially vulnerable to surprises.

Selecting Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-kansas, as CIA director was ""pretty simple,"" said Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, who is working on Trump's transition team.

""They asked me who would be the person for the agency, and I said without a doubt that Pompeo would be a great pick,"" Nunes told Politico.

Dan Kanninen, a former Obama White House official who helped choose candidates for jobs in the Environmental Protection Agency, said it takes weeks or months for even the best transition teams to properly vet candidates.

""With Trump, none of that, as far as we can tell, happened before the election. And now, if it is happening at all, it's happening in a matter of days based on the gut on the president-elect,"" he said. ""It would not surprise me at all, given how little we know ÃÂ and frankly how little the Trump team knows ÃÂ if something came up with of a magnitude that might kill some of their nominations.""

Even under the best of circumstances, things get missed. Clinton rescinded Baird's nomination to be attorney general because it was discovered that she had hired an undocumented immigrant as a nanny.

The Senate confirmation process can be brutal even for squeaky clean candidates who have spent their whole careers in government. A ""Survivor's Guide for Presidential Nominees"" prepared by the National Academy of Public Administration, a congressionally chartered non-profit, stretches over 71 pages and warns, ""If you are not nervous going into your confirmation hearing, you should be.""

 Nov. 24: Trump Scrutinized Over Cabinet Picks, Intelligence Briefings 2:38
It may be especially bumpy for Trump's nominees from the private sector, who are not accustomed to government processes and who have not already gone through the kind of public and legal scrutiny politicians and government officials are used to.

Three years ago, facing Republican obstruction, Senate Democrats decided to kill the filibuster for executive branch appointments, which means they now cannot force Republicans to find the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. Republicans need only 51 votes in the Senate to confirm Trump's Cabinet picks.

Democrats would need three Republicans to join them to shoot down any of Trump's nominees, and so far none have expressed interest in taking up the cause.

Some Democrats, unsurprisingly, are having buyer's remorse about the filibuster change, including Reid's successor as Democratic Leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York.

""I wanted 60 for Supreme Court and Cabinet, but I didn't prevail,"" Schumer told The Washington Post.

Still, he vowed opposition to some nominees, however possible. ""If it's somebody who is out of the mainstream,"" Schumer said, ""we'll fight tooth and nail and use every tool we have.""

The Senate has traditionally deferred to new presidents' wishes in filling out their Cabinets, approving many nominees without bothering to even take formal votes.

Recent incoming presidents have had to withdraw only one or two Cabinet picks, if any at all, and the Senate has voted to outright reject just three nominees in the past 100 years, according to the Senate historian.

But Democrats are in no mood to be deferential to Trump after Republicans, in their view, broke with tradition by obstructing Obama Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland for nine months and fought the confirmation of his second attorney general, Loretta Lynch.

And they say Trump has chosen blatantly provocative or unqualified nominees, instead of trying to find common ground in a divided country.

""Donald Trump is kind of giving a big middle finger to that entire department by nominating someone who was found to have 50 percent of his restaurants in noncompliance with labor laws,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, told MSNBC on Friday of Trump's decision to name Puzder to head the department responsible for protecting workers. "	0
312	"As Donald Trump's 20 January inauguration draws closer, the president-elect's administration is starting to take shape. What does it tell us about what we can expect from the Trump presidency?
Although the incoming president has to fill more than 4,000 executive branch jobs scattered across dozens of agencies, departments and bureaus, there are 21 top-level Cabinet positions that require Senate confirmation. So far the Trump transition team has announced nominees for 15 of the spots (a 16th, interior secretary, is reportedly going to Ryan Zinke of Montana).
First, the basics. Of those 16, 11 are white men. For the first time since 1993, none of the top four departments - state, defence, treasury or justice - will be headed by a woman or a member of an ethnic minority group.
Ben Carson, tapped for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is the only African American. Elaine Chao (transportation) and Nikki Haley (UN ambassador) are the only Asians.
Six have previously held elective office, and one - Ms Chao - has prior experience running a federal agency. That marks a significant change from past presidential administrations, which were well stocked with more experienced political hands.
Mr Trump's Cabinet is a mix of rich businessmen, former military leaders and conservative true-believers. He may have campaigned as an anti-establishment outsider, but he's mostly surrounding himself with powerful, wealthy, influential men. While many may be outsiders to the game of elective politics, they're not exactly drawn from the ranks of the angry populist masses.
Here's a closer look at how it all shakes out.

Rex Tillerson hopes to move from the ExxonMobil boardroom to White House Cabinet meetings
American voters elected a businessman with no political experience as their president, and he's filled many of his top administration jobs with businessmen who have no political experience.
Leading the way are Rex Tillerson, who has helmed the international energy conglomerate ExxonMobil since 2006, as secretary of state, and venture capitalist and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin for Treasury.
Other notable picks include the so-called ""king of bankruptcy"", Wilbur Ross, for commerce and fast food mogul Andrew Puzder at Labor.
What we've learned: Mr Trump campaigned against a global elite that he said was stripping the working class of its wealth. By looking to Wall Street insiders and corporate chieftains for key administration spots, however, his post-election actions signal a decidedly different mentality.

Rex Tillerson - wildcard diplomat
Steven Mnuchin - Secretary of the Treasury nominee

Here come the generals
At one point during the campaign, Mr Trump quipped that he knew more about fighting the so-called Islamic State than many of the generals currently running US military operations. When it came time to fill out his national security apparatus, however, the president-elect has frequently turned to the military brass.

James Mattis (defence) and John Kelly (homeland security) are both retired generals, as is Michael Flynn, who Mr Trump has slated for national security adviser (a position that does not require Senate confirmation).
Taken individually, the picks are unremarkable - ex-military leaders sometimes wind up in the presidential administrations of both Democrats and Republicans. Colin Powell was George W Bush's secretary of state, and David Petraeus ran the Central Intelligence Agency under Barack Obama.
Together, however, Mr Trump's picks give his administration a decidedly martial bent. While he may have mocked Mr Obama's generals, Mr Trump, who attended military school as a youth, seems inclined to favour the spit and polish of military leadership.
The military is one of the few institutions still viewed favourably by the American public, and Mr Trump seems more than happy to march along with it.
What we've learned: Candidate Trump often espoused a less interventionist foreign policy on the campaign trail, but President-elect Trump's decision to surround himself with generals could indicate he will be quicker on the trigger.

The vanquished
Former presidential candidate Rick Perry once called Mr Trump a cancer on the Republican Party. Ben Carson, another primary opponent, questioned the business mogul's religious faith. Now Mr Trump has chosen both to head Cabinet departments in his administration.

There's a certain amount of irony in Mr Perry's selection, given that he is slotted to head the Department of Energy, which he famously forgot the name of when listing Cabinet-level posts he'd cut during a 2008 Republican primary debate.
Although Mr Trump has only named two former adversaries to his administration, he's also rumoured to be considering former computer executive Carly Fiorina for an intelligence agency post. Then there's New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who was reportedly offered several Cabinet-level positions after being passed over for attorney general.
He's a foe-turned-friend who now, it seems, has been forgotten.
What we've learned: Facing off against Mr Trump in the past isn't necessarily a deal-breaker for the president-elect, but a subsequent bent knee - offered both by Mr Carson and Mr Perry - is a key to bygones being bygones.

The insiders
According to a recent story in Politico, Mr Trump's transition team has been beset by conflicts between establishment party players, led by incoming chief-of-staff Reince Priebus, and the conservative outsiders who helped run the Trump campaign.
In a number of Cabinet positions, it appears the establishment landed the people they wanted. Tom Price, slated for Health and Human Services, is a member of the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. Betsy DeVos, heading to education, is a long-time conservative activist and Republican Party donor. Elaine Chao served as labour secretary under President George W Bush and is married to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, considered a party rising star, is the nominee for US ambassador to the United Nations.
Given that Mr Trump is likely to be a hands-off president when it comes to the day-to-day management of his administration, department heads will wield considerable power over the next four years.
While the president-elect has said there are portions of Barack Obama's healthcare reform that he likes, for instance, chances are Mr Price will use his health secretary authority to strip the programme of much of its power. While he may sit down with former Vice-President Al Gore to talk climate change, his Environmental Protection Agency nominee, Scott Pruitt, is an outspoken critic - and legal opponent - of the agency he will head.
What we've learned: Mr Trump railed against the political establishment on the campaign trail, but some of his nominees are very comfortable in the Washington ""swamp"". The tension between the insiders and the outsiders in the Trump transition team is likely to continue well into his presidency.

Several high-profile Trump political donors and advisers also were handed top positions, including Mr Mnuchin, Mr Ross and Mr Puzder. Linda McMahon, who gave more than $7m to the Trump campaign and affiliated political groups, is his pick to head the Small Business Administration. (She is also the largest donor to the Trump family's charitable foundation.)
Another Trump donor, Todd Ricketts, has landed a deputy position in the Commerce Department.
Meanwhile, some early, outspoken Trump advocates were passed over for plum positions - including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin and former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. They emerged from the political graveyard to take an early gamble on Mr Trump, but they have yet to be rewarded for their efforts.
What we've learned: While fiery speeches and television appearances are nice, one of the quickest ways to Mr Trump's corridors of power appears to be with an open chequebook."	0

We say that she has trouble with transparency, while her opponent refuses to release his taxes and the current administration sets records for secrecy.

We decry her ties to corporations and the financial industry, while supporting a walking tax shelter or mourning the exit of a president whose re-election was funded by a record-shattering Wall Street haul.

We list so very many explanations, all of them complete bullshit.

In truth, the Hillary haters seem to resent her more than disagree with her. They demand to be humored and catered to. They hold her to wildly different standards than her male counterparts. They regard her with an unprecedented degree of suspicion. Above all, they really, really want to see her punished. And an aggressive male presenceÃÂeven if dangerously incompetentÃÂseems to comfort a great many of them.

Everyone but them knows damn well why.

Bad news for the haters: History is decidedly unafraid of ÃÂthe woman card.ÃÂ It doesnÃÂt care how many people will stand on tables today and swear theyÃÂd feel the same if she were a man. It will see us for what we areÃÂa sick society, driven by misogyny and pathetically struggling to come to terms with the fact that women do not exist solely to nurture.

If that answer isnÃÂt as nuanced as the average thinkpiece, thatÃÂs because we, as a people, are not. No matter how many branches have formed, they all emerged from the same seed, planted way back when Bill Clinton first ran for governor. She wouldnÃÂt be so suspicious of the press, or so measured in her presentation, or so any one of a thousand other things, if she had been born a man.

The lengths we go to in order to rationalize this all will be seen, in retrospect, as extraordinary.

When the Bush administration was discovered to have erased millions of emails illegally sent by 22 administration officials through private, RNC-owned accounts, in order to thwart an investigation into the politically motivated firing of eight US attorneys, just one talk show covered it that Sunday.

When Mitt Romney wiped servers, sold government hard drives to his closest aides and spent $100,000 in taxpayer money to destroy his administrationÃÂs emails, it was barely an issue.

When Hillary Clinton asked Colin Powell how he managed to use a Blackberry while serving as Secretary of State, he replied by detailing his method of intentionally bypassing federal record-keeping laws:

I didnÃÂt have a Blackberry. What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line (sounds ancient.) So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department servers. I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts. I did the same thing on the road in hotels.

... There is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it [sic] government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law.

Yet the fact that Hillary Clinton emailed through a private server and didnÃÂt use it to cover anything up is somehow the defining issue of her campaign. ÃÂMy God,ÃÂ people cry, ÃÂanyone else would be in jail!ÃÂ

Or is the real scandal that her family runs but does not profit from a charitable foundation awarded an A grade by Charity Watch, a four out of four star rating by Charity Navigator and responsible for helping 435 million people in 180 countries get things like clean drinking water and HIV medication? Because the AP seems super concerned that she encountered people who donated to itÃÂspecifically Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad YunusÃÂin her official capacity as Secretary of State.

It should at this point be observed that her opponent is a shameless con artist who has built an empire bilking people with fake businesses, fake universities, fake charities and, now, a fake campaign. Last week, he told a lie every three minutes and fifteen seconds. Oh, and did we mention that he, like so many of his online ÃÂsupporters,ÃÂ is a goddamn Russian stooge? I tried to list all of the dumb, awful stuff that he does every day and I cannot come close to keeping up.

Voters, it seems, are his easiest marks yet.

And it isnÃÂt just Republicans. The double standards are even more transparent on the left.

Back in the mid-90s, ClintonÃÂs persistent unwillingness to hide the fact that she was a thinking human female really freaked the center-left establishment out. Michael Moore observed that, ÃÂ[Maureen Dowd] is fixated on trashing Hillary Rodham in the way liberals love to do, to prove theyÃÂre not really liberal.ÃÂ The bashing slowly morphed into a creepy, extraordinary sort of policing.

Since then, Clinton racked up a Senate voting record more liberal than any nominee since Mondale. Her 2008 platform was slightly to ObamaÃÂs left on domestic issues. Her 2016 platform was barely to the right of self-proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders.

Yet, we have all heard and seen countless liberal posers passionately decrying her ÃÂfar right voting record,ÃÂ untrustworthy promises or ever-changing policy positions. Jon Stewart recently called Clinton ÃÂa bright woman without the courage of her convictions, because I donÃÂt know what they even are.ÃÂ Because if he doesnÃÂt know, she must not have any, right?

In fact, there is a very lengthy trail of public records all pointing in the same direction. If you canÃÂt figure out which, maybe the problem is you.

Yet, many on the left who gladly voted for John Kerry, two years after he voted to authorize the Iraq war, now say they couldnÃÂt possibly vote for Clinton, because she did, too.

And view her with contempt for opposing same-sex marriage in 2008, while fawning over men like Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders, who held the same position at the same time.

ItÃÂs time to stop pretending that this is about substance. This is about an eagerness to believe that a woman who seeks power will say or do anything to get it. This is about a Lady MacBeth stereotype that, frankly, should never have existed in the first place. This is about the one thing no one wants to admit itÃÂs about.

Consider, for a moment, two people. One, as a young woman at the beginning of a promising legal career, went door to door searching for ways to guarantee an education to the countless disabled and disadvantaged children who had fallen through the cracks. The other, as a young millionaire, exacted revenge on his recently deceased brotherÃÂs family by cutting off the medical insurance desperately needed by his nephewÃÂs newborn son, who at eighteen months of age was suffering from violent seizures brought on by a rare neurological disorder.

What kind of a society treats these two people as equal in any way? What kind of society even considers the latter over the former for its highest office?

Generations from now, people will shake their heads at this moment in time, when the first female major party presidential nomineeÃÂcompetent, qualified and more thoroughly vetted than any non-incumbent candidate in historyÃÂendured the humiliation of being likened to such an obvious grifter, ignoramus and hate monger.

We deserve the shame that we will bear."	0
314	"Twenty millennial snowflakes want us to believe they got beat down by FOUR Trump supporters. And these alleged victims have ZERO evidence to support their claims.

Peter Soeller, a New York City student and civil rights activist, tweeted that he and approximately 20 of his pals were attacked by Donald Trump supporters after they left a party on Saturday night, BizPac Review reports. According to Soeller, his buddies were merely walking down the street ÃÂchantingÃÂ and laughing when four or five Trump supporters suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

The Trump supporters ÃÂconfronted us and assaulted us yelling, ÃÂBlue Lives MatterÃÂ ÃÂGet out of my country,ÃÂ calling us ÃÂfaggotsÃÂ and ÃÂcommies as they wailed on us,ÃÂ Soeller tweeted. So, there were 20 millennials on their way home from a Black Lives Matter party and not a single one of them had a cellphone to whip out and take a few seconds of video of the alleged beating?

Millennials are rarely ever separated from their phonesÃÂdoing so could lead to them missing the chance for yet another inane selfie. It is beyond illogical to think 20 college kids would leave for a night out and not one of them had a working phone.

Soeller and his friends were on their way home from the ÃÂDecolonize This PlaceÃÂ party when they were allegedly stopped by a small handful of Trump supporters. Soeller claims he and two others were the most seriously injured.

ÃÂNo more pettiness, time to organize,ÃÂ Soeller also said in his tweet. He claimed the roving mini horde of Trump supporters were trolling the streets looking for ÃÂqueer anti-Trump activists.ÃÂ

The anti-police activist also made a baseless claim about the four or five attackers who supposedly beat up the 20 millennials. Soeller claimed the Trump supporters were ÃÂoff-duty cops.ÃÂ

Why did Soeller leap to such a wild accusation? The ÃÂbuildÃÂ of the attackers and the ÃÂway they took us down,ÃÂ convinced the college student the unknown men had to be police officers.

Trump supporter attack stories appear to be all the rage since the election. The elusive Trump fans wander around city streets in search of millennials to whomp on ÃÂ at least that is what the snowflakes claim.

One such story has already been debunked. A Muslim college student who claimed she was attacked by Trump supporters who hurled Islamic slurs at her was actually just trying to stay out of trouble with her strict parents.

The Muslim girl had stayed out too late in the evening with her boyfriend and needed a sympathetic story to tell the folks. She went into great detail when describing the alleged attack to police officers, who quickly realized far too many holes existed in her tall tale.

WeÃÂll just have to wait and see if such holes start piling up in this case. IÃÂm sure the involved police officers will be paying extra close attention in the case of this cop-hating agitator and his 20 friends, who couldnÃÂt take on four or five ÃÂcop builtÃÂ guys.

Please share this story on Facebook and tell us what you think because we want to hear YOUR voice!"	1
315	"NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂWith thirteen days until his scheduled return to oblivion, many Americans are unsure if they can tolerate that much additional exposure to Rudy Giuliani, a leading psychologist said on Wednesday.

As millions of Americans actively count down the days until Giuliani disappears forever, thirteen more days of him ÃÂseems like a lifetime,ÃÂ Davis Logsdon, a psychologist who has been studying the Giuliani ordeal, said.

ÃÂAmericansÃÂ traumatic experience of Rudy Giuliani in 2016 has gone through several phases,ÃÂ Logsdon said. ÃÂFirst, they struggled to remember who he was. Then, once they remembered, they recoiled in horror. Finally, they began actively wishing he would go away forever. That is the phase many people find themselves in today.ÃÂ

Even as they long for the day when Giuliani resumes his rightful place in obscurity, many Americans are experiencing feelings of anger and disbelief that he was permitted to crawl back into their consciousness to begin with, Logsdon said.
ÃÂOf the many inexcusable things that cable news has done this election, repeatedly subjecting Americans to Rudy Giuliani is at the top of the list,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂThe human cost has been enormous.ÃÂ

As they struggle to endure the final thirteen days of Rudy Giuliani, Americans should not feel isolated or alone, Logsdon said. ÃÂThey need to know that there are millions of people just like them, and even more who are unsure if they can stand another thirteen days of Kellyanne Conway,ÃÂ he said."	0
316	"Kicking off a holiday week of meetings at his South Florida estate, President-elect Donald Trump began filling in his Pentagon staff Monday by nominating infantry veteran and New York financier Vincent ÃÂVinnieÃÂ Viola as secretary of the Army.

ÃÂWhether it is his distinguished military service or highly impressive track record in the world of business, Vinnie has proved throughout his life that he knows how to be a leader and deliver major results in the face of any challenge,"" Trump said in a statement.

Trump has pledged to increase the size of the nation's armed forces.

Viola, founder and chairman of Virtu Financial and owner of pro hockey's Florida Panthers, said in a statement that, if confirmed by the Senate, ""I will work tirelessly to provide our President with the land force he will need to accomplish any mission in support of his National Defense Strategy.""

His primary focus, Viola said, ""will be ensuring that AmericaÃÂs soldiers have the ways and means to fight and win across the full spectrum of conflict.""

Trump made the announcement the same day that members of the Electoral College cast their votes for president in state capitals across the country. While anti-Trump groups are urging electors to vote for someone else, electors are expected to ratify the New York businessman's victory in last month's election.

The president-elect is operating from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., where he plans to stay through at least Christmas Day.

As secretary of the Army, Viola would work with retired general James Mattis, whom Trump has nominated to be secretary of Defense.

In its announcement, the Trump transition team said Viola is a West Point graduate and he ""will combine a deep background in national security affairs with an impressive track record of leading and managing high-performing teams within the military and the private sector."""	0
317	"The search warrant that authorized the FBI to examine a laptop in connection with Hillary ClintonÃÂs use of a private email server as secretary of state was released today, and the Clinton camp says it shows that Director James Comey's ""intrusion"" into the election was ""utterly unjustified.""

Clinton had been dogged by the issue of her private email server throughout the campaign and Comey dealt a surprise blow when he said that the FBI was looking into the emails found on former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner's computer just days before the election.

According to the warrant and supporting documents, investigators said they found thousands of emails belonging to top Hillary Clinton adviser Huma Abedin on the computer belonging to her estranged husband, Weiner. Both of their names are redacted.

The laptop's hard drive, according to sources, was being examined in unrelated investigations into alleged sexting by Weiner.

Warrant Related to Clinton Emails to Be Unsealed Tuesday
Warrant Obtained to Start Reviewing Emails Found on Laptop Used by Clinton Aide
FBI Says Review of New Emails Doesn't Change Conclusion Clinton Shouldn't Be Charged
When discovered, the FBI believed the emails were ""outside the scope"" of their investigation into Weiner, and did not look at them beyond the subject line and e-mail address information, according to the newly released documents.

According to the affidavit, the FBI had already reviewed more than 30,000 emails and found 2,115 contained classified information, including 22 with Top Secret information.

Analysis of those emails ""revealed more than 4,000 work-related emails between [redacted] and Clinton from 2009 and 2013."" The redaction is believed to refer to Abedin.

According to the affidavit, the FBIÃÂs prior investigation found that among the 4,000, some 27 email chains containing classified information ""have been transmitted through [redacted] and/or [redacted] accounts,"" which again are believed to be between Abedin and Clinton.

""Because it has been determined by relevant original classification authorities that many emails were exchanged between [redacted] and/or [redacted] accounts and Clinton that contained classified information, there is also probable cause to believe that the correspondence between them located on Subject Laptop contains classified information,"" the affidavit says.

The FBI search of the laptop came during the final days of the presidential election, months after Comey announced that the bureau had effectively closed its investigation.

E. Randol Schoenberg, a Los Angeles attorney who petitioned to have the documents unsealed, said in a statement to ABC News he was ""appalled.""

""I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between Secretary Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin,"" he said.

On Oct. 28, Comey disclosed to Congress that the FBI would be looking at the newly discovered emails, but it remains unclear when the emails were discovered and how long it took for that information to be communicated to Comey. The warrant was approved two days later.

Just two days before the election, Comey issued a second letter to Congress, stating, ""based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.""

It's unclear what impact Comey's letters had on the election, but Clinton told top donors that she thought Comey's letter to Congress was a turning point in the contest between her and now President-elect Donald Trump.

Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted today that ""the unsealed filings regarding Huma's emails reveals Comey's intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time.""

Stephen Saltzburg, George Washington University Law Professor, said that Comey didn't need to ""run the risk"" of making Clinton look even worse right before the election -- a move that broke with FBI protocol about commenting on ongoing investigations.

""They [FBI] had to assure themselves that there was no classified information at risk on a computer that they didnÃÂt have. They had no obligation, however, to go public about what they were doing,"" he said.

Officials at both the FBI and the Department of Justice declined to comment to ABC News."	0
318	"The list of Republicans supporting Hillary Clinton is still growing. For months, we have been keeping track of all of the GOP politicians, administration officials, business leaders and donors who have crossed over to back Clinton over Donald Trump.

The most recent high-profile announced was from former secretary of state Colin Powell. ""General Powell said at a meeting of the Long Island Association that he would be voting for Hillary Clinton,"" spokeswoman Peggy Cifrino said in late October. Powell added in a brief interview with The Post's Karen DeYoung that he picked Clinton ""because I think sheÃÂs qualified, and the other gentleman is not qualified.ÃÂ

Powell's support isn't much of a surprise, given his support for President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and clear distaste for Donald Trump. In his leaked emails from last month, Powell also appeared to be talking over the best time to announce his support for Clinton.

But at least it's official now. And Powell is now the third Bush Cabinet official to support Clinton.

Below is that list as it stands:

Former presidents (1?)

319	"On Tuesday, the Times of Israel reported that an Egyptian newspaper published what it called transcripts of meetings between top US officials ÃÂ including Secretary of State John Kerry ÃÂ and Palestinian officials that could, if true, prove IsraelÃÂs accusations that the Obama regime was behind the anti-Israel UN resolution approved by the Security Council.

According to the Times of Israel:

At the same time, a report in an Israeli daily Tuesday night pointed to Britain helping draft the resolution and high drama in the hours leading up to the vote, as Jerusalem tried to convince New Zealand to bury the Security Council measure.

In a meeting in early December with top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, US Secretary of State John Kerry told the Palestinians that the US was prepared to cooperate with the Palestinians at the Security council, IsraelÃÂs Channel 1 TV said, quoting the Egyptian Al-Youm Al-Sabea newspaper.

Also present at the meeting were US National Security Adviser Susan Rice, and Majed Faraj, director of the Palestinian AuthorityÃÂs General Intelligence Service.

Kerry is quoted as saying that he could present his ideas for a final status solution if the Palestinians pledge they will support the proposed framework. The US officials advised the Palestinians to travel to Riyadh to present the plan to Saudi leaders.

According to the Times, the Egyptian report fits Israeli claims that it has ÃÂironcladÃÂ proof the Obama regime helped craft the anti-settlement resolution.

ÃÂWe have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage,ÃÂ said David Keyes, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Additionally, the Guardian said Israel may provide this information to the incoming Trump administration:

Doubling down on the claim a few hours later the controversial Israeli ambassador to Washington, Ron Dermer, went even further suggesting it had gathered evidence that it would present to the incoming Trump administration.

ÃÂWe will present this evidence to the new administration through the appropriate channels. If they want to share it with the American people, they are welcome to do it,ÃÂ Dermer told CNN.

According to Dermer, not only did the US not stand by IsraelÃÂs side during the vote, it ÃÂwas behind this ganging up on Israel at the UNÃÂ.

Jeff Dunetz noted:

Israel fears that Kerry lays out his comprehensive vision for two-state solution and then turns it into another Security Council resolution imposing additional anti-Israel settlement terms on Israel, or at upcoming peace conference in Paris on Jan. 15 that Israel is not attending, all before the Israel-hating Obama leaves the White House three weeks from this coming Friday. Another possibility is the US recognizing a Palestinian State, any of the above eliminates the possibility of a negotiated solution.

The Egyptian report did not detail whose transcripts of the meeting it had obtained or how it had obtained them.

At the end of the meeting, the report said,  Rice and Kerry requested that the content of the discussion remain secret because of the sensitivity of the matter during the transition period in the U.S. The same way Kerry kept negotiations for the Iran deal secret from Israel until it was too late.

The Obama regime, however, has denied allegations that it was behind the resolution.

ÃÂWe did not draft this resolution; we did not introduce this resolution. We made this decision when it came up for a vote,ÃÂ Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Friday."	1
320	"JERUSALEM - Doubling down on its public break with the Obama administration, a furious Israeli government on Tuesday said it had received ÃÂironcladÃÂ information from Arab sources that Washington actively helped craft last weekÃÂs U.N. resolution declaring Israeli settlements illegal.

The allegations further poisoned the increasingly toxic atmosphere between Israel and the outgoing Obama administration in the wake of FridayÃÂs vote, and raised questions about whether the White House might take further action against Israeli settlements in its final weeks in office.

With the U.S. expected to participate in an international peace conference in France next month and Secretary of State John Kerry planning a final policy speech, the Palestinians said they were hoping to capitalize on the momentum from the Security Council vote.

The U.N. vote's impact on U.S.-Israel relations
Although the U.S. has long opposed Israeli settlements on occupied lands, it has traditionally used its veto in the U.N. Security Council to protect its ally Israel from international censure. But in a change of policy, it abstained from FridayÃÂs vote, allowing the resolution to pass by a 14-0 margin.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long had a cool relationship with President Barack Obama, has called the resolution ÃÂshamefulÃÂ and accused the U.S. of playing a leading role in its passage.

On Tuesday, his spokesman went even further.

ÃÂWe have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage,ÃÂ David Keyes said.

ÃÂWeÃÂre not just going to be a punching bag and go quietly into the night as the Obama administration helps push such a grave resolution,ÃÂ he said.

He did not identify the Arab sources or say how Israel obtained the information. Israel has close security ties with Egypt, an original sponsor of last weekÃÂs resolution. Under heavy Israeli pressure, Egypt delayed the resolution last week before other council members presented it for a vote a day later. Egypt ended up voting in favor of the measure.

Keyes claim mirrors that of his boss Netanyahu, who told his Cabinet on Sunday: ÃÂFrom the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama Administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed.ÃÂ

Netanyahu insists that there is nothing wrong with his controversial policy of building Jewish towns in occupied areas that the Palestinians, with overwhelming world support, claim for their state.   

U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power defended the U.S. abstention, saying, ÃÂWe would not have let this resolution pass if it hadnÃÂt addressed counterproductive steps by the Palestinians.ÃÂ And she added that the vote ÃÂdoes not in any way diminish the United StatesÃÂ steadfast and unparalleled commitment to the security of Israel.ÃÂ  

Power also warned that settlements make it harder to negotiate a separate Palestinian state, which the administration believes is crucial to a lasting peace, CBS NewsÃÂ Margaret Brennan reports. 

ÃÂThe United States has been sending a message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for nearly five decades,ÃÂ Power said.

IsraelÃÂs recent diplomatic defeat would be much more damaging if not for a potential remaining and rather major ace in NetanyahuÃÂs hand: the incoming Trump Administration. 

In a striking departure from past policy of incumbent presidents waiting on the sidelines, Trump tried to scuttle the resolution and called for a U.S. veto. After the vote, Trump vowed that ÃÂthings will be different after Jan. 20th.ÃÂ 

Critically, he has appointed an outspoken supporter and donor to the settlements, his longtime attorney David Friedman, as ambassador to Israel. And aides say Trump is serious about a promise to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which even many Israelis fear could spark violence. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, home to sensitive religious sites, as the capital of the future state to which they aspire. 

After FridayÃÂs vote, NetanyahuÃÂs office said he looked forward to working with Trump ÃÂto negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.ÃÂ   

It remains unclear what Trump might be able to do. While he will be able to wield the U.S. veto to prevent further action against Israel in the council, mustering enough votes to overturn FridayÃÂs decision appears to be impossible. 

The basis for the resolution is found in the Geneva conventions, which forbid the settling of areas captured in war from another country. Israel has said the law doesnÃÂt apply because the territory was captured from Jordan, which has renounced all claims to the land. Israel has also defended the occupation on religious and security grounds. 

When NetanyahuÃÂs rivals in Israel oppose the settlements, it is not necessarily due to a conviction that could be peace could be at hand, but rather for concern for IsraelÃÂs democracy. If Israel becomes inseparable from the West Bank, it will have to grant its 2.5 million Palestinians voting rights, or increasingly be unable to call itself a democracy. 

The country is toxically divided on the issue, and key sectors of society, including intellectual elites and much of its security establishment, want to see settlements end. Many of them welcome - some openly, and many more quietly - any world pressure to bring that about. 

Dan Miodownik, a professor of political science and international relations at Hebrew University, said there were actually some positive elements for Israel in the resolution. 

He said it endorsed the idea of territorial swaps, meaning that Israel could keep some settlements as part of a negotiated peace deal. And the differentiation between Israel proper and the settlements signaled that unlike in the past, Israel was no longer being forced to defend its right to exist.  "	0
321	"While blasting so-called ÃÂfake newsÃÂ on Thursday, Hillary Clinton once again wore the color purple which signifies George SorosÃÂ color revolution against the Donald Trump presidency.
Clinton, who has deep ties to Soros, also wore purple during her concession speech on Nov. 9.
Soros, a socialist billionaire best known for breaking the British pound in 1992, has funded government overthrows, known as color revolutions, in Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and other countries in the former Soviet bloc, the Middle East and North Africa.
And now heÃÂs trying to do the same using far-left radicals in the U.S., if HillaryÃÂs recent penchant for the color purple is any indication.
But why purple? ItÃÂs the color resulting from mixing red and blue ÃÂ and Clinton and others pushing the upcoming ÃÂpurple revolutionÃÂ will likely justify it as the ÃÂunificationÃÂ of the divided red and blue states of America.
ÃÂAnytime globalist politicians embrace a color, be on guard for a revolution bearing that particular hue,ÃÂ reported D.C. journalist Wayne Madsen. ÃÂOn the day after the election that propelled Donald Trump into the White House, Hillary and Bill Clinton entered the ballroom of the ÃÂMoonieÃÂ Unification Church-owned New Yorker hotel in midtown Manhattan adorned in the color purple.ÃÂ
ÃÂMrs. Clinton wore a pant suit with purple lapels and a purple blouse, while Bill Clinton wore a purple tie.ÃÂ
Already many of the nationwide protests since the election were coordinated by the Soros-funded activist group MoveOn.org.
ÃÂWhen it comes to themed revolutions, the Sorosites have refined the art to a science,ÃÂ Madsen added. ÃÂWhile Mrs. Clinton called for uniting the nation in her concession speech, SorosÃÂs minions took the streets in protests, some turning violent, across the United States.ÃÂ
ÃÂClinton, who received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from Soros, showed her real intentions by signaling the start of SorosÃÂs Purple Revolution in the United States.ÃÂ"	1
322	"WASHINGTON, D.C. ÃÂ President Barack Obama will exercise his presidential powers this week when he signs an executive order directing the Supreme Court to indefinitely suspend the 22nd Amendment. Coming on the heels of the Conservative Political Action Conference held at MarylandÃÂs National Harbor, President Obama announced his decision to temporarily end presidential term limits, saying, ÃÂIÃÂm not seeing any potential presidential candidates on either side of the aisle who are capable of carrying out the task of running the country.ÃÂ

Citing ÃÂpoor performanceÃÂ on the part of a Republican-controlled congress, the struggling economy, and the continuing situation with ISIS, Obama said he feels ÃÂobligatedÃÂ to continue his term in order to steer the country away from crisis ÃÂjust like Roosevelt.ÃÂ

ÃÂThis is not something out of the ordinary,ÃÂ says political analyst Elliot Stabler. ÃÂWe already have several states with no gubernatorial term limits. Connecticut, Idaho, Massachusetts, Washington, Vermont, New York, just to name a few. In fact Michael Bloomberg repealed term limits in order to run for a third time as New York City mayor.ÃÂ

In addition Mr. Obama has ordered the National Guard to remain on standby in the months leading up to and during his third term. He will issue a second executive order authorizing the Department of Justice to temporarily suspend Habeas Corpus in the event a state of emergency is declared due to opposition to his decision to continue the presidency.

The Twenty-second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was ratified on February 27th, 1951 and sets a limit of two four-year terms for the office of the President of the United States. Since ratification there have been several unsuccessful attempts to repeal the 22nd Amendment. Most recently Democratic congressman Barney Frank and Senator Harry Reid introduced legislation to repeal presidential term limits. Republican Senator Mitch McConnell has sought to pass similar legislation. All three congressmen support ObamaÃÂs decision to take on another term, which begins January 20th, 2017."	1
323	"LAS VEGAS (The Borowitz Report)ÃÂIn what is being denounced by Republicans as an ÃÂoutrageous dirty trick,ÃÂ Hillary Clinton is seeking to seal a victory in the third Presidential debate by inviting Donald Trump to attend.

The attention-grabbing invitation, which was widely seen as retaliation for the Trump campaignÃÂs decision to invite President ObamaÃÂs estranged half brother, Malik, to the televised forum, sparked howls of protest from Republicans, who charged that Clinton was trying to gain an unfair advantage in the contest.

But ClintonÃÂs campaign chairman, John Podesta, defended the controversial invitation. ÃÂIf theyÃÂre going to have Malik at the debate, then weÃÂre going to have Donald Trump,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂTwo can play this game.ÃÂ

Appearing on CNN, TrumpÃÂs campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, blasted the Clinton campaignÃÂs invitation of Trump as ÃÂa blatant ploy to rig the debate.ÃÂ

324	"New documents scheduled to be released this week by Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, could reveal damaging information about NASAÃÂs Apollo program, believe experts.

Julian Assange, who has lived at EcuadorÃÂs London embassy since June 2012 in fear of being extradited to the United States to face espionage and conspiracy charges arising from the leaking of thousands of secret diplomatic and military documents by US Army private Chelsea Manning, has announced that he will release incriminating evidence that the government of the Unites States of America and NASA have hidden the truth about the Apollo program and the lunar landings for more than 40 years.

ÃÂ« These documents reveal the true reason behind the Apollo program deception and how this all played out in the Cold War strategy of the government of the United States at the time ÃÂ»

ÃÂ Julian Assange, Wikileaks founder

The documents are said to have been handed to the WikiLeaks founder by a ÃÂretired high ranking official of NASA that has worked within the government for over 45 yearsÃÂ, Assange told reporters.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is about to reveal documents that could prove the Apollo space program was an elaborate scheme to dupe the Russians into a space race that never occurred
Damaging information for NASA

The documents to be released this week could cause up a stir weeks after NASA has announced it is preparing for another moon landing mission in 2030.

ÃÂ«These documents that have been entrusted to me come from a highly known and respected high ranking official of the U.S. government who desires to leave this as a testament to the world before he dies. His desire is to stay anonymous as to not embroil his family and friends into a major polemic that could possibly destroy their livesÃÂ» he told reporters.

Top officials of the Chinese space program last year accused the government of the United States of ÃÂfakingÃÂ the moon landings after the Chinese lunar rover found no evidence of the Apollo program moon landings after investigating the same area where the Apollo 11 mission allegedly landed on 20 July 1969."	1
325	"RALEIGH, N.C. ÃÂ Legislators who passed the North Carolina law known as the ÃÂbathroom billÃÂ nine months ago head back to the capital on Wednesday to consider repealing it. But thereÃÂs uncertainty over exactly what lawmakers will do, in part because this Republican-controlled legislature has shown a willingness to go its own way, despite intense outside pressure to scrap the law.

Legislators returned to Raleigh for a special session called by GOP Gov. Pat McCrory to eliminate House Bill 2 -- the ÃÂbathroom billÃÂ -- which has been blasted by gay-rights groups and resulted in job losses and sporting event cancellations. 

No repeal bill backed by Republicans had been made public by midday. Instead, House Republicans returned to a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning that continued into the afternoon. They held a similar meeting that lasted for more than four hours Tuesday night. Some Republicans were unhappy after learning that Charlotte on Monday had not repealed its entire nondiscrimination ordinance, which had been the genesis of HB2, Republican repeal supporter Rep. Chuck McGrady said. 

ÃÂOn a difficult issue where the parties donÃÂt have a lot of trust, we got thrown a curveball by the less than full repeal by Charlotte,ÃÂ McGrady tweeted early Wednesday. 

The fact that McCrory called lawmakers back to Raleigh a month before their 2017 sessionÃÂs start was challenged by an opponent of HB2ÃÂs repeal. 

ÃÂThere is no extraordinary circumstance,ÃÂ said Rep. Jeff Collins, R-Nash, during a brief debate over session procedures, ÃÂother than the extraordinary hubris of a city council telling us we have to act by a certain date.ÃÂ MondayÃÂs action by the Charlotte council was contingent on HB2ÃÂs repeal by Dec. 31.  

Over the past year, there has been bitter fighting between Democrats and Republicans. Just last week, Republican leaders convened a surprise legislative session and passed two laws designed to bring Democratic Gov.-elect Roy CooperÃÂs powers in check when he becomes governor Jan. 1.

Cooper blasted McCrory over House Bill 2 during the governorÃÂs race, and the fallout over the law ÃÂ job losses, canceled concerts and sporting events ÃÂ contributed to McCroryÃÂs narrow defeat. The wide-ranging law is best known for requiring transgender people to use restrooms corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate in many public buildings.

GOP Rep. Chuck McGrady of Hendersonville supports repealing the entire law and said he believes a significant number of House members from both parties do as well.

ÃÂEverybody is acting in good faith in my opinion,ÃÂ McGrady said. House Republicans met by phone Monday and would meet in person in Raleigh later Tuesday, he said.

However, lawmakers were already under pressure from some conservative groups to keep HB2 in place.

ÃÂWeÃÂre sending the message to our supporters that lawmakers should not now betray people who supported them and compromise common-sense principles like privacy, dignity and freedom from our citizens,ÃÂ said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the North Carolina Values Coalition.

House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger have only issued a brief statement Monday, saying they ÃÂwould take up the repeal of HB2.ÃÂ They also criticized Cooper for taking too much credit.

They did not return messages for comment Tuesday.

Charlotte appears to have held up its end of the bargain, but the measure enacted Monday notes that itÃÂs dependent on HB2 being repealed in its entirety by Dec. 31. That could give some lawmakers justification not to repeal it.

Cooper, who helped broker CharlotteÃÂs cooperation with phone calls over the weekend, expects a full repeal, his spokeswoman Megan Jacobs said late Monday.

The law also limits statewide protections for LGBT people in public accommodation and employment, and it reinforced a prohibition on local governments from raising minimum wage. Local governments are also prevented from enacting nondiscrimination measures that would go further than state law.

The session is scheduled several days before Christmas, with some legislators out of town.

GOP Rep. Jeff Collins of Rocky Mount, who voted for HB2 in March, told The Wilson Times that he was not interested in repealing anything. ÃÂI think we did the right thing the first time,ÃÂ he told the newspaper.

Passing a repeal would only require a handful of GOP support ÃÂ perhaps 10 in the Senate or 15 in the House ÃÂ if all Democrats voted for it.

Discussions about repealing the law increased after decisions by the NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference to move their championship events out of North Carolina this academic year. The NBA also moved an All-Star Game out of Charlotte.

Democratic Rep. Grier Martin of Raleigh said until thereÃÂs a full repeal, ÃÂIÃÂm pretty certain that weÃÂre not going to see another NBA All-Star Game or NCAA tournament game in North Carolina.ÃÂ

LGBT advocates said they were cautiously hopeful.

ÃÂWe are holding out hope that the legislators will keep their word,ÃÂ said Simone Bell, Southern Regional Director for the LGBT-rights group Lambda Legal. ÃÂWe want complete and full repeal of HB 2.ÃÂ"	0
