How can one know if the person is infected? By the time he has a fever and/ or a cough and goes to the lung hospital, the patient may have 50% fibrosis, and then it is too late. Taiwanese experts provide simple self-monitoring that we can do every morning: Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you can do this successfully without coughing and without difficulty, without anxiety or chest tightness, it shows you do not have fibrosis and generally indicate no infection..	1.0

Berries, apples, cucumbers and tomatoes are the worst because some people eat the skin. This explains why the virus is spreading faster in the west than asia. Most Asians do not eat salad and very few people eat the skin of any fruit. We have to assume anything that comes from outside our home within 48 hours is infected.
