MR. BARDEN: Hello. My name is Mark Barden. Just four months ago, my wife Jackie and I lost our son, and our children, James and Natalie, they lost their little brother Daniel. Daniel was a first-grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our sweet, 7-year-old Daniel was one of 20 children, six adults lost on December 14th. I have to say it feels like it was just yesterday.

In our deepest grief, we were supported by the love of our families and comforted by the love and prayers we received from millions of America, from every corner of the country.

What happened in Newtown can happen anywhere. In any instant, any dad in America could be in my shoes. No one should feel the pain. No one should feel our pain or the pain felt by the tens of thousands of people whoÃ¢ÂÂve lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.

And that's why we're here. Two weeks ago, 12 of us from Newtown came to meet with U.S. senators and have a conversation about how to bring common-sense solutions to the issues of gun violence. We came with a sense of hope, optimistic that real conversation could begin that would ultimately save the lives of so many Americans. We met with dozens of Democrats and Republicans and shared with them pictures of our children, our spouses, our parents who lost their lives on December 14th.

Expanded background checks wouldn't have saved our loved ones, but still we came to support the bipartisan proposal from two senators, both with Ã¢ÂÂAÃ¢ÂÂ ratings from the NRA -- a common-sense proposal supported by 90 percent of Americans. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a proposal that will save lives without interfering with the rights of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.

We'll return home now, disappointed but not defeated. We return home with the determination that change will happen -- maybe not today, but it will happen. It will happen soon. We've always known this would be a long road, and we don't have the luxury of turning back. We will keep moving forward and build public support for common-sense solutions in the areas of mental health, school safety, and gun safety.

We take strength from the children and loved ones that we lost, and we carry a great faith in the American people.

On behalf of the Sandy Hook Promise, I would like to thank President Obama, Vice President Biden for their leadership and for standing strong and continuing to fight for a safer America. I would like to thank Senators Toomey, Manchin, Schumer and Kirk on coming together to seek common ground on legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and save lives.

And I would like to thank ConnecticutÃ¢ÂÂs Senators Blumenthal and Murphy. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve been right with us. They stood by us right from the very beginning. From the first few hours after this tragedy they were with us.

We will not be defeated. We are not defeated, and we will not be defeated. We are here now; we will always be here because we have no other choice. We are not going away. And every day, as more people are killed in this country because of gun violence, our determination grows stronger.

We leave Washington hoping that others, both here and across the country, will join us in making the Sandy Hook Promise, a pledge that we'd had great hope that more U.S. senators would take literally. I'd like to end by repeating the words with which the Sandy Hook Promise begins: Our hearts are broken. Our spirit is not.

Thank you. It is now my great pleasure to introduce the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.

THE PRESIDENT: A few months ago, in response to too many tragedies -- including the shootings of a United States Congresswoman, Gabby Giffords, whoÃ¢ÂÂs here today, and the murder of 20 innocent schoolchildren and their teachers Ã¢ÂÂ- this country took up the cause of protecting more of our people from gun violence.

Families that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders Ã¢ÂÂ- not just to honor the memory of their children, but to protect the lives of all our children. And a few minutes ago, a minority in the United States Senate decided it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt worth it. They blocked common-sense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the Senate gallery.

By now, itÃ¢ÂÂs well known that 90 percent of the American people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun. WeÃ¢ÂÂre talking about convicted felons, people convicted of domestic violence, people with a severe mental illness. Ninety percent of Americans support that idea. Most Americans think that's already the law.

And a few minutes ago, 90 percent of Democrats in the Senate just voted for that idea. But itÃ¢ÂÂs not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate just voted against that idea.

A majority of senators voted Ã¢ÂÂyesÃ¢ÂÂ to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks. But by this continuing distortion of Senate rules, a minority was able to block it from moving forward.

IÃ¢ÂÂm going to speak plainly and honestly about whatÃ¢ÂÂs happened here because the American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen. We had a Democrat and a Republican -Ã¢ÂÂ both gun owners, both fierce defenders of our Second Amendment, with Ã¢ÂÂAÃ¢ÂÂ grades from the NRA -- come together and worked together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks. And I want to thank Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their courage in doing that. That was not easy given their traditional strong support for Second Amendment rights.

As they said, nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our Second Amendment rights. All it did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the Internet. So 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system; this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system.

Their legislation showed respect for gun owners, and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence. And Gabby Giffords, by the way, is both -- sheÃ¢ÂÂs a gun owner and a victim of gun violence. She is a Westerner and a moderate. And she supports these background checks.

In fact, even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. The current leader of the NRA used to support these background checks. So while this compromise didnÃ¢ÂÂt contain everything I wanted or everything that these families wanted, it did represent progress. It represented moderation and common sense. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why 90 percent of the American people supported it.

But instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill. They claimed that it would create some sort of Ã¢ÂÂbig brotherÃ¢ÂÂ gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didnÃ¢ÂÂt matter.

And unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators. And I talked to several of these senators over the past few weeks, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre all good people. I know all of them were shocked by tragedies like Newtown. And I also understand that they come from states that are strongly pro-gun. And I have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns, and that both sides have to listen to each other.

But the fact is most of these senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun. There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt do this. It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment.

And obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse -- any excuse -- to vote Ã¢ÂÂno.Ã¢ÂÂ

One common argument I heard was that this legislation wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt prevent all future massacres. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs true. As I said from the start, no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil. We learned that tragically just two days ago. But if action by Congress could have saved one person, one child, a few hundred, a few thousand -- if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our Second Amendment rights, we had an obligation to try.

And this legislation met that test. And too many senators failed theirs.

I've heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory. And my question is, a victory for who? A victory for what? All that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check. That didnÃ¢ÂÂt make our kids safer. Victory for not doing something that 90 percent of Americans, 80 percent of Republicans, the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done? It begs the question, who are we here to represent?

I've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced. ""A prop,"" somebody called them. Ã¢ÂÂEmotional blackmail,Ã¢ÂÂ some outlet said. Are they serious? Do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence donÃ¢ÂÂt have a right to weigh in on this issue? Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?

So all in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington.

But this effort is not over. I want to make it clear to the American people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people donÃ¢ÂÂt give up on it. Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to address the barriers that prevent states from participating in the existing background check system. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns so it can do its job. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to help to put in place emergency plans to protect our children in their schools.

But we can do more if Congress gets its act together. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters.

To all the people who supported this legislation -- law enforcement and responsible gun owners, Democrats and Republicans, urban moms, rural hunters, whoever you are -- you need to let your representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and that if they donÃ¢ÂÂt act this time, you will remember come election time.

To the wide majority of NRA households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in Washington know they didnÃ¢ÂÂt represent your views on this one.

The point is those who care deeply about preventing more and more gun violence will have to be as passionate, and as organized, and as vocal as those who blocked these common-sense steps to help keep our kids safe. Ultimately, you outnumber those who argued the other way. But they're better organized. They're better financed. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve been at it longer. And they make sure to stay focused on this one issue during election time. And that's the reason why you can have something that 90 percent of Americans support and you can't get it through the Senate or the House of Representatives.

So to change Washington, you, the American people, are going to have to sustain some passion about this. And when necessary, youÃ¢ÂÂve got to send the right people to Washington. And that requires strength, and it requires persistence.

And that's the one thing that these families should have inspired in all of us. I still don't know how they have been able to muster up the strength to do what theyÃ¢ÂÂve doing over the last several weeks, last several months.

And I see this as just round one. When Newtown happened, I met with these families and I spoke to the community, and I said, something must be different right now. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to change. That's what the whole country said. Everybody talked about how we were going to change something to make sure this didn't happen again, just like everybody talked about how we needed to do something after Aurora. Everybody talked about we needed change something after Tucson.

And IÃ¢ÂÂm assuming that the emotions that weÃ¢ÂÂve all felt since Newtown, the emotions that weÃ¢ÂÂve all felt since Tucson and Aurora and Chicago -- the pain we share with these families and families all across the country whoÃ¢ÂÂve lost a loved one to gun violence -- IÃ¢ÂÂm assuming that's not a temporary thing. IÃ¢ÂÂm assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.

I believe weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of these children demand it. And so do the American people.

Thank you very much, everybody.

1	"Money woes in the most populous US state have given birth to an impromptu trading market for the newest of American financial instruments Ã¢ÂÂ the California IOU.

Encumbered by a $26bn (ÃÂ£16bn) budget shortfall and a seemingly intractable political stalemate, California's state government is issuing IOUs to businesses, health clinics, college students and taxpayers who are owed money by the state.

The green documents look like any ordinary cheque except for the words ""registered warrant"" stamped in the corner. They carry a 3.75% interest rate and can be cashed in October, by which time California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is hoping that he will have some money.

Entrepreneurs have been quick to leap on the phenomenon, with Craigslist and eBay cluttered with offers. A website, BuyMyIOU.com, aims to match sellers of the warrants with buyers eager to snap up the above-market interest rate.

""The market's at an early stage Ã¢ÂÂ we're really in the infancy of it right now,"" said Mark Granger, president of Pacific West Managers, a finance company offering to buy IOUs. ""It's a little unusual to see the state of California resorting to paying its bills like this.""

California is the world's eighth largest economy but its financial situation is grave. The once booming property market has been hit catastrophically by foreclosures and its wealthy elite have seen their income wiped out by stockmarket woes. Usually 1% of the population contribute 50% of income tax revenue, but the capital gains of these rich individuals have evaporated.

Dismal relations between Democrats and Republicans have all but frozen business in the state capital, Sacramento. A two-thirds majority is required to pass any budget, but Republicans, with just over a third of the legislature, are refusing to countenance tax rises while the Democrats are balking at spending cuts.

Schwarzenegger has proposed deep cuts to social programmes, including aid for the elderly, disabled and impoverished, plus cuts to schools, healthcare and universities. Larry Gerston, a professor of political science at San JosÃÂ© State University, says this will accentuate an already yawning gap between the rich and poor: ""The state is quickly becoming an hourglass economy. The middle class is all but evaporating Ã¢ÂÂ people are either moving further to the top or sinking to the bottom.""

The initial victims of the standoff are California's creditors, who had received 91,000 IOUs worth $354m as of the end of Thursday. High-street banks, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase, agreed to cash them for a few days but announced that they would not accept them beyond the end of the week.

""There's a sentiment inside the banks that the longer they accept the warrants, the longer the budget impasse will go on,"" said Beth Mills, a spokeswoman for the Californian Bankers Association.

That leaves IOU holders with limited options. Certain local credit unions are still taking the notes at face value. Beyond that, holders face a choice of either waiting until October to receive their money or selling them at a discount on a rapidly developing informal market.

Many online offers for the IOUs propose dubious rates. On eBay, one buyer was willing to pay $140 in return for $170 worth of IOUs. Granger, whose firm sees the debt crisis as a potentially lucrative opportunity, said a market rate was emerging of between 80 and 95 cents on the dollar. ""Because they're cumbersome and troublesome to deal with, a lot of the big investment houses are not going to deal with them,"" he said. ""And some people will just put them in their piggy banks.""

Last week, the credit agency Fitch cut its rating on California's debt by two notches from ""A minus"" to BBB - just two levels above ""junk"" status. Analysts fear that there could be weeks of IOUs to come.

Gerston says a confrontational culture of extreme left-wing and right-wing politics has contributed to the morass, as has a reluctance to wake up to problems: ""Californians are known as laidback for a reason they've earned that reputation. Most people just don't believe what's in front of them. They just don't buy it."""	0

Trump warns Russia to reverse its decision immediately else he would use the countryÃ¢ÂÂs own constitution against them.

Ã¢ÂÂYou know right that this is contrary to the constitution of the land of the Russia Federation. I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against youÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Trump warned.

Trump went on to invite all JehovahÃ¢ÂÂs Witnesses in Russia to seek asylum in the United States until their religious rights are reinstated in Russia.

Ã¢ÂÂAs this is an infringement of your fundamental human rights, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Trump urged.

RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs Supreme Court ruled on April 20, 2017 that the JehovahÃ¢ÂÂs Witnesses organization should be closed down and no longer allowed to operate legally in Russia, Human Rights Watch said today. The ruling, which affects more than 100,000 JehovahÃ¢ÂÂs Witness worshippers across Russia, is a serious breach of RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs obligations to respect and protect religious freedom.

The case could be taken to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled a previous attempted ban on JehovahÃ¢ÂÂs Witnesses in Russia unlawful in 2010.

The Supreme Court was deciding on a claim lodged by the Russian ministry of justice to liquidate the groupÃ¢ÂÂs administrative centre near St Petersburg and 395 local organizations. Its decision will come into effect within 30 days unless an appeal is lodged, when it will be delayed until the resolution of the case.

Ã¢ÂÂThe Supreme Court has ruled to sustain the claim of RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs ministry of justice and deem the Ã¢ÂÂAdministrative Centre of JehovahÃ¢ÂÂs Witnesses in RussiaÃ¢ÂÂ organization extremist, eliminate it and ban its activity in Russia,Ã¢ÂÂ said judge Yuri Ivanenko. Ã¢ÂÂThe property of the JehovahÃ¢ÂÂs Witnesses organization is to be confiscated to the state revenue.Ã¢ÂÂ

A lawyer for the justice ministry, Svetlana Borisova, told the court adherents Ã¢ÂÂpose a threat to the rights of the citizens, public order and public securityÃ¢ÂÂ.

JehovahÃ¢ÂÂs Witnesses, who are known for door-to-door preaching and handing out literature, reject some of mainstream ChristianityÃ¢ÂÂs core beliefs and have more than 8.3 million members around the world"	1

Liberal rag Huffington Post is really running with this story from The Washington Post about the CIA Ã¢ÂÂconfirmingÃ¢ÂÂ Russian interference in the presidential election.

TheyÃ¢ÂÂre saying if 100% true, the courts can PUT HILLARY IN THE WHITE HOUSE!

Scary!

From HuffPo:

A 1995 federal court ruling out of Pennsylvania may offer some clues to Clinton supporters as to possible legal authority for removing an elected official from office and replacing them with their erstwhile opponent.

In light of late-breaking reports Friday evening that Russians interfered with the 2016 presidential election to assist Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs victory, Clinton supporters are furiously in pursuit of remedies.

At 10:45 p.m. Friday evening, the Washington Post broke an explosive story alleging that Russians had interfered with the 2016 presidential election in order to assist Donald Trump in a victory over democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.

The development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become Ã¢ÂÂfaithlessÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂconscientiousÃ¢ÂÂ electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.

The electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like HamiltonÃ¢ÂÂs Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nationÃ¢ÂÂs highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.

Proponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives."	1
5	"""All Legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.""

(Article I, Section 1, of the United States Constitution)

How Are Laws Made?

Laws begin as ideas. First, a representative sponsors a bill. The bill is then assigned to a committee for study. If released by the committee, the bill is put on a calendar to be voted on, debated or amended. If the bill passes by simple majority (218 of 435), the bill moves to the Senate. In the Senate, the bill is assigned to another committee and, if released, debated and voted on. Again, a simple majority (51 of 100) passes the bill. Finally, a conference committee made of House and Senate members works out any differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The resulting bill returns to the House and Senate for final approval. The Government Printing Office prints the revised bill in a process called enrolling. The President has 10 days to sign or veto the enrolled bill."	1

The Syrian Arab Red Crescent statement was reported, and at the time we had no reason to believe it was not true. Subsequent questions have emerged, however, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent is saying they are unaware of such a statement having ever been issued by the Syrian branch. They further say the Syrian Red Crescent was shut down in Douma effective April 7.

Ã¢ÂÂ

The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma. The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.

The Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didnÃ¢ÂÂt seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they mightÃ¢ÂÂve been exposed to.

(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)

Chemical attack or no, it wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didnÃ¢ÂÂt get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.

The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning. With White Helmets claiming scores killed and over 500 wounded by exposure, it seems impossible to believe that if it was true no one can find any of these Ã¢ÂÂrealÃ¢ÂÂ patients to confirm an attack."	1
7	"In a speech posted on Medium, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered a striking statistic about gun violence and minority youth.

""Gun violence,"" she wrote, ""is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.""

We wondered whether this is correct, so we took a closer look.

We found the relevant data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014.

So even if you look only at gun-related homicides, there were 2,256 of those in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs statement correct.

If you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further.

There were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns.

We should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases.

That said, we think ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs definition of ""young"" as 15-24 is a reasonable one.

Our ruling

Clinton said, ""Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.""

As long as you define ""young"" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs statement is accurate, according to CDC data. We rate the statement True."	0

Jake Tapper introduced the candidates and the debate began.

TAPPER: Governor Kasich, we will start with you.

KASICH: Well, thank you. You know, I look in the faces of people all across this country, and I know they want to be hopeful. And many are hopeful. Look, I can take conservative policies to the White House, to Washington, to restore the strength of our economy. But I also want to transfer power, money and influence to where you live, because I believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods, the families, the communities and our states.

And I believe it's a new partnership -- a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of America and strengthen America for the best century we've ever had.

Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

TAPPER: Senator Rubio?

RUBIO: Every election is important. I believe this is the most important election in a generation. Because what's at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins. What's at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people.

RUBIO: For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation. And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the 21st century is going to be a new American century.

(APPLAUSE)

TAPPER: Senator Cruz?

CRUZ: Fifty-nine years ago, Florida welcomed my father to America as he stepped off the ferry boat from Cuba onto Key West. He was 18. He was filled with hopes and dreams, and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth.

This election, this debate is not about insults. It's not about attacks. It's not about any of the individuals on this stage. This election is about you and your children. It's about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America.

(APPLAUSE)

TAPPER: Mr. Trump?

TRUMP: One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party. Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting. They're voting out of enthusiasm. They're voting out of love. Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before -- 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old -- never voted before.

We're taking people from the Democrat Party. We're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It's very exciting. I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening.

We're having millions of extra people join. We are going to beat the Democrats. We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be. And we're going to beat them soundly.

(APPLAUSE)

TAPPER: Thank you. Thank you.

Let's begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election. There have been some real differences expressed in -- on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers. One of Mr. Trump's, the front runner's, signature issues is ending what he calls ""disastrous trade deals"" in order to bring jobs back to America.

Advertisement

Governor Kasich, I'd like to start with you. You've been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years. Critics say these deals are great for corporate America's bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs. How do you respond to the criticism that you've been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class?

KASICH: Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family. And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade. One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it.

But my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, ""Oh, America was right,"" and people are out of work.

The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker.

But we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. People will buy less. Other people will be out of work. And we don't want to see that happen.

Trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up.

And Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar. I understand their plight.

(APPLAUSE)

TAPPER: Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you've brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico.

Why should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses? TRUMP: Because nobody knows the system better than me. I know the H1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I'm a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries -- the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete.

So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.

TAPPER: Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you're, quote, ""generally very much in favor of free trade."" More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals. If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs?

RUBIO: No, I support free trade deals that are good for America. We're 5 percent of the world's population. If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.

The problem is we're a low-tariff country. To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.

There are good trade deals and there are bad ones. So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia. It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. We have a surplus with Colombia.

On the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century.

(APPLAUSE)

TAPPER: Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position. Why should these voters who don't like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years?

CRUZ: Actually that's incorrect. There are two different agreements. There's TPA and TPP. I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans. But we're getting killed in international trade right now. And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We're driving jobs overseas.

And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.

And you've got to understand. Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. So the question is, what's the solution? It's easy to talk about the problems. But do you have a solution to fix it? And I think the solution is several things.

Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room. Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back. And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America.

(APPLAUSE)

TAPPER: Let's talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers. Let's go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen.

DINAN: Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers. Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements. You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers. Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans?

RUBIO: If it's being abused the way Disney did. Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers. Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans. And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again.

The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India. That company then hoards up all of these visas. They hire workers. You hire -- Disney or some other company hires this company.

What they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business. And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.

It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans. And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future.

DINAN: Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this.

(APPLAUSE)

You've -- in the -- in the context of illegal immigration, you've called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured.

RUBIO: Correct.

DINAN: Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you've talked about are solved.

RUBIO: Well first, I think -- well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause. But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law. What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.

If there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law. And what I'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not -- what they are doing is they are eliminating the job.

They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company. They are making the argument that we didn't replace you. We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead. And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad. It's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way.

(APPLAUSE)

DINAN: Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next. Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, ""lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers"". He's calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers. Wouldn't that help workers in the U.S.?

KAISCH: Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here. I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration.

Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. But we clearly have to control our borders. We can't have people just walking in. Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So, we -- I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration.

I would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can't continue this problem. I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home.

And I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.

But let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget.

We can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington. And guess what, I've used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I've been governor

DINAN: Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you. Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like.

TRUMP: I will. First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well. And it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it. We shouldn't have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.

When it's sitting there waiting for you, but it's very bad. It's very bad for business in terms of -- and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. And we should end it. Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read.

And I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he's the only one that's going to be able to fix it. Because it is a mess. I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what's going on.

We have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work. And we're rushing into things, and we're just -- we're leading with the chin.

(BELL RINGS)

We're leading with people that don't know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. I'd say a minimum of one year, maybe two years.

DINAN: Senator Cruz, I want to bring you in very quickly on this.

(APPLAUSE)

DINAN: The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers. What should the right level be?

CRUZ: Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy. Right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers. What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans. Our system isn't working. And then on top of that, we've got a system that's allowing in millions of people to be here illegally.

And the answer to that, I've laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. We're going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. We're going to end sanctuary cities. And let me tell you how we're going to do that.

We're going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws.

(APPLAUSE)

CRUZ: We're going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. And the thing to understand, Stephen, we can solve these problems. It's not that we don't know how to do it. It's that we're lacking the political will. Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this.

The Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.

CRUZ: We need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country. We need an immigration system that takes care of the jobs of the working men and women of this country.

(APPLAUSE)

TAPPER: Senator Rubio, did you want to weigh in?

RUBIO: Well, I would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren't actually workers at all. They are just coming in primarily based on family connection. And ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system.

The problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago. The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills. When my parents came, they had a very limited education. My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. And I'm grateful every day that America welcomed them.

But today in the 21st Century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don't have skills is very difficult. We need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on H-1B, particularly on green cards. The primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st Century should be, what skills do you have? What business are you going to open? What investment are you going to make? What job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the United States?

(APPLAUSE)

TAPPER: Education obviously plays a large role when it comes to jobs and the economy. The United States has long been falling behind others in the industrialized world. American students currently rank 27th out of 34 countries in math and 17th in reading.

Mr. Trump, you've called the education standards known as Common Core a disaster. What are your specific objections to Common Core?

TRUMP: Education through Washington, D.C. I don't want that. I want local education. I want the parents, and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great.

And it was very interesting, I was with Dr. Ben Carson today, who is endorsing me, by the way, tomorrow morning, and he is...

(APPLAUSE)

TRUMP: We were talking. We spoke for over an hour on education. And he has such a great handle on it. He wants competitive schools. He wants a lot of different things that are terrific, including charter schools, by the way, that the unions are fighting like crazy. But charter schools work and they work very well.

So there are a lot of things. But I'm going to have Ben very involved with education, something that's an expertise of his.

TAPPER: OK. But just to clarify, the Common Core standards were developed by the states, states and localities voluntarily adopt them, and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards. So when you say ""education by Washington, D.C.,"" what do you mean?

TRUMP: You're right, Jake. But it has been taken over by the federal government. It was originally supposed to be that way. And certainly sounds better that way. But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what's happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases.

Now in some cases they would be. But in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children.

(APPLAUSE)

TAPPER: Governor Kasich, you have called opposition to Common Core hysteria. What is your response to grassroots conservatives who do not agree with you?

KASICH: Well, look, all I'm in favor of in Ohio is high standards. First of all, let me tell you, I would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states. OK, I've been working on this for many, many years.

Secondly, Jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards. And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately. They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum.

Not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state.

Now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids? We need to start connecting them to the real world. We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century, not the jobs of 20 years ago.

We need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs.

Frankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their God-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion. And that's exactly what we're doing in Ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be.

So let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards. That's what it is in the state of Ohio.

(APPLAUSE)

TAPPER: So, Senator Cruz, let me bring you in. You object to Common Core. Governor Kasich says it's local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards. What's wrong with that?

CRUZ: Common Core is a disaster. And if I am elected president, in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day.

(APPLAUSE)

CRUZ: Now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it's easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions. The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states. It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core.

Now, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that.

(APPLAUSE)

Beyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments.

And let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships. And give every child -- African American, Hispanic -- every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education.

(APPLAUSE)

TAPPER: Let's move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida. Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country. There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they're very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations.

Let me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.

BASH: Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable. For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans. So, what should the new retirement age be? And how much will those benefits be cut?

RUBIO: Well, first of all, let me say that you're right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare. One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today. I'm against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother. And we don't have to make any changes for them. But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, ""We don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,"" they're not being honest with you.

Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents.

For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68. If I were still in the Senate, I'd be one of the youngest people there.

(LAUGHTER)

If I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money. And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better. Medicare Advantage does that now.

These are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire.

(APPLAUSE)

BASH: Senator, the question was specific though. You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits?

RUBIO: Well, I'm sorry I didn't answer that part. So the thing is that my -- my generation, someone my age would retire at 68. We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. And so my children would retire at 70. I would retire at 68. It would be a graduating scale over a period of time.

But again I'm talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old. We're years away from retirement. For people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all. If we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis. It's not a question of if. It is a question of when. In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt.

That's -- all of it will be eaten up by that. That's a debt crisis. And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis.

(APPLAUSE)

BASH: Mr. Trump, you don't want to raise the retirement age, and you also don't want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans. But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?

TRUMP: Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I've watched them very intensely, even though it's a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security. They're leaving it the way it is. In fact, they want to increase it. They want to actually give more.

And that's what we're up against. And whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against.

I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant.

TRUMP: And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.

You have 22 years, you have a long time to go. It's not long in terms of what we're talking about, but it's still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP...

I mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters. If that ever happened in China. you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a -- it's a national tragedy. We're at zero, we're not doing anything.

We've lost our jobs. We've lost everything. We're losing everything. Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country. I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is. We're going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business.

(APPLAUSE)

BASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump. You're talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you're talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent. So how would you find that other $147 million?

TRUMP: Because they don't cover most of the subjects. We're the policemen of the world. We take care of the entire world. We're going to have a stronger military, much stronger. Our military is depleted. But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea. We take -- every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. We get virtually nothing.

We have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea. We have so many places. Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them. We are going to be in a different world. We're going to negotiate real deals now, and we're going to bring the wealth back to our country. We owe $19 trillion. We're going to bring wealth back to our country. (APPLAUSE)

BASH: Senator Rubio, will that be enough to save Social Security?

RUBIO: No. And I -- and I think you've outlined why. The numbers don't add up. You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we're going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that's the end of your campaign. In Florida, you can't talk about that, but people know that it's the truth her"	0
12	"In his press conference on March 11, 2011, President Barack Obama talked up U.S. oil production against a backdrop of rising prices at the pump.



""We need to continue to boost domestic production of oil and gas,"" he said. ""Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt match up with reality,""



In this item, weÃ¢ÂÂll check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasnÃ¢ÂÂt ""shut down"" oil production -- that ""last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003.""



We turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal governmentÃ¢ÂÂs official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said ""oil production,"" we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products.



Here are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003:



2003: 2,073,453,000

2004: 1,983,302,000

2005: 1,890,106,000

2006: 1,862,259,000

2007: 1,848,450,000

2008: 1,811,817,000

2009: 1,956,596,000

2010: 2,011,856,000



So, 2010 is definitely the highest since 2003. But weÃ¢ÂÂll note a couple of caveats.



First, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing 2009 and 2010 statistics, petroleum production only rose about 3 percent. And the level for 2010 is only 11 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic.



The second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years.



Domestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by 110,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by an additional 130,000 barrels per day in 2012. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower 48 states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling.



So Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003, but weÃ¢ÂÂre taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True."	0

THE LEAD WITH JAKE TAPPER

Interview With Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel; Guns in Schools; Interview with Randi Weingarten of American Federation of Teachers; The Plot to Rig the Race; What's Behind Auto Industry's Comeback?

Aired April 2, 2013 - 16:00 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is with us this afternoon, but I assure you, parents, there will be no cursing.



I'm Jake Tapper, and this is THE LEAD.



The national lead. An NRA task force lays out ideas to put a good guy with a gun in every school. I will ask Mayor Emanuel how that is going to apply in Chicago, which buries hundreds of people from gun violence every year.



Also in national news, cheating on standardized tests, but not by students, by the school officials responsible for administering them. Now they're getting the ultimate detention in a jail cell.



And the money lead. If there was a traffic sign that represented the auto industry just a few years ago, it would be rough road ahead. Did it take a little Italian carmaker to help turn -- Chrysler turn the corner?



The national lead. It is an idea that could lead to kindergarten teachers carrying Glocks, principals spending their extracurricular time at target ranges.



Today, a task force commission by the National Rifle Association unveiled a report with recommendations to make schools safer. The most controversial idea would put more guns in our nation's schools. The task force backed off the notion of putting armed volunteers in schools, but it wants to see more teachers and administrators trained and armed.



Former Republican Congressman Asa Hutchinson is leading the task force and urging action on its recommendations.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



ASA HUTCHINSON, FORMER UNDERSECRETARY FOR HOMELAND SECURITY: If you are interested in making our schools safer and to save children's lives, look at these recommendations seriously.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: We have seen so many Newtown parents advocating for gun control after 20 children were killed in a senseless massacre in December. But today we saw a Newtown parent standing with the NRA's task force.

MARK MATTIOLI, FATHER OF NEWTOWN VICTIM: I think politics need to sort of be set aside here. And I hope this doesn't lead to name calling, but rather this is recommendations for solutions, real solutions that will make our kids safer.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: If there is a city that sees the toll of gun violence every single day, it's Chicago, more than 500 homicides last year and almost 90 percent of them were gun-related. And yet Chicago has some of the most strict gun control laws in the nation.



And Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel joins me now.



Mr. Mayor, thanks for joining us.



One of the recommendations issued today was that more individuals, more adults in schools become proficient in guns. I'm wondering your reaction to that.



RAHM EMANUEL (D), MAYOR OF CHICAGO: No, look, I think that is not what schools are for and that's not where you want the time and training for principals and teachers. You want that on the education of our children. There's a whole host of things to do different as it relates to safety in schools, but training principals and teachers on use of handguns is not one of them.



TAPPER: A lot of people look to the city of Chicago and they say, here's a city with some of the strictest gun control laws in the country. And although crime and homicide has gone down this year, it still has a staggeringly high homicide rate.



How do you reconcile that?



EMANUEL: Well, Jake, first of all, as you know, March, our homicides dropped nearly 70 percent; in February, it dropped 50 percent. And in the first three months are down a total of 50 homicides, 42 percent. So it's a very significant drop and one of the most -- March was one of the biggest one-month drops in the history of the city of Chicago.



Second is, it's, you know, people in the city of Chicago, there are gun purchases done in Indiana, brought over. So you need a uniform policy on gun control. As I've always said, it comes down to the four P's.



And it's not one of them; it's all of them: policing, and so being strategic about your police resources where you apply them; smart prevention, like after school programs and summer jobs to make sure kids have a positive thing to do and are out of harm's way; stiffer penalties, like a three-year minimum for gun crimes, first prevent people from getting guns -- criminals, second if the criminals commit the crimes there's swift punishment; and fourth P is sound parenting, teaching kids right from wrong.



And all four of those P's have to work. Now there cannot be over-focus on gun control. But you can't also wipe it off the table as if it's not part of it. And you can't rely only on policing and forget parenting. And you can't also not participate and have a comprehensive after school program to keep your kids when the school bell goes off.



All four P's, policing, prevention, penalties and parenting have to work together. Gun control matters. And what happens across the border in either Indiana or Wisconsin affects the Chicago area. We take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A.



Yes, we have good and strong gun laws. But we're as good and comprehensive working with our policing and our parenting and our prevention programs as the actual background checks are that apply to Indiana where a lot of purchases are made before the gun ends up in the city of Chicago. So you have to be smart about it.



You have to -- you have to have stiff gun control laws. And I believe firmly in preventing criminals getting access to them. But you have to focus on every one of those aspects that, in my view, have a policy that makes sure that you have police on the street, getting kids, guns and drugs off the streets.



And all of those have to work, not one of them, and not one of them have -- be allowed to take off the table as if it's not part of the overall solution to safety and security of our streets.



TAPPER: The president is hitting the road tomorrow to start campaigning further for greater gun restrictions. Do you regret, when you were White House chief of staff, that the White House in the first term under President Obama, did not do more on this issue?



EMANUEL: Well, look, you know, as chief of staff -- and you remember, Jake, because you were there; you were covering it.



You were covering the decision to make -- to take the auto industry that was on its knees, to close to collapse, and make sure that those jobs were created and made sure that the auto industry came back to the point it is today, that it's adding more jobs than it was when the president was there.



That was a crisis he inherited; it was one that took a lot of time and painstaking work to fix in the same way that the economy was headed -- going head over heels towards what is now known as the great recession. And it took a lot on that aspect in the financial sector. And to govern, as President Kennedy said, is to make a set of choices.



And the president made a set of choices to put in place the things that were necessary, given the financial, economic and auto manufacturing crises that he faced, not one of them, not two of them, all three of them simultaneously.



And for people to then kind of look back and said, you know, in the middle of either the financial or the auto scandal, he should have done X, there are choices you make. And he has properly given post- Newtown and part other things that have happened in America making sure that Washington now gets in place the gun control laws that are necessary to prevent criminals' access to guns.



But the notion that somehow in retrospect you should have pushed the auto industry crisis to the side, or the financial crisis to the side, you were there covering it; and you know that -- what the state of mind and where we were at that time.



So this is where he is now in the second term and taking control of this situation, making sure that we have, for the first time since when I was in the White House under President Clinton, I was a point person for passing both the Brady bill and the assault weapon ban that we have the opportunity actually to make progress on getting sound, comprehensive gun control legislation that works with policing, prevention programs and encouraging strong parenting.



TAPPER: Lastly, Mr. Mayor, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is speaking this evening and it's garnering a lot of media attention and buzz. She is the power player if she decides to run for president.



Do you think she is beatable if she runs for the Democratic nomination? Could anyone beat her?



EMANUEL: Well, I -- look, I think that's way ahead of yourself, Jake. But that would not be the first time anybody and me got way ahead of themselves.



(LAUGHTER)



EMANUEL: So, look, she'll speak; there will be a lot of excitement. She has, as you no doubt -- and you know how close I am to the Clintons and that she has a lot to offer if she decides to do that. And there's no doubt, both on her record as former first lady, secretary of state, senator from the state of New York, she has a lot to offer.



TAPPER: So you're not going to -- you're not even going to touch it, whether or not anybody could beat her?



EMANUEL: Well, we can go back and talk about the 69 percent drop in homicides in Chicago.



TAPPER: All right. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, thank you so much for joining us today.



EMANUEL: Thanks, Jake.



TAPPER: Ever wonder why so few folks responsible for the financial crisis seem to have been punished in any way?



Well, some say those in charge of regulation and enforcement did not do their jobs with the vigor and aggressiveness necessary. Now, why would that be? Today, we learned the former head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Mary Schapiro is joining the consulting firm Promontory Financial Group, which advises, you guessed it, financial firms.



The mission of the SEC -- and I quote -- ""is to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets."" Schapiro took the helm at the embattled SEC in January of 2009, and while many praise her for restoring the all-but-nonexistent reputation of that agency at that time, she's also been criticized for never fully holding Wall Street accountable for the worst misdeeds that caused the financial crisis.



Her announcement comes just days after we learned that Lanny Breuer, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, has left the Justice Department and rejoined the law firm of Covington & Burling as vice chairman. Covington & Burling represents a long list of big bank clients tied to the financial crisis.



Breuer was criticized for not pursuing prosecutions against big bank malfeasance while at the Justice Department. Neither Schapiro nor Breuer responded to our requests for comment.



It was hailed as an epic turnaround. Atlanta schools went from bad to good in a matter of years. Now teachers are accused of cheating in order to line their own pockets. But is the federal government partly to blame?



Plus, how much does city hall go for these days? A New York mayoral candidate is accused of trying to bribe his way on to the ticket. Our national news continues next.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



TAPPER: In other national news, charges of racketeering, theft and corruption in two states, but we're not talking about the mob.



We begin with Atlanta's public school system, 35 teachers and school administrators, indicted for filling in the right answers on their students' standardized tests starting all the way back in one 2001. Why? To make it look like their kids were improving faster than they really were. Those teachers now have until midnight tonight to turn themselves in. Several have already done so.



Joining me now, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.



Ms. Weingarten, you issued a statement about this scandal, saying it -- quote -- ""crystallizes the unintended consequences of our test- crazed policies.""



What did you mean by that?



RANDI WEINGARTEN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS: Well, first, Jake, let me just also say that in that statement and throughout this period of time, we have to say at the outset that cheating cannot be condoned, and this is a very sad day for Atlanta.



And, frankly, our union, our local back in 2005, when they saw the irregularities, whistle-blew the situation and was ignored. So, the bottom line is we can't condone cheating. And the vast number of teachers do an extraordinary job and do not succumb to cheating.



But, at the same time, we have seen in city after city and state after state an environment and a climate that says that the tests are more important than anything else for kids, for teachers, and for schools, more important than teaching and learning, more important than critical thinking, more important than problem solving, more important than integrity.



TAPPER: You say that, but most of the teachers and administrators in this system seem to have had no problem operating within the confines of the law.



The NATE scores, the state testing scores, have gone up, not just with these specific teachers and administrators, but across the state. So why do you think this is related to teaching to the test, as opposed to just teachers trying to get ahead? We know that the administrator got big bonuses based on these improvements.



WEINGARTEN: Well, you know, what -- if you talk to teachers about getting paid based upon test scores, they will universally recoil from it and get very insulted by it. But at the same time, what we've seen is in 37 or 38 different places, we've seen this huge emphasis on testing and testing has narrowed the curriculum and has done -- and, worse, a lot of the tests that we have right now are not even correlated to what kids really need in a knowledge economy.



But you are right. Most people did not succumb to cheating. Most people in Atlanta did the right thing. But what we're seeing throughout the United States is that much more time is focused on testing as opposed to teaching and learning.



Let's take Florida. In Florida, you have almost 80 days a year where some testing is going on in any particular school district. In New York state, where I served on the Cuomo commission, we saw from some superintendents in Rochester, Monroe County, they told us in the first four weeks over 20,000 pretests were being given to kids to 4,000 kids in that district.



TAPPER: All right. Thank you so much. We'll have you on again to talk more about education reform.



WEINGARTEN: Thank you. Thanks. Good luck with the gig.



TAPPER: Thank you so much.



From Atlanta to New York City, where in the race to replace Mayor Bloomberg comes a case prosecutors are calling an unappetizing smorgasbord of graft and greed. It reads like a sleazy dime store novel from yesteryear. A Democratic state senator who wanted to be the next mayor of New York City -- good luck with that now -- figured his best chance was to run as a Republican. So he allegedly bribed GOP county leaders to back him with money he got from a real estate tycoon. Too bad the guy bankrolling him was actually an undercover FBI agent. For today's installment of ""Explain This to Me,"" we turn to host of New York 1's ""Road to City Hall,"" Errol Louis.



Errol, explain this to me, who is this guy?



ERROL LOUIS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Who is this guy? Well, Malcolm Smith used to be the top Democrat in the New York State Senate, so he actually had quite a lot of power back in 2009. His colleagues unfortunately dumped him after about six months. So, his star was not exactly on the rise. Then he just decided that maybe he could run for mayor.



What everyone is mesmerized by, Jake, is the fact that there are so few Republicans in New York City that if you can round up even less than 50,000 votes you can be the nominee and if you get a stroke of luck as Mayor Bloomberg did or Rudy Giuliani did, it's tantalizing. People think maybe they can become mayor.



TAPPER: Fascinating.



And, Errol, lastly, cash changing hands, parking lots, hushed conversations in restaurants, is this just how business is done in New York City?



LOUIS: Well, you know, one of the people arrested said that but I can name you dozens if not hundreds of others who really sort of play it straight. The characters who were arrested are far from the A-team -- very undistinguished, sort of a freshman city council member. Malcolm Smith I just described. These are guys who weren't necessarily going to light up the sky any other way.



And I haven't heard anybody yet say, Jake, that they're terribly surprised that this happened.



TAPPER: All right. Errol Louis, thank you so much.



LOUIS: Thank you.



TAPPER: Hash tag, you're it. Help out the New York tabloids. Send us your best headlines for the New York City bribery scandal. Tweet your ideas to @TheLeadCNN. Use the #headlinehelp. We'll read the best ones on air at the end of the show.



Thinking of buying a new car? You and everyone else. The U.S. auto industry is on the comeback trail and it has the recession to thank for its turnaround. Our ""Money Lead"" is next.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



TAPPER: ""The Money Lead"": It looks like Motor City has found its mojo. Detroit's big three saw a surge in auto sales last month, the biggest in almost six years. But, surprise, surprise, it's not the economy or even the better business model fueling the come back.



CNN Money correspondent Zain Asher is live in New York to explain this all to us. Zain, what's really behind these numbers? ZAIN ASHER, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Jake. Well, you know, it's a number of things.



First, we've got the record low interest rates. That's making car financing attractive. Right now, you're looking at just under 2.5 percent for a car loan compared to more than 4 percent in 2006. So, things are very cheap right now.



Also want to talk about pent-up demand. OK. So, the average American car right now is pretty old. It's roughly around 11 years old. The oldest, in fact, believe it or not, that's ever been. People are now ready to switch over to new and head to the showrooms again.



Plus, home sales, construction, and renovation activity, as that increases, you're going to see a big boost in pickup sales because that's what independent contractors tend to drive. Definitely good news for American car manufacturers -- Jake.



TAPPER: How do these numbers compare to the sales of foreign cars here in the U.S.?



ASHER: Well, it's a little all over the map. So, the big three American car companies, GM, Ford, and Chrysler, were all up between 5 percent and 6 percent. Some foreign car companies like Honda saw an even bigger increase, whereas Toyota and Nissan both had slightly slower months, only roughly around 1 percent.



It's been big a big turn-around for American car companies. They tend to focus more on pickup trucks than SUVs. They were hurt very badly during the financial crisis partly because these vehicles tend to gobble for more gas. Also, a lot of the businesses that buy pickup trucks were closing down. Now, we're seeing things slowly start to turn around.



U.S. car companies also want to mention they're trying desperately to compete with Asian cars, adding more bells and whistles. So, Ford's got the Sync system, Chevy has got a MyLink entertainment system working with smartphones to integrate music into the driving experience.



So, they're trying to compete with the Asian counterparts as well -- Jake.



TAPPER: And, Zain, how does the future look?



ASHER: Well, experts predict that 15 million cars will be sold this year. Right before the financial crisis, 16.5 million cars were sold. So, not really that far off.



Also, as the housing market improves, we're going to see a big boost in car sales especially with pickup trucks.



One problem, though, I want to mention, might be urbanization. More people moving to cities to find work that might have a slightly negative impact on car sales. Overall, though, there's a lot working in the car manufacturers' favor right now. So, the upward trend should continue -- Jake.



TAPPER: Do you have a car, Zain? Do you drive a car? Or are you one of these New Yorkers who just takes the subway everywhere?



ASHER: I used to drive a car when I was in L.A. But now, I take the subway.



TAPPER: All right.



Will she or won't she? I don't even know what I'm having for breakfast tomorrow, but everybody already expects Hillary Clinton to know what she's planning for 2016. I will ask my political panel what their five-year plan is and what they think Clinton is up to, in our 'Politics Lead."" That's coming up.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



TAPPER: Welcome back to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.



""The Politics Lead"": Nothing to see here. Just private citizen Hillary Clinton. She leaps back into the spotlight today. With the money already lining up, here come the questions about 2016.



""The World Lead"": The North Korea crisis heating up as in heating up an old nuclear reactor and the U.S. answers with a massive missile destroyer. Is the Pentagon making all the right moves?



""The Pop Lead"": I can picture it now. Clint Eastwood turning to an empty chair and asking, who the heck is Lady Gaga? Details of the RNC's big money plan to get her to perform at the convention and how they got rejected.



""The World Lead"": The situation in North Korea seems to be careening increasingly out of control by the day. The U.S. military now says that it has a second destroyer in the region after the North announced it is restarting a nuclear reactor and leaving no doubt that it plans to use that reactor to try to make nuclear weapons. The reactor is in Yongbyon. North Korea shut it down five years ago under an agreement reached in six-party talks, which included the U.S.



The country made a big show of imploding one of the cooling towers at the facility in 1998. Now, North Korea is turning it on again, giving the usual line about how it will use the facility to generate electricity, but also saying for the first time it will be used to make nuclear weapons, too.



North Korea is relaunching a number of other facilities, including ones who enrich uranium, which could also be used for nukes. This comes just a day after the U.S. decided to park a destroyer that can shoot down missiles near the Korean peninsula.



Today, the Pentagon announced that a second destroyer is now in the region.



But the White House says it is hardly shocked by the North's latest provocation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: North Korea's announcement it will reopen or restart its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon is another indication of its, you know, pattern of contradicting its own commitments and its pattern of violating its international obligation.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: The head of the United Nations sounded a lot more alarmed by the North Korea's announcement. Secretary General Ban Ki- moon, who is South Korean, says the rhetoric is already away over the line.



"	0
14	"John McCain's Acceptance Speech





By John McCain

September 5, 2008 Thank you all very much. Tonight, I have a privilege given few Americans -- the privilege of accepting our party's nomination for President of the United States. And I accept it with gratitude, humility and confidence.



In my life, no success has come without a good fight, and this nomination wasn't any different. That's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters. They're leaders of great ability, who love our country, and wished to lead it to better days. Their support is an honor I won't forget.



I'm grateful to the President for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on American soil in our history, and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable; and to the First Lady, Laura Bush, a model of grace and kindness in public and in private. And I'm grateful to the 41st President and his bride of 63 years, and for their outstanding example of honorable service to our country.







As always, I'm indebted to my wife, Cindy, and my seven children. The pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation's business. But I have treasured them all the more, and can't imagine a life without the happiness you give me. Cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight. But, in truth, she's more my inspiration than I am hers. Her concern for those less blessed than we are -- victims of land mines, children born in poverty and with birth defects -- shows the measure of her humanity. I know she will make a great First Lady.



When I was growing up, my father was often at sea, and the job of raising my brother, sister and me would fall to my mother alone. Roberta McCain gave us her love of life, her deep interest in the world, her strength, and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country. I wouldn't be here tonight but for the strength of her character.



My heartfelt thanks to all of you, who helped me win this nomination, and stood by me when the odds were long. I won't let you down. To Americans who have yet to decide who to vote for, thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust. I intend to earn it.



Finally, a word to Senator Obama and his supporters. We'll go at it over the next two months. That's the nature of these contests, and there are big differences between us. But you have my respect and admiration. Despite our differences, much more unites us than divides us. We are fellow Americans, an association that means more to me than any other. We're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights. No country ever had a greater cause than that. And I wouldn't be an American worthy of the name if I didn't honor Senator Obama and his supporters for their achievement.



But let there be no doubt, my friends, we're going to win this election. And after we've won, we're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot, make this government start working for you again, and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace.



These are tough times for many of you. You're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one, and are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home. All you ever asked of government is to stand on your side, not in your way. And that's just what I intend to do: stand on your side and fight for your future.



And I've found just the right partner to help me shake up Washington, Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska. She has executive experience and a real record of accomplishment. She's tackled tough problems like energy independence and corruption. She's balanced a budget, cut taxes, and taken on the special interests. She's reached across the aisle and asked Republicans, Democrats and Independents to serve in her administration. She's the mother of five children. She's helped run a small business, worked with her hands and knows what it's like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries.



She knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for. She stands up for what's right, and she doesn't let anyone tell her to sit down. I'm very proud to have introduced our next Vice President to the country. But I can't wait until I introduce her to Washington. And let me offer an advance warning to the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second Washington crowd: change is coming.



I'm not in the habit of breaking promises to my country and neither is Governor Palin. And when we tell you we're going to change Washington, and stop leaving our country's problems for some unluckier generation to fix, you can count on it. We've got a record of doing just that, and the strength, experience, judgment and backbone to keep our word to you.



You know, I've been called a maverick; someone who marches to the beat of his own drum. Sometimes it's meant as a compliment and sometimes it's not. What it really means is I understand who I work for. I don't work for a party. I don't work for a special interest. I don't work for myself. I work for you.



I've fought corruption, and it didn't matter if the culprits were Democrats or Republicans. They violated their public trust, and had to be held accountable. I've fought big spenders in both parties, who waste your money on things you neither need nor want, while you struggle to buy groceries, fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment. I've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections. I've fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes. I fought crooked deals in the Pentagon. I fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers, drug companies and union bosses.



I fought for the right strategy and more troops in Iraq, when it wasn't a popular thing to do. And when the pundits said my campaign was finished, I said I'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war.



Thanks to the leadership of a brilliant general, David Petreaus, and the brave men and women he has the honor to command, that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralized our military, risked a wider war and threatened the security of all Americans.



I don't mind a good fight. For reasons known only to God, I've had quite a few tough ones in my life. But I learned an important lesson along the way. In the end, it matters less that you can fight. What you fight for is the real test.



I fight for Americans. I fight for you. I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market. Bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months. Sue works three jobs to help pay the bills.



I fight for Jake and Toni Wimmer of Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Jake works on a loading dock; coaches Little League, and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled. Toni is a schoolteacher, working toward her Master's Degree. They have two sons, the youngest, Luke, has been diagnosed with autism. Their lives should matter to the people they elect to office. They matter to me.



I fight for the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfboro, New Hampshire, who died serving our country in Iraq. I wear his bracelet and think of him every day. I intend to honor their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to, remains safe from its enemies.



I fight to restore the pride and principles of our party. We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us. We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption. We lost their trust when rather than reform government, both parties made it bigger. We lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil, both parties and Senator Obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies. We lost their trust, when we valued our power over our principles.



We're going to change that. We're going to recover the people's trust by standing up again for the values Americans admire. The party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics.



We believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their God-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the Mayflower to the Latina daughter of migrant workers. We're all God's children and we're all Americans.



We believe in low taxes; spending discipline, and open markets. We believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labor.



We believe in a strong defense, work, faith, service, a culture of life, personal responsibility, the rule of law, and judges who dispense justice impartially and don't legislate from the bench. We believe in the values of families, neighborhoods and communities.



We believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of Americans. Government that doesn't make your choices for you, but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself.



I will keep taxes low and cut them where I can. My opponent will raise them. I will open new markets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them. I will cut government spending. He will increase it.



My tax cuts will create jobs. His tax increases will eliminate them. My health care plan will make it easier for more Americans to find and keep good health care insurance. His plan will force small businesses to cut jobs, reduce wages, and force families into a government run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor.



Keeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs. Cutting the second highest business tax rate in the world will help American companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas. Doubling the child tax exemption from $3500 to $7000 will improve the lives of millions of American families. Reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save, spend and invest as you see fit. Opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity.



I know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government hasn't even noticed. Government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s. That's going to change on my watch. My opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy. We're going to help workers who've lost a job that won't come back, find a new one that won't go away.



We will prepare them for the jobs of today. We will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities. For workers in industries that have been hard hit, we'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary, lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage.



Education is the civil rights issue of this century. Equal access to public education has been gained. But what is the value of access to a failing school? We need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition, empower parents with choice, remove barriers to qualified instructors, attract and reward good teachers, and help bad teachers find another line of work.



When a public school fails to meet its obligations to students, parents deserve a choice in the education of their children. And I intend to give it to them. Some may choose a better public school. Some may choose a private one. Many will choose a charter school. But they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity.



Senator Obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies. I want schools to answer to parents and students. And when I'm President, they will.



My fellow Americans, when I'm President, we're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades. We are going to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much. We will attack the problem on every front. We will produce more energy at home. We will drill new wells offshore, and we'll drill them now. We will build more nuclear power plants. We will develop clean coal technology. We will increase the use of wind, tide, solar and natural gas. We will encourage the development and use of flex fuel, hybrid and electric automobiles.



Senator Obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power. But Americans know better than that. We must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet. It's an ambitious plan, but Americans are ambitious by nature, and we have faced greater challenges. It's time for us to show the world again how Americans lead.



This great national cause will create millions of new jobs, many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity; jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce.



Today, the prospect of a better world remains within our reach. But we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them, as Americans before us did, with confidence, wisdom and resolve.



We have dealt a serious blow to al Qaeda in recent years. But they are not defeated, and they'll strike us again if they can. Iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Russia's leaders, rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power, have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power. They invaded a small, democratic neighbor to gain more control over the world's oil supply, intimidate other neighbors, and further their ambitions of reassembling the Russian empire. And the brave people of Georgia need our solidarity and prayers. As President I will work to establish good relations with Russia so we need not fear a return of the Cold War. But we can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people.



We face many threats in this dangerous world, but I'm not afraid of them. I'm prepared for them. I know how the military works, what it can do, what it can do better, and what it should not do. I know how the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't. I know how to secure the peace.



When I was five years old, a car pulled up in front of our house. A Navy officer rolled down the window, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It is terrible beyond imagination.



I'm running for President to keep the country I love safe, and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has. I will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders, and all the tools at our disposal -- diplomatic, economic, military and the power of our ideals -- to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace.



In America, we change things that need to be changed. Each generation makes its contribution to our greatness. The work that is ours to do is plainly before us. We don't need to search for it.



We need to change the way government does almost everything: from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy; from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network; from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children. All these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy, the information technology revolution and the end of the Cold War. We have to catch up to history, and we have to change the way we do business in Washington.



The constant partisan rancor that stops us from solving these problems isn't a cause, it's a symptom. It's what happens when people go to Washington to work for themselves and not you.



Again and again, I've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed. That's how I will govern as President. I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again. I have that record and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not.



Instead of rejecting good ideas because we didn't think of them first, let's use the best ideas from both sides. Instead of fighting over who gets the credit, let's try sharing it. This amazing country can do anything we put our minds to. I will ask Democrats and Independents to serve with me. And my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability.



We're going to finally start getting things done for the people who are counting on us, and I won't care who gets the credit.



I've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years. But I have been her servant first, last and always. And I've never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I didn't thank God for the privilege.



Long ago, something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life. I was blessed by misfortune. I mean that sincerely. I was blessed because I served in the company of heroes, and I witnessed a thousand acts of courage, compassion and love.



On an October morning, in the Gulf of Tonkin, I prepared for my 23rd mission over North Vietnam. I hadn't any worry I wouldn't come back safe and sound. I thought I was tougher than anyone. I was pretty independent then, too. I liked to bend a few rules, and pick a few fights for the fun of it. But I did it for my own pleasure; my own pride. I didn't think there was a cause more important than me.



Then I found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of Hanoi, with two broken arms, a broken leg, and an angry crowd waiting to greet me. I was dumped in a dark cell, and left to die. I didn't feel so tough anymore. When they discovered my father was an admiral, they took me to a hospital. They couldn't set my bones properly, so they just slapped a cast on me. When I didn't get better, and was down to about a hundred pounds, they put me in a cell with two other Americans. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't even feed myself. They did it for me. I was beginning to learn the limits of my selfish independence. Those men saved my life.



I was in solitary confinement when my captors offered to release me. I knew why. If I went home, they would use it as propaganda to demoralize my fellow prisoners. Our Code said we could only go home in the order of our capture, and there were men who had been shot down before me. I thought about it, though. I wasn't in great shape, and I missed everything about America. But I turned it down.



A lot of prisoners had it worse than I did. I'd been mistreated before, but not as badly as others. I always liked to strut a little after I'd been roughed up to show the other guys I was tough enough to take it. But after I turned down their offer, they worked me over harder than they ever had before. For a long time. And they broke me.



When they brought me back to my cell, I was hurt and ashamed, and I didn't know how I could face my fellow prisoners. The good man in the cell next door, my friend, Bob Craner, saved me. Through taps on a wall he told me I had fought as hard as I could. No man can always stand alone. And then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men I had the honor to serve with. Because every day they fought for me.



I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's. I loved it not just for the many comforts of life here. I loved it for its decency; for its faith in the wisdom, justice and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again. I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's.



I'm not running for president because I think I'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need. My country saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it. And I will fight for her for as long as I draw breath, so help me God.



If you find faults with our country, make it a better one. If you're disappointed with the mistakes of government, join its ranks and work to correct them. Enlist in our Armed Forces. Become a teacher. Enter the ministry. Run for public office. Feed a hungry child. Teach an illiterate adult to read. Comfort the afflicted. Defend the rights of the oppressed. Our country will be the better, and you will be the happier. Because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself.



I'm going to fight for my cause every day as your President. I'm going to fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God, as I thank Him: that I'm an American, a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth, and with hard work, strong faith and a little courage, great things are always within our reach. Fight with me. Fight with me.



Fight for what's right for our country.



Fight for the ideals and character of a free people.



Fight for our children's future.



Fight for justice and opportunity for all.



Stand up to defend our country from its enemies.



Stand up for each other; for beautiful, blessed, bountiful America.



Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight. Nothing is inevitable here. We're Americans, and we never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history.



Thank you, and God Bless you."	0

AMANPOUR (voice-over): Welcome to viewers here and around the world. I'm Christiane Amanpour.

And at the top of the news this week: nuclear secret, a report of a major advance in North Korea's nuclear program. What new threat does it pose? And how will it impact the president's disarmament agenda and his push to get the Senate to ratify his START nuclear treaty?

OBAMA: This is not about politics. It's about national security.

AMANPOUR: This morning, the nation's top military official, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen. Plus, the escalating war in Afghanistan. His views on night raids, relations with President Karzai, and deadlines for U.S. withdrawal.

Then, hot zone. As Haiti reels from a cholera outbreak, we ask, what happened to the global pledge to rebuild the nation?

And G.M.'s new start. Was the bailout good for America after all? Analysis on our roundtable with George Will, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, and former Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich.

Plus, the Sunday funnies.

LETTERMAN: The Capitol Hill Christmas tree arrives this week. And as soon as it gets to Washington, it will die in committee. Did you know that?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation's capital, ABC's ""This Week"" with Christiane Amanpour starts now.

AMANPOUR: Hello again. And with reports of a new nuclear facility in North Korea and a new deadline in the Afghanistan war, there's a lot to discuss with our guest, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen.

President Obama returned late last night from the NATO summit in Lisbon where the United States and its allies are now talking about another deadline, the end of 2014 to hand over combat operations to Afghan forces. To make that happen, American and NATO forces are escalating the war right now, and so we start with a powerful report from ABC's Mike Boettcher in Afghanistan.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BOETTCHER (voice-over): When Lieutenant Colonel Steve Lutsky last saw 10-year-old Sadekela (ph), he was bleeding to death on the side of a road.

LUTSKY: His mom was yelling out that, ""My son is dead. My son is dead.""

BOETTCHER: Now he is recovering at a U.S. military hospital. The lives of the American officer and the Afghan boy intersected on this stretch of highway in Khost province, when a car bomber trying to kill Lutsky and his men attacked their column.

(on-screen): The American convoy was traveling this direction. The other way, civilian vehicles. They slowed down when the convoy passed. So did a suicide bomber. And inside his car, he had 600 pounds of high explosives.

(voice-over): The soldiers were not hurt, but the explosion killed one child and injured three others, including Sadekela (ph). Now angry at the Taliban, Sadekela's (ph) family is grateful to the Americans for saving his life, a small but important victory in a war where not killing civilians is more important than killing the enemy.

TOWNSEND: It buys us credit, in the sense that there's a little more respect for us and there's a little more trust for us.

BOETTCHER: America's top officers tell Afghans that it's the Taliban who are killing civilians, a message undermined by President Karzai's claims that U.S. special operations night raids are killing innocent people.

(UNKNOWN): Nine out of 10 civilian casualties are caused by the Taliban.

BOETTCHER: At a district center in eastern Afghanistan, not everyone is convinced by that argument. During a visit by the 101st Airborne's deputy commander in Afghanistan, Steve Townsend (ph), a village elder asserted that the Americans were killing more Afghans than the Soviets did a quarter century ago. Townsend pushed back hard.

(UNKNOWN): Look in my eyes right now. You know I'm telling the truth.

BOETTCHER: But as the words fly, so do bombs and bullets. Combat Outpost Firra (ph), situated on the Pakistan border, is often attacked. During one assault, 18 insurgents died, but soldiers know this: You can't kill your way out of Afghanistan.

(UNKNOWN): They can reconstitute faster than we can. We're so close to Pakistan that they just come right across the border.

BOETTCHER: So rather than enemy body counts, real success here is measured in how quickly Afghan feet can fill American-made boots. If the war is to end, Afghan soldiers will have to end it.

(UNKNOWN): We have to make a difference. Coming here and -- and just running around and killing the enemy and then leaving and looking back and saying, ""I didn't make a difference, I didn't make a change,"" will cause us to never leave.

BOETTCHER: Steve Lutsky's son is the same age as young Sadekela (ph), 10. The colonel wants only one thing to come from his service here: confidence that his own son someday will not be fighting his father's war.

For ""This Week,"" Mike Boettcher, ABC News, Forward Operating Base Clark, Afghanistan.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: And joining me now is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen.

Welcome to ""This Week.""

MULLEN: Good morning.

AMANPOUR: And we will discuss, of course, Afghanistan, but let me get to the breaking news this morning, the report by the New York Times of the discovery of a new nuclear facility in North Korea. How much of a threat is that to the United States, to the world?

MULLEN: Well, this validates a long-standing concern that we've had with respect to North Korea and -- and its enrichment of uranium. It also continues to validate a country that is led by a dictator who is constantly -- who constantly desires to destabilize the region. And he's done that again, certainly, with this capability, as well."	0
16	"Transcript below:



MIKA BRZEZINSKI: With us now Republican Representative from Indiana and Chairman of the House Republican Conference, Congressman Mike Pence. He's also Chairman of the American Energy Solutions Group which will introduce the House GOP's answer to the nation's energy problem in a bill later today. Morning Joe has an exclusive look at the details.



JOE SCARBOROUGH: I want to ask him a question.



BRZEZINSKI: Okay, fine.



SCARBOROUGH: I laughed this morning when I heard the President talking about fiscal responsibility. I support PAYGO and I'm sure you support PAYGO but as Dylan Ratigan said, ""the cow is already out of the barn.""



REP. MIKE PENCE: Well, that's right, Joe. I really do believe there is a little bit of symmetry here between the issue of PAYGO and the energy legislation that Republicans are going to be introducing today. What the Democrats have and are planning to bring to the floor this month is essentially a national energy tax. This so-called ""cap and trade bill"" is a means of paying for all of the runaway federal spending that we've seen under the last Administration and redoubled and increased.



SCARBOROUGH: Can you explain that because we hear about cap in trade. Break it down for us as simply as you can. What does that mean for americans and their energy problem?



REP. PENCE: What it means all in the name of climate change this new regime of limiting carbon emissions from all different sources of energy production in this country but i don't think you need to look any further than the President himself, Joe, who literally said his cap and trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, ""necessarily skyrocket"". John Dingle of Michigan and the Commerce Committee said people don't realize this is a tax and a, ""great big one."" Republicans today are going to unveil a plan that takes us in the direction of energy independence.



SCARBOROUGH: Trying to break this down. So where people would mainly feel it is in their power bills every week?



REP. PENCE: Places like Indiana where I'm from would see a potential doubling of their utility rates but also, remember; the cost of energy goes into virtually every product we consume. This national energy tax according to some estimates could mean additional energy costs across the board of some $3,000 or more per year per household. We have a better way. We have a better solution. We're going to unveil it this morning. I'm glad to do so exclusively here on Morning Joe. The Republicans' all-of-the-above strategy, we're going to say yes to giving the American people more access to American oil, more domestic exploration for natural gas and coal, yes to renewables like wind and solar and we're going to say a deafening yes to nuclear energy. We're going to commit this country or call on this country to build 100 new nuclear power plants in the next 20 years.



SCARBOROUGH: Your alternative energy source, obviously we're not there yet. The federal government may need to step in and get involved in helping the private sector.



REP. PENCE: It really does, Joe. We want to capture some of the revenues from offshore drilling and put it into a renewable trust fund that will be available in the development of alternative and renewable sources of energy. We just don't need to pass legislation like cap in trade that will amount to a national energy tax, harm our economy at a time, quite frankly, when every American small business is struggling to make ends meet. There's a better way. Republicans will outline that today and I have a feeling - I just have a gut feeling there's a lot of concern even among many Democrats on capitol hill about the national energy tax looking for a better solution and I believe the American Energy Act we introduce today will be part of that.



SCARBOROUGH: I think you're exactly right. A lot of Democrats are concerned. a lot of Republicans I know are concerned about the way we use energy in this country. I mean, do you agree with me and a lot of conservatives that there's nothing conservative about a country that has 4% of the world's population spending 25% of the world's energy?



REP. PENCE: Percentages I don't get as concerned about as the notion that appears. Joe, you served on the house floor with great distinction. Remember the quote up on the wall by Daniel Webster that speaks about the resources of this country, the natural resources of this country, the genius of this country. He said let us call forth this nation's power. Part of that power is innovation. Part of that power is finding alternative sources of energy like wind, energy and solar. Oil and coal, natural gas and clean coal technologies. We just don't need to pass the Democrat cap in trade plan, to answer with innovation and alternatives. That's the Republican solution.



SCARBOROUGH: Teddy Roosevelt, of course, also talked a lot about conservation.



REP. PENCE: That's right.



SCARBOROUGH: That's something we can do right now.



REP. PENCE: That's right.



SCARBOROUGH: Is that part of your package, too?



REP. PENCE: That's exactly right. You're one of my favorite Teddy Roosevelt Republicans, Joe, and we're going to make a real commitment to conservation in this legislation but, remember, the national energy tax is all about paying for all this spending. People should see it as no other way. They want to pass a national energy tax so you pay and they go on spending. That's the real PAYGO. Republicans have a better solution and we're looking forward to showing it to the American people.



SCARBOROUGH: Thank you for coming here and talking to us about it first, Congressman Pence. Thank you so much."	0
17	"You have probably heard the news about Trey GowdyÃ¢ÂÂs son that he has disappeared. Well, as we said that we will keep you updated with this story, itÃ¢ÂÂs time to tell you that Terrence Vaughan Martin Gowdy, the 8-year-old son of Try, was found dead in a dumpster in DC.

Well, it seems that the dumpster belong to the new Trump Hotel, which only indicates that either the murderers are trying to frame to our President, or they want to send a message to him and his family. Little Terrence disappeared earlier today from the Capitol building, and didnÃ¢ÂÂt manage to make it fat before his young life was shut by forces of globalist.

Congressman Trey Gowdy and his family did not come up with a statement. They ask for privacy and they are taking some family time in order to deal with the tragic loss of their son. His family and he, are at a high-security safehouse in an unknown location, so they can protect themselves.

We also found out that there are two suspects in the murder, Sanjay Gemtrapa and Hamil Lalahafa and they are being question. David Morrisey, an US attorney is in charge of the case. We will have more information as they come in!"	1
18	"An offer to participate in an online survey to get free Delta Airline tickets is a scam.

""Congratulations! You have been selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Delta Airline Tickets! We only have 332 Tickets remaining so hurry up!"" states the website Delta-Flying.info.

After we started our fact-check, the link was no longer in use and had been flagged as suspected phishing. It is not an official Delta website.

Such hoaxes that Delta or other airlines, including Southwest Airlines, have been giving away free tickets have circulated for years.

DonÃ¢ÂÂt take the surveys Ã¢ÂÂ these are all scams.

Graham Cluley, a security analyst, has previously written about the repercussions of the Southwest scam in 2016:

""The end result of all these shenanigans, of course, is to trick Facebook users into poor decisions Ã¢ÂÂ whether it be taking online surveys which earn affiliate cash for the scammers, signing up for expensive premium rate mobile services, or spamming the unwary with unwanted (and sometimes malicious) messages. .... If you are ever in any doubt as to whether a special offer on Facebook is genuine or not, visit the companyÃ¢ÂÂs real website to see if they mention the competition there Ã¢ÂÂ or whether they are warning of a scam.""

Delta spokeswoman Kate Modolo pointed to this page on Delta.com where legitimate offers from the airline are located.

The story that said Delta Airlines offers free airline tickets for people who take a short survey is a scam. We rate this story Pants on Fire."	1

21	"The department is now reviewing some 55,000 pages of emails. A first batch of 3,000 pages was made public on June 30.

In the course of the email review, State Department officials determined that some information in the messages should be retroactively classified. In the 3,000 pages that were released, for example, portions of two dozen emails were redacted because they were upgraded to Ã¢ÂÂclassified status.Ã¢ÂÂ But none of those were marked as classified at the time Mrs. Clinton handled them.

In a second memo to Mr. Kennedy, sent on July 17, the inspectors general said that at least one email made public by the State Department contained classified information. The inspectors general did not identify the email or reveal its substance.

The memos were provided to The New York Times by a senior government official.

The inspectors general also criticized the State Department for its handling of sensitive information, particularly its reliance on retired senior Foreign Service officers to decide if information should be classified, and for not consulting with the intelligence agencies about its determinations.

In March, Mrs. Clinton insisted that she was careful in her handling of information on her private account. Ã¢ÂÂI did not email any classified material to anyone on my email,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂThere is no classified material. So IÃ¢ÂÂm certainly well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.Ã¢ÂÂ"	0

11:27 A.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all for being here today. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a great honor for you to share your personal stories of struggle under the enormous strain imposed on you by the very, very failed and failing Obamacare law. Secretary Price and I, along with my entire administration, and a lot of people in the Senate and a lot of people in the House are committed to repealing and replacing this disastrous law with a healthcare plan that lowers cost, expands choice, and ensures access for everyone.

You represent the millions of Americans who have seen their Obamacare premiums increase by double digits and even triple digits. In Arizona, the rates were over 116 percent last year -- 116 percent increase. And the deductibles are so high you donÃ¢ÂÂt even get to use it.

Many Americans lost their plans and doctors altogether, and one-third of the counties -- think of it, one-third only have one insurer left. The insurance companies are fleeing. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre gone; so many gone. The House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare will provide you and your fellow citizens with more choices -- far more choices at lower cost. Americans should pick the plan they want. Now theyÃ¢ÂÂll be able to pick the plan they want, theyÃ¢ÂÂll be able to pick the doctor they want. TheyÃ¢ÂÂll be able to do a lot of things that the other plan was supposed to give and it never gave. You donÃ¢ÂÂt pick your doctor, you donÃ¢ÂÂt pick your plan -- you remember that one.

WeÃ¢ÂÂre not going to have one-size-fits-all. Instead, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be working to unleash the power of the private marketplace to let insurers come in and compete for your business. And youÃ¢ÂÂll see rates go down, down, down, and youÃ¢ÂÂll see plans go up, up, up. YouÃ¢ÂÂll have a lot of choices.

YouÃ¢ÂÂll have plans that nobody is even thinking of today. They will have plans that today nobody has even thought about, because the market is going to enforce that, with millions and millions of people wanting healthcare. More competition and less regulation will finally bring down the cost of care, and I think it will bring it down very significantly. Unfortunately, it takes a while to get there, because you have to let that marketplace kick in, and itÃ¢ÂÂs going to take a little while to get there. Once it does, itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a thing of beauty. I wish it didnÃ¢ÂÂt take a year or two years, but thatÃ¢ÂÂs whatÃ¢ÂÂs going to happen, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the way it works. But weÃ¢ÂÂre willing to go through that process.

Working together, weÃ¢ÂÂll get the job done. And I have to say this just in closing, and then I want to hear some of your stories, and weÃ¢ÂÂll let the press stay for your stories if you like. But the press is making Obamacare look so good all of a sudden. IÃ¢ÂÂm watching the news -- looks so good. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre showing these reports about ""this one gets so much and this one gets so much.""

First of all, it covers very few people. And itÃ¢ÂÂs imploding. And Ã¢ÂÂ17 will be the worst year. And I said it once, IÃ¢ÂÂll say it again -- because Obama is gone -- things are going to be very bad this year for the people with Obamacare. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre going to have tremendous increases.

And the Republicans, frankly, are putting themselves in a very bad position -- and I tell this to Tom Price all the time -- by repealing Obamacare -- because people arenÃ¢ÂÂt going to see the truly devastating effects of Obamacare. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre not going to see the devastation in Ã¢ÂÂ17 and Ã¢ÂÂ18 and Ã¢ÂÂ19. It'll be gone by then, whether we do it or not. ItÃ¢ÂÂll be imploded off the map.

So the press is making it look so wonderful so that if we end it, everyone is going to say, ""Oh, remember how great Obamacare used to be, remember how wonderful it used to be, it was so great."" ItÃ¢ÂÂs a little bit like President Obama. When he left, people liked him. When he was here, people didnÃ¢ÂÂt like him so much. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the way life goes. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs human nature.

The fact is, Obamacare is a disaster. And I say this to the Republicans all the time: By repealing it, by getting rid of it, by ending it, everyone is going to say, ""Oh, it used to be so great."" But it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt great. And I tell Tom Price and I tell Paul Ryan, I tell everyone of them -- I say, the best thing you can do politically is wait a year, because itÃ¢ÂÂs going to blow itself off the map. But thatÃ¢ÂÂs the wrong thing to do for the country, itÃ¢ÂÂs the wrong thing to do for our citizens.

So with that, IÃ¢ÂÂd like to introduce some of the folks and you could say a few words about your experience with Obamacare. And perhaps the press will even report it. (Laughter.)

Would you like to start?

MS. COUEY: Yeah, thank you for this opportunity, Mr. President.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.

MS. COUEY: Our rates are three times what they were before Obamacare started. We have one provider in our county. We have very little options for what we can and cannot do. WeÃ¢ÂÂre a small-business owner; weÃ¢ÂÂre actually not a brick-and-mortar, we are cattle ranchers. We canÃ¢ÂÂt afford our equipment if weÃ¢ÂÂre paying these rates year after year after year.

Our food source is in jeopardy because of this healthcare law. ItÃ¢ÂÂs my basic --

THE PRESIDENT: I know. Sorry. Don't worry. Don't worry. This is whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening. ItÃ¢ÂÂs gone up three times, and then you have to pay -- if you donÃ¢ÂÂt want to use it, you have to pay. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the all-time beauty. If you donÃ¢ÂÂt want to use it, you have to pay. And, Tom, you have to pay big league, right? Some people say, well, if I use it, I use it, IÃ¢ÂÂm paying too much. If I donÃ¢ÂÂt use it, I have to pay a penalty. And do you have to pay penalties? Do you ever do that, or you have to --

MS. COUEY: We havenÃ¢ÂÂt as of yet, but we were uninsured in December. They dropped us for the fourth time, after we paid over $50,000 last year for healthcare expenses.

THE PRESIDENT: And itÃ¢ÂÂs gone up triple.

MS. COUEY: Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: And before Obamacare, you actually had good healthcare.

MS. COUEY: We did. We had a fantastic plan.

THE PRESIDENT: A lot of people -- nobody ever takes that into account. IÃ¢ÂÂm not saying the system before was good, because it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt, but millions of people had great healthcare that they loved.

Now, when you start deducting those millions of people from the so-called people that are happy, you have a very small number of people that are happy. That, I can tell you.

How about you?

PARTICIPANT: Well, weÃ¢ÂÂre kind of the same story as Carrie. In 2009, I left a full-time job to be a stay-at-home mom to two kids. For our family, it was never an option to get government assistance; we just donÃ¢ÂÂt believe our neighbors should work harder so that we donÃ¢ÂÂt have to. So my husband said, if you can pay for our insurance -- which at the time was $650 a month for private health insurance for a family of four -- then that was fine.

From 2009 to 2015, that private insurance went up by 102 percent. Finally, his employer told us in 2015, when it went up the final time an additional 34 percent, that they couldnÃ¢ÂÂt carry our family anymore, so I had to enter back into the workforce but I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt find a job that offered health insurance. So we entered under Obamacare, and we believed the sales pitch that, ""If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.""

So even though we were going to have to pay $1,300 a month for Obamacare, we thought weÃ¢ÂÂd still be okay with our doctors. We were on it for five months. Our pediatrician for our children wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt take it, my doctor wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt take it, so we paid them $8,000 in five months and were never able to use it.

And I think what makes our family story unique is, weÃ¢ÂÂre by no means wealthy. In 2014, when we entered the exchange, we made $53,000 as a family, my husband and I together -- that was our gross income. And then in 2015, we made together -- since I had gone back to work -- $74,000. But when you look at paying $10,000 in health premiums and insurance -- and health costs --

THE PRESIDENT: So itÃ¢ÂÂs been a rough go.

PARTICIPANT: It has, itÃ¢ÂÂs been hard.

THE PRESIDENT: How have you found Obamacare?

PARTICIPANT: WeÃ¢ÂÂll be so happy to see it gone. I mean, itÃ¢ÂÂs almost put our family in financial ruin, and I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs the story for a lot of people.

THE PRESIDENT: ItÃ¢ÂÂs put businesses in financial ruin.

PARTICIPANT: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs right.

THE PRESIDENT: ItÃ¢ÂÂs one of the biggest costs -- it has been disastrous for businesses.

Go ahead, sir.

MR. SEIFE: Yes, first of all, Mr. President, thank you for having us here.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.

MR. SEIFE: I think itÃ¢ÂÂs a great opportunity to talk to the American people, people like ourselves that have struggled with the healthcare law.

I myself am from Miami. I havenÃ¢ÂÂt had very much time to prepare, but the President of the United States calls and IÃ¢ÂÂm here. (Laughter.) So it just so happened I had -- every single year for the past couple of years IÃ¢ÂÂve had a different insurance every single year. Before, I had an individual plan, my wife and I -- my wife is an attorney, IÃ¢ÂÂm a computer programmer; IÃ¢ÂÂm a small business, my wife is a small business. And I just donÃ¢ÂÂt understand what happened. I have a daughter with a disability. WeÃ¢ÂÂve changed our plan every year.

THE PRESIDENT: So your insurance was good before Obamacare.

MR. SEIFE: Oh, absolutely. I never had --

THE PRESIDENT: Many people are like that. Many, many plans were great before Obamacare. They were so happy. And that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt justify the system before Obamacare, but people are miserable now, and itÃ¢ÂÂs putting people out of business and itÃ¢ÂÂs putting them in the poorhouse.

Go ahead.

MR. SEIFE: ItÃ¢ÂÂs just that we had to -- they cancelled our plans, and I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt understand why they cancelled our plans. So we had no other choice. I remember the President of the United States say that individual plans will not be covered, you need to have an employer-based plan. I do not work for the government, I do not work for a large employer.

THE PRESIDENT: Very unfair.

MR. SEIFE: We are ground zero. My case is ground zero for the healthcare law.

THE PRESIDENT: And you represent a lot of people in the same situation.

MR. SEIFE: Absolutely.

THE PRESIDENT: ItÃ¢ÂÂs very unfair.

MR. SEIFE: Like my friend here, sheÃ¢ÂÂs in the same situation. And I think itÃ¢ÂÂs very, very unfair. And I think that the real scenario was that this law was supposed to implode, like you were saying. And my parents are from -- came from communist Cuba, they know what socialism is all about. So I know what socialism is, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs pretty much what -- this whole system was meant to have one single provider.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, it turns out it's so expensive itÃ¢ÂÂs almost not socialism when you think about it. (Laughter.) You have to pay so much.

What do you think? Go ahead.

MS. SERTICH: IÃ¢ÂÂm from Arizona, and I can tell you that the 116-percent increase is real, itÃ¢ÂÂs not a myth. I lost my plan three times during the Obamacare era. After losing it this year I decided to opt out. So right now I do not have traditional healthcare.

And I went from a $365-a-month premium last year to a $809-premium this year.

THE PRESIDENT: And a higher deductible.

MS. SERTICH: The deductible was going to be $6,800, no copays. So if I went to the doctor, I would be paying out of my pocket, and it just didnÃ¢ÂÂt seem like a good use of my money. I thought I would be a better steward of that $17,000 at the end of the year should I have reached my deductible, and just decided to opt out. I went into a faith-based share program, and IÃ¢ÂÂm doing that.

One of the reasons I felt like I can do this -- totally taking a leap of faith -- is because I think -- I know youÃ¢ÂÂre going to get this taken care of. So I thought itÃ¢ÂÂs only going to be for a year. I will be on this program, I will opt out of traditional healthcare, or health insurance. And I think youÃ¢ÂÂre going to get it done.

THE PRESIDENT: You have a lot of people in Arizona paying a big penalty?

MS. SERTICH: Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: YouÃ¢ÂÂre paying the penalty?

MS. SERTICH: Well, and my husband also owns his own business and canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to offer insurance to employees. And his employees who are also in the independent market, itÃ¢ÂÂs just getting too much. And IÃ¢ÂÂve had individual insurance for 25 years, since I started my business. So IÃ¢ÂÂve always been in that individual market, IÃ¢ÂÂve always done what was right. I took responsibility for myself, made sure I was covered for healthcare because IÃ¢ÂÂm a businessperson, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want any huge healthcare expenses to affect the money that could be going to my business now having to go to a health expense.

So I was in my mid-20s when I said, you know what, IÃ¢ÂÂve got to get -- weÃ¢ÂÂve got to get square with this, I have to have independent insurance. So, I have.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. The people of Arizona have been hit very, very hard. At least 116 percent. HereÃ¢ÂÂs the bad news: ItÃ¢ÂÂs going to go up more this year. Now, if we repeal it, nobody is going to know that, and the press is going to say how wonderful it was, and, gee, we miss Obamacare. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the problem. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the biggest problem I have, Tom. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to do them a big favor, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not the right way.

Go ahead.

MR. BROWN: Mr. President, thank you.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Louis.

MR. BROWN: My name is Louis Brown. I work for the Christ Medicus Foundation. I'm an attorney by trade. In 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was going through Congress -- what became the Affordable Care Act -- I was working for the Democratic National Committee at the time. I resigned my position because I could tell that the Democratic bill that was going through Congress wanted to publicly fund abortion, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs not something that I could go along with. So I resigned my position, later worked for Congressman Dan Lungren in Congress, and went on to eventually work for the Christ Medicus Foundation. And weÃ¢ÂÂre focused on building a culture of life, protecting religious liberty in healthcare, protecting the right of conscience, prohibiting the public funding of abortion, and also prohibiting non-discrimination against pro-life medical providers.

Especially as an African American, I'm a graduate of Howard University School of Law.

THE PRESIDENT: Good school.

MR. BROWN: Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. And I know from Saint John Paul II -- he said that all of our human and civil rights that we believe in as Americans, that we share as Americans -- the right to healthcare, the right to medical care, to housing, to all of these different things -- are illusory if the right to life isnÃ¢ÂÂt defended with maximum determination.

Seventeen million African Americans, itÃ¢ÂÂs shown, that probably have been aborted since Roe v. Wade. And I supported you in the presidential election, gave several speeches in Michigan telling folks to vote pro-life in the general election, and IÃ¢ÂÂm really happy that youÃ¢ÂÂre here to continue the bipartisan belief that there should be no taxpayer-funding of abortion, and also really to support your effort to show that the patient, the human person, should be at the center of our American healthcare system, not the government. The government has its place, but the patient should be the center. So IÃ¢ÂÂm happy to support you, Mr. President.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs so nice. Thank you, I appreciate it. Great job.

Yes, go ahead.

DR. SETHI: Mr. President, thank you so much for inviting me. My name is Dr. Manny, and I run a nonprofit called Healthy Tennessee, and across Tennessee IÃ¢ÂÂm a trauma surgeon. But what we do is --

THE PRESIDENT: IÃ¢ÂÂll be in Tennessee on Wednesday.

DR. MANNY: We look forward to hosting you, sir.

THE PRESIDENT: IÃ¢ÂÂll see you there.

DR. MANNY: Yes, sir. We do these large community events in rural Appalachia, across Tennessee, where we host these health fairs taking care of patients. So itÃ¢ÂÂs really a grassroots effort -- something that you understand better than anybody -- where people come out just to help people. Doctors, nurses on the ground, helping folks with preventative medicine, educating folks. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we do.

But the one thing IÃ¢ÂÂve been seeing across Tennessee is that folks really canÃ¢ÂÂt afford these rising premiums. So what theyÃ¢ÂÂre doing is, effectively, theyÃ¢ÂÂre paying the tax penalty because itÃ¢ÂÂs cheaper and it works out better than paying for the insurance. And so thatÃ¢ÂÂs been a big problem that weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing across the state. So thank you so much for what youÃ¢ÂÂre doing to tackle this problem.

THE PRESIDENT: So youÃ¢ÂÂve seen a big problem, and the way out of the problem is to do a plan much more like the plan weÃ¢ÂÂre going to get done.

DR. MANNY: Yes, sir.

THE PRESIDENT: WeÃ¢ÂÂll get that out -- without penalties too, by the way. People donÃ¢ÂÂt mention all of the facts.

You know, the other thing about what weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about -- we really have a three-phase plan. They only want to talk about the first phase. The first phase is just the most basic of phases, and then you have phase two, which is largely done by our Secretary, and then you have phase three, which is a lot of the bells and whistles. But they donÃ¢ÂÂt want to talk about the bells and whistles. So theyÃ¢ÂÂre really comparing things to something that wonÃ¢ÂÂt be there for long.

And the reason we have to do it that way is because of Congress. IÃ¢ÂÂd love to do it all in one package, but if you did it that way, it canÃ¢ÂÂt get done. So weÃ¢ÂÂre going to get something done thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be terrific.

I appreciate it. Thank you, doctor, very much.

Yes, sir. Go ahead.

MR. BROWN: Thank you, Mr. President. IÃ¢ÂÂd like to thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I, too, am from Tennessee, and I, too, am in the farming industry.

THE PRESIDENT: Good.

MR. BROWN: And the effect that IÃ¢ÂÂve had through Obamacare is my wife's and my daughter's insurance is supplied through her work, I buy my own. And IÃ¢ÂÂve seen the increases, since Obamacare, to the tune of about $5,000 a year, just for me. And I have considered taking the option of the penalty because -- my problem with the penalty is, though, if I opt out of the program, and buy a private plan -- just a catastrophic plan because IÃ¢ÂÂm a very healthy man -- if I take that option, not only is my income penalized, but my wifeÃ¢ÂÂs income as well, because she makes a considerable more amount of money than I do, but she has insurance. So I donÃ¢ÂÂt think thatÃ¢ÂÂs fair.

And I donÃ¢ÂÂt think -- the rate increase is just astronomical, and IÃ¢ÂÂm in the county that only has one option -- BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee --and IÃ¢ÂÂve got about $540-a-month premium for the $7,000 out-of-pocket deductible before I see any help at all. And I even got to pay a high premium for a plan that I donÃ¢ÂÂt need or donÃ¢ÂÂt want --

THE PRESIDENT: Will you be able to continue, in the years to come, if you have to keep going like this?

MR. BROWN: TheyÃ¢ÂÂre dropping out every day -- the suppliers in other counties. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs 35 counties in Tennessee that has no options at all right now. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know what those folks do.

THE PRESIDENT: You know what that means? That means somebody is going to make a lot of money. You know that. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre going to make a lot of money. (Laughter.) Somebody is going to -- well, a few. YouÃ¢ÂÂre not going to make it. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre going to make it. There are people very happy about this situation.

MR. BROWN: Thank you for the opportunity to be here.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I appreciate. Thank you, Joel.

Doctor?

DR. ARMSTRONG: Yes, sir. Well, IÃ¢ÂÂm a physician in Texas, and thank you for allowing me to be here today. And IÃ¢ÂÂll tell you, what IÃ¢ÂÂve seen is that a lot of patients really are not adequately covered by Obamacare. It was supposed to cover people who had -- like everyone has said here -- with the rising premiums and the rising deductibles. I take care of patients in the hospital, and the patients are shocked to get a $20,000 bill, and to find that theyÃ¢ÂÂre responsible for $6,000 of that because their deductible is so high. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs just the situation that cannot continue.

Medicaid expansion under Obamacare really doesnÃ¢ÂÂt cover folks either, because many physicians are not even taking Medicare. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre not accepting it any longer in the outpatient setting. And so folks who have chronic medical illnesses, like cancer -- I mean, my wife is a breast cancer survivor, and most of her treatment was actually as an outpatient. It was very expensive outpatient care. Most physicians donÃ¢ÂÂt even accept Medicaid, so those patients are still uncovered.

And so the Medicaid expansion really hasnÃ¢ÂÂt covered them. The folks who have Obamacare insurance really are inadequately covered as well because theyÃ¢ÂÂre still paying extremely high premiums and then having to pay extremely high deductibles. And so itÃ¢ÂÂs really --

THE PRESIDENT: And do they even reach it with the high deductibles? They donÃ¢ÂÂt even reach it for the most part.

DR. ARMSTRONG: You know, oftentimes they do not, unless they have some sort of serious medical problem, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre in the hospital, and itÃ¢ÂÂs very expensive -- they donÃ¢ÂÂt even reach their deductible oftentimes. And so itÃ¢ÂÂs unfortunate. So I really appreciate it.

I actually read the bill thatÃ¢ÂÂs been produced thatÃ¢ÂÂs coming out of the House now, and I really like a lot of the changes in it. I think that this is going to correct a lot of the issues that Obamacare has had. So I really appreciate what you all are doing.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I appreciate it, doctor. Thank you. Say hello to your wife.

DR. ARMSTRONG: Yes, sir. I will. Thank you.

THE PRESIDENT: Very nice. Thank you.

Gina.

MS. SELL: Hi, Mr. President, IÃ¢ÂÂm Gina. IÃ¢ÂÂm from Wisconsin. IÃ¢ÂÂm a nurse, IÃ¢ÂÂm a mom, and I am part of that huge group of middle-class families that were impacted by the ACA.

Before ACA, we had insurance that was eventually cancelled, and I had written a letter to our senator just asking him, what do I do? Do I quit my job completely so that we can obtain a subsidy -- a job that I love, as a nurse in a hospital that I love? Or do I uproot my family and try to find a job with benefits that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt even cover the medical --

THE PRESIDENT: So the healthcare is -- the Obamacare forced you to actually -- in a sense, forces you, economically and almost potentially, to get another job.

MS. SELL: Right.

THE PRESIDENT: Even though you like your job.

MS. SELL: Right. So I did end up getting a full-time position at the hospital that I worked at. But that came with a price because I was working three days a week, and spending time with my small children, who are my number-one priority. And after the ACA, I was forced -- because we could not afford a premium of $1,200 per month and a deductible that didnÃ¢ÂÂt cover anything -- to find a job with benefits.

THE PRESIDENT: Meaning the deductible was so high that, essentially, unless you had a really big problem, you wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt even be able to use it.

The deductible was so high that essentially unless you had a really big problem, you wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt even be able to use it.

MS. SELL: Correct, yes. And we're still in that boat. I mean, right now our deductible is $6,500. And so if I have a child who's extremely sick, it's going to cost me hundreds of dollars. Just last week, my daughter had a fever, and I sent her to school for three days straight because I had to work to afford our assurance, and I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt afford to bring her to the doctor. So it has been devastating for our family.

THE PRESIDENT: It's really not having insurance at all. A lot of Obamacare, you donÃ¢ÂÂt really have insurance because the deductibles are so high that you really donÃ¢ÂÂt have insurance, if you think about it.

All right. Thank you very much. Good luck.

MS. SELL: Thank you.

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, sir.

MR. KNOX: Mr. President, thank you very much for hosting us. This is great. I have to start with something. As I was leaving the house, my 11-year-old ran up to me and said, ""Dad, I'd like to have you give this to Mr. President for me."" (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: What do you have there? I wished I looked that good. (Laughter.)

MR. KNOX: ""Dear President Trump, it is a great honor to be able to write to the President of the USA. I think you are a great President and a great man. Also, don't worry, the picture of you on the front of this looks nothing like you."" (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: (Laughter.) That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you. I wish I looked that good.

MR. KNOX: So I had the privilege of meeting with Secretary Price and Vice President Pence in Cincinnati about a week and a half ago at a roundtable, and I'll share with you what I shared with them. I started with a quote from the great President, Ronald Reagan, who said, ""The most terrifying words in the English language are we're from the government and we're here to help.'"" (Laughter.) Kind of my feeling on healthcare.

Frankly, I think that the system was broken before the last administration got their hands on it. I started my company 21 years ago, and I had a vision of wanting to provide 100 percent full family healthcare for as long as I had a company, because I really felt in my heart that it was the right thing to do. I was one of the last holdouts. But, sadly, after about 15 years, I really had a choice of either having a company or being able to provide my employees that level of healthcare. And that's sad. I tell my wife all the time -- you can have anything you want, we just can't everything we want. We have the best healthcare system in the world -- we do -- but it needs to be fixed -- whether it's small business owners, like myself -- I'm a manufacturer, I'm on several boards in the Midwest in manufacturing.

What we'd like to see is not a government-operated market, but a free market. I sell (inaudible) equipment for a living. We have a trade show every year, and there's hundreds and hundreds of people selling competitive products. If we had a healthcare show in my town, there would be three or four people under that roof. And as a businessman yourself, you know what that does to driving down costs or the lack thereof. So we would like to see more of a free-market solution, going back to what made this country great -- entrepreneurialism instead of empowerments; work ethics instead of welfare. And that's what we'd like to ask you for. And I'd like to say thank you very much.

THE PRESIDENT: As you know, that's what we're doing largely, but we also have to take care of people that can't afford to be in a position like you are. So we're going to do that. Largely, I think beyond everything, if you look at what's going to happen -- the competitive bidding -- every element of what we're doing is competitive bidding, but we have to take care of people who need the help. And there are a lot of people like that.

MR. KNOX: There's always been a safety net in the United States, and there should be. And, unfortunately, when I see 50,000 -- or 50 million Americans taking assistance in -- you know, they're market food stamps. That's like -- for the people who really can't provide for themselves, you know, we're all charitable people who are Americans, we're the most generous nation on the face of the Earth. So I totally believe in safety nets for those who need them, not free handouts for (inaudible).

THE PRESIDENT: WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to help a lot of people, but we are going to be very much free market people. They can afford -- and they'll be off the cost.

Go ahead, Stan.

MR. SUMMERS: I'm Mr. Stan Summers from Box Elder County, northern Utah. I think I'm probably the only other elected official here besides you guys. It's been an interesting ride to watch the healthcare system in the last 26 years. When my son was born, he was three and a half months premature, 26 years ago. And we had really good insurance. We basically didnÃ¢ÂÂt have to pay anything out of pocket besides what we were doing from where I worked. As time went on, you could kind of tell the healthcare system has been a little bit broke, and then all of a sudden the ACA -- and I'm not going to call it the other word -- I call it the last President's healthcare program. I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to say that name.

So anyway --

THE PRESIDENT: Other than that, you like him a lot, right? (Laughter.)

MR. SUMMERS: Yeah, exactly. (Laughter.) It's gotten to the point where I own a couple of businesses too and do the things that I have to do. I actually ran for government so I could have insurance -- and won. But now I'm looking at these people, saying, how can I provide insurance for them without raising taxes and doing these things that are happening -- because everything has gone up. Utah didnÃ¢ÂÂt expand Medicaid -- we werenÃ¢ÂÂt a part of that -- and we can see why now, because of the things that are happening throughout the nation with states and companies and everybody else going bankrupt.

So it got to the point where I ended up -- not only with my businesses -- I have to drive a school bus to keep my wife at home with my kid that was ill. So now I own three businesses, I drive a school bus, and I'm an elected official, to be able to continue to do the things that I need to do with healthcare. The last three -- well, the last three years --

THE PRESIDENT: So it's gone through the roof.

MR. SUMMERS: Oh, I got a $6,000 deductible -- HSA -- but I will meet that again in three months. So I'm at -- I think my wife said morning, at 4,800 or 4,900 bucks already this year in March to be able to meet my out-of-pocket. And so by the time April comes, I would have met that to be able to continue to do. And if there was one thing I probably could ask you about -- and my boy has got a rare disease, and I appreciate you talking about the rare [disease] community in your speeches -- is that if somebody has cancer or somebody has a rare disease or continues to have problems, why do we have to do a deductible every year?

So IÃ¢ÂÂm sitting there at Christmas going, okay, my deductible has been met for six or eight months, and IÃ¢ÂÂm going to turn around and have to do it again for the same disease, for the same symptoms, for the same everything.

THE PRESIDENT: That's interesting. Tom, could you answer that? That would be interesting.

SECRETARY PRICE: ItÃ¢ÂÂs all about the risk and spreading the risk with insurance over a period of time. But it is a challenge for individuals with chronic disease, thereÃ¢ÂÂs no doubt about it.

MR. SUMMERS: And I appreciate you even thinking about it and talking about grassroots, and when you're talking about all the people that we support with the farmers and ranchers, and the small-business people, and the people that are in manufacturing, our county is one of the largest manufacturing counties in the nation per capita. And Nucor would love to tell you thanks -- Nucor Steel would love to tell you thanks for everything you've been doing.

THE PRESIDENT: Nucor has been very good. ItÃ¢ÂÂs going to get better, too.

MR. SUMMERS: And we've got a ton of those. The space program -- we used to make the shuttle boosters out of ATK Thiokal. And weÃ¢ÂÂd love to have the space program. I got a really good friend.

THE PRESIDENT: Those days are gone, but they're coming back.

MR. SUMMERS: IÃ¢ÂÂve got a friend that's going to go up in the next little bit, Lieutenant Commander Scott Maker Tingle, who is headed up on a spaceship from Russia. But he would love to come back to the United States and be able to go up through the United States. So all those jobs I know will come back with you.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, Gary Cohn, who is sitting right next to you, heÃ¢ÂÂs a big believer in what you're saying -- right, Gary?

MR. SUMMERS: If thereÃ¢ÂÂs anything we can do to help you, the counties are behind you. We can find you low-hanging fruit to be able to pick off that tree to help with jobs. Just let us know where we can help.

THE PRESIDENT: Good. Thank you, Stan.

MR. SUMMERS: Thank you for your time.

The expected testimony centered on a notorious pharmaceutical company who gave money to the Clinton Foundation in a bid to cover up their drug price gouging crimes.

According to reports, Ã¢ÂÂUS Federal Grand Jury had been impaneled to hear testimony from witnesses presented before it by FBI investigators and/or US AttorneysÃ¢ÂÂ.

On July 7th, the report continues, a massive explosion occurred that obliterated a two-story house. The shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away.

Ã¢ÂÂAs per standard protocol and procedures, this report details, SVR analysts, in their replying to the MoDÃ¢ÂÂs request for information about this Ã¢ÂÂeventÃ¢ÂÂ, conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosionÃ¢ÂÂ Carole Paladino, age 72, and her husband John Paladino, age 73Ã¢ÂÂwith, and very surprisingly to them, a SVR database Ã¢ÂÂtarget hitÃ¢ÂÂ on Carole Paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by SVR analysts as being a Ã¢ÂÂprobable witnessÃ¢ÂÂ against the Clinton Foundation.,

Ã¢ÂÂNow deceased Carole Paladino was the lead school nurse for Millville Public Schools located in Cumberland County, New JerseyÃ¢ÂÂand whose inclusion in the SVRÃ¢ÂÂs database of Ã¢ÂÂpotential witnessesÃ¢ÂÂ against the Clinton Foundation was due to her being a Ã¢ÂÂcentral identified and named figureÃ¢ÂÂ in the creation of a document titled Ã¢ÂÂTraining Protocols For The Emergency Administration Of EpinephrineÃ¢ÂÂ for the New Jersey Department of Education.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂEpinephrine (also called adrenaline), this report explains, is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxisÃ¢ÂÂthat is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause deathÃ¢ÂÂand whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen)Ã¢ÂÂand that the Carole Paladino collaborated on report for its Ã¢ÂÂemergency administrationÃ¢ÂÂ led New Jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their State, both public and private, to purchase itÃ¢ÂÂand their passing another law allowing New Jersey school nurses to, also, use EpiPens without parental permission.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂWhether knowingly, or not knowingly, Carole Paladino, by her being a Ã¢ÂÂmain targetÃ¢ÂÂ person in the plot to force all New Jersey schools to purchase EpiPens, she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in US historyÃ¢ÂÂthat began when the American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company Mylan N.V. suddenly began funneling money to the Clinton FoundationÃ¢ÂÂand that nearly immediately after which, saw Gayle Conelly Manchin take over as the head of the National Association of State Boards of EducationÃ¢ÂÂand who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged States to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactionsÃ¢ÂÂthat, in turn, helped pave the way for Mylan N.V., maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nursesÃ¢ÂÂ offices throughout the United StatesÃ¢ÂÂwith New Jersey is one of the 11 States drafting laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors be bought by schoolsÃ¢ÂÂand that the Obama-Clinton regime conspired with using their Ã¢ÂÂEpiPen LawÃ¢ÂÂ that gave funding preference to States that did what Gayle Conelly Manchin told them to do.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂUnbeknownst to the American people, this report notes, is that Gayle Conelly Manchin is the mother of Heather BreschÃ¢ÂÂwho, in 2012, right after her mother took control of the National Association of State Boards of Education and began her campaign to force schools to buy EpiPensÃ¢ÂÂbecame the CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan N.V.Ã¢ÂÂwith Heather Bresch, upon taking control, raising the price of EpiPens over 400% to $600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over $27 millionÃ¢ÂÂand whose Ã¢ÂÂprotectionÃ¢ÂÂ for this vile plot was provided by her father, and Gayle Conelly ManchinÃ¢ÂÂs husband, Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂTo an even greater scandal-catastrophe awaiting Hillary Clinton, as it dwarfs too near insignificance her EpiPen one, this report further notes, is her Ã¢ÂÂactive and knowingÃ¢ÂÂ participation in the United States opioid crisisÃ¢ÂÂthat the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the US have increased by 13.3 percent from August 2016 to August 2017, and now total 67,344 deaths per yearÃ¢ÂÂnearly all of which were deliberately caused by Oxycontin-maker Purdue PharmaÃ¢ÂÂwho, after funneling tens-of-millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, saw the Obama-Clinton regime to a Ã¢ÂÂblind eyeÃ¢ÂÂ to their flooding of America with opioidsÃ¢ÂÂand as exampled by Democratic Party US Senator Joe ManchinÃ¢ÂÂs home State of West Virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills, that roughly equals 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in his State.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThis report, after describing the horrific opioid crisis in America, concludes with SVR analysts noting that this past week, also, provided an explanation as to why the FBI task force investigating Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has been increasing their electronic communications with the United States AttorneyÃ¢ÂÂs Office for the Eastern District of TennesseeÃ¢ÂÂand that is due to a shocking court case currently underway in Knoxville, TennesseeÃ¢ÂÂthat was brought against the Clinton Foundation bribed pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III on behalf of the citizens of his StateÃ¢ÂÂand whose shocking to the conscious just released, by order of the court, documents stunningly reveal:

Ã¢ÂÂPurdueÃ¢ÂÂs own records show company founders and executives pressed its sales team to push Tennessee doctors to prescribe deadly dosages of Oxycontin on a long-term basis while lying to doctors about the dangers.

Purdue leaders lied to the medical community, politicians and the public not only about the dangers of Oxycontin but created a false narrative Ã¢ÂÂ that long-term use of opioids didnÃ¢ÂÂt create addicts but instead caused Ã¢ÂÂpseudo addictiveÃ¢ÂÂ symptoms.

The groups sought to convince the public they had a right to opioids. TennesseeÃ¢ÂÂs legislature was pushed by one of those advocacy groups to pass a law requiring doctors to prescribe opioids if a patient insisted.

Purdue also used fake advocacy literature, such as pamphlets, videos, and social media, to convince the public that long-term use of opioids led to a higher Ã¢ÂÂquality of life.Ã¢ÂÂ

The firm sent doctors fake literature with similar claims but added material on how Oxycontin Ã¢ÂÂ PurdueÃ¢ÂÂs financial rainmaker Ã¢ÂÂ was better for patients than other opioids on the market.Ã¢ÂÂ

24	"Transcript: NPR's Full Interview With Sen. Marco Rubio

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is running for president and spoke with NPR's Steve Inskeep on Monday ahead of his big announcement.

Rubio talked about how he hopes to stand out in the 2016 presidential field, Indiana's religious freedom law, the president's deal with Iran, immigration policy, and America's warming relationship with Cuba.

STEVE INSKEEP: In all the years I've been interviewing people, I don't think I've spoken with somebody on the day of an announcement like this. And I was thinking that if it were me, there might be a moment the night before where I was lying awake wondering if I was really ready for this. Did you have a moment of wondering if you were really ready for this?

SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Not last night, but, I mean, if you reach the point where you're wondering it the night before you announce, then you probably shouldn't run. I think anyone who's thinking about the highest office in the most powerful nation on earth has to spend some time analyzing whether they're prepared for the job. And look, I think the job is perhaps the most difficult job in politics anywhere in the world. You're the leader of the most powerful military on the planet. You make decisions that have global implications. And it's happening at a time when the country's going through an extraordinary economic transformation that is leaving many people insecure. But from all that and given both my experience at the local, state and federal level, and especially the lessons learned over the last five years as I've been engaged in federal policy making, I'm very confident that I have the judgment and the knowledge that I need to do a very good job as president of the United States. And clearly, as you see the history of the presidency, people who go into that office grow, the office helps you grow as well as you go through it and that's, having the ability to learn is a big part of the office as well. But I'm certainly capable from day 1. I'm very confident that I have the capability from day no. 1 to lead this country.

Are you also affirming that you are not giving up your Ã¢ÂÂ are you also affirming that you are not running for Senate?

I am not. And the reason I think strongly about that is, if you've decided that you want to serve this country as its president, that's what you should be running for. And I find myself in a situation where my Senate seat comes up for re-election at the exact same time as the presidency. And by Florida law, you can't run for both, anyway. But to even be thinking about a Plan B in case this doesn't work, I think diminishes your ability to succeed on the campaign because your mind will always be on, if this doesn't work, then I can do something else. And the truth is that, you know, I don't want to be in politics my entire life. And I'm prepared to serve this country now in its highest office and I'm excited about this opportunity.

You'll be in a crowded Republican field. How do you expect to distinguish yourself from your opponents on the Republican side?

Well, I expect that I'm going to go out and tell people my vision for the future of this country. I'm going to be very specific and detailed about our plans and how we're going to get there. In fact, I've done that already. We have a very detailed policy position that we've outlined on numerous issues over the last two years, culminating in my book that just came out earlier this year, American Dreams. And I think from that, voters are going to analyze the different position of the candidates, their capabilities, their history, but more importantly their view of the future and their plans to get us there and I'm very confident that that will lead to success.

Is there a sentence that people can have in their heads? Marco Rubio is different from the others because...

He has the clear view of how the 21st century can also be an American century.

We're in a moment where you have put out plans proposing to reshape the way the federal government deals with federal assistance to the poor.

Yes.

We're in a moment where Jeb Bush, who may also run, has a superPAC called Right to Rise. And this week, of course, Hillary Clinton declared her campaign for the presidency talking about helping everyday people. What's going on there?

Well, that's a good thing for our country because equality of opportunity has always defined us as a people and as a nation. And the fact that there are millions of people now in America that are starting to have significant doubts about whether we're still that kind of country should be deeply concerning to us. Our identity is at stake. Every country in the world has rich people. What makes America different is, we've had millions and millions of people who through hard work and perseverance are able to achieve happiness and upward mobility. And the fact that that's in danger and in question is deeply concerning, and should be. It threatens our identity. So I'm glad that people are talking about it. Ultimately, talking about it won't be enough. You have to have plans that work to help us address it. And for me it begins by embracing and acknowledging the reality that we are living through a massive transformation into this post-industrial 21st century economy that is both disruptive but also exciting. It comes not just with challenges, but also with opportunities. But we can only embrace those opportunities if we move forward on thinking about the changes we're going to have to make in order to fully enter the 21st century.

What's one way that your approach would be different from Jeb Bush's or Hillary Clinton's?

Well, as far as the Republican field is concerned, there will be plenty of time for comparison shopping. The truth is, for voters, the truth is that at this moment most of my opponents in the field beyond talking about upward mobility have not clearly outlined what they would do. We have a clear policy outline on each of these issues that people can read about. And if, you know, all of my opponents and other candidates in the Republican field choose to adopt some of those ideas, I'll consider that a victory as well as flattery. But on the Democratic side, I think, you know, Hillary Clinton is someone who's deeply wedded to the institutions of the 20th century. Her plans are to spend more money on the existing higher education system. That system doesn't work any more. It doesn't work any more because we don't graduate enough young people from high school ready to work. We need to do more of that Ã¢ÂÂ ready to work in trades as mechanics, airplane technicians and plumbers and engineers. These are good Ã¢ÂÂ welders. These are good 21st century jobs and we are capable of teaching people how to do that so at 18, 19 years of age, they can be employed. We also need to have more flexible, more flexibility in higher education for working Americans who can't afford to drop everything and go to school full-time for four years. We need to have programs that allow someone who works full time to learn at their own pace, on their own time, so that a receptionist can become a paralegal, so that the home-health aide making $10 an hour can become a dental hygienist making $55,000 a year. And then we have to have more quality measures in higher education. For example, before you take out a student loan--

Mhmm

I have a bill that says every student, before you take out a student loan, needs to be told how much you can expect to make when you graduate from that school with the degree you're pursuing so you can make an informed decision about whether or not it's worth it to borrow a bunch of money for that degree.

A Florida political reporter noticed that you spent a plane ride sitting beside Jeb Bush, more than two hours, coming back from an NRA convention. Did you guys talk about the presidential campaign at all?

Not in great detail. Jeb and I are friends, we'll always be friends. And I have tremendous admiration for him as a person, what he did as governor, and personal affection. And that's not going to change. I don't view, I'm not running against Jeb Bush and I'm not running against anybody in this field. I'm running because I strongly believe that I have something to offer this country that no one else in the field does at this moment in our history. And I'm going to go out there and do the best job that I can and Ã¢ÂÂ but, I mean, that's not going to impact our relationship in any way that's going to change how we feel about one another and it was great to see him and spend quality time just talking about good times and everything going on ...

You didn't talk politics very much at all?

... and everything in between. Sure, I mean we had observations about Ã¢ÂÂ we joked with a lot of the passengers who saw us sitting next to each other and we took some pictures with people and we told them, we warned them how historic a picture like that may be one day. And, um, but you know, we talked about the Masters, we talked about the Paleo diet, we talked about the Miami Dolphins. I mean it, we talked about, reminisced about old war stories from our time in the legislature, when I was in the legislature and he was governor. It was just a host of things.

Sooner or later if you go forward and he goes forward, there's going to be a moment where you're going to have to say, ""Here's why it should be me and not him.""

I don't know. I mean, I think this year's going to be quite different in that regard. We have a quality field of candidates who are going to be well financed and experienced, who are going to be running. And I think that'll change the nature of the race. There'll certainly be moments when others will try to draw distinctions. But in my mind, I'm going to talk about who I am and what I want to do. And I'll let voters make the decision about who they think is best capable at this moment of leading our country.

You scheduled an announcement at Miami's Freedom Tower, which has historic significance because Cubans who fled Fidel Castro's regime in the 60s and 70s received federal aid there. This brings to mind that you have strongly criticized President Obama's restoration of relations with Cuba. If you're elected, would you reverse that policy?

Absolutely, and I think the reason why is because I'm interested in, my interest in Cuba is freedom and democracy. I think the Cuban people, they are free, have the right to choose any economic model they want to follow. I don't believe these changes will actually further democracy. In fact, I think they will make it harder to achieve. The goal of the Castro regime is to create the impression and the reality that their form of government is a legitimate form of government and set it in concrete. They know they have a generational challenge. Most of their top leaders are in their 80s. The actuarial tables tell you they don't have much longer. And they want to leave in place global recognition for this form of government so that it can continue in perpetuity. And that means the Cuban people will never have the chance to experience what the people in the Dominican Republic and Haiti have, what the people in Mexico have, what the people in Peru have, what the people in Colombia have, which is free and fair elections. And that's all I want for the people in Cuba. And I think U.S. policy towards Cuba is a major leverage point that we can use to help the Cuban people achieve freedom for themselves.

But help me think through this. The president made this announcement, they're working on getting an embassy going at some point in the future. He went to Summit of the Americas where other countries in Latin America very much welcomed the restoration of relations. You're saying that if you're elected, you would close that embassy, you would break diplomatic ties, you would go back to the way things were?

We have an interest section in Cuba and it will continue to operate, but an embassy, I'm not, I don't believe this country should be diplomatically recognizing a nation of the nature of Cuba. Obviously there are other dictatorships in the world that we have relations with by geopolitical reality. You know, China's the largest country in the world, the second largest economy, the second largest military force. There are geopolitical realities there. Cuba is a brutal, tyrannical dictatorship 90 miles from the shore of our country. It is a nation that helps North Korea evade U.N. weapon sanctions. It is a country that harbors fugitives from American justice, including Medicare fraudsters and someone who killed a police officer in the United States. And I just think that we should have continued with the policy and perhaps looked for new ways of Ã¢ÂÂ continue with the policy of not recognizing that regime and not allowing them access to economic growth that would allow them to perpetuate themselves in power, and continue to search for ways to provide the Cuban people with more information about the reality of the world so they would be empowered to eventually create for themselves a democratic society.

You've also said that you would reverse the president's deal with Iran, assuming that that is finalized. You said you would absolutely do that. What would that look like on day one?

Well, I would not adhere Ã¢ÂÂ well, we have to understand the deal, basically, can be what it is on paper. What the president is banking on is that he's going to use a national security waiver to lift the sanctions on Iran, the economic sanctions that now exist. And we would simply re-impose the sanctions. And I still have tremendous questions about whether this deal's even viable. The Iranians are now saying that what we're saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things. This issue of them asking for immediate relief of sanctions the minute the deal is signed is going to be a deal breaker. I hope it would be a deal break for this administration. And at the end of the day, we need to recognize that what Iran is trying to do here, and this is clear to anyone who has inside knowledge into this or has followed it closely, Iran is trying to maintain all the infrastructure they need to be nuclear capable without agreeing to any irreversible concessions. And that seems to be what they have achieved, if in fact this moves forward. So in my mind, we would just reinstitute the sanctions.

But I'm just thinking this through. The deal is made. It's made not just with the United States, but with the European allies. Would you move forward with re-imposing sanctions even if the Europeans don't go along with it?

Yes, it wouldn't be as effective, obviously. We would, ultimately, I think, the Europeans are going to have a test anyway because the Iranians are going to violate the sanctions at some point. They're going to evade it either by trying to take advantage of loopholes in the deal, or they'll just flat out evade it because they've always had a secret component to their, to their program. And at that point, they're going to have a huge test on their hands, which is, are they willing to live by the agreement that they even signed on to? But from the United States' perspective, while we want our allies to join us in this endeavor, and certainly sanctions against Iran would be more effective were they in conjunction with our allies around the world, we have to look out for our own national security concerns. And in my mind, if the president wanted this to be a permanent deal that survived his presidency, he would have brought it to Congress.

I'm just thinking through further, though, as part of this deal, assuming it's finalized, the Iranians get rid of a vast amount of enriched uranium, almost all they have. They limit the amount of enrichment that they will have. They limit the number of centrifuges they will operate and they will allow inspections for decades, actually. So you would say, all that, forget about it, it's done.

They would retain all the infrastructure, first of all, they ...

They retain infrastructure, sure.

They retain not only just infrastructure, they retain centrifuges, too. They may not be spinning them, but they will retain them in their possession. They continue to develop their long range missile capabilities, which are unstopped. There's no prohibition on them acquiring a weapon design as they probably, may even already have. They continue to sponsor terrorism all over the world. In fact, now they'll have more funding to pay for it, in places they already control, places like Beirut. They're increasingly active in Yemen. Their hand and their role's clear in Bahrain and in a growing number of places around the world. And they continue to be run by a radical Shia cleric who has apocalyptic views of the future and of their role in it. So none of these things change. Their infrastructure will remain in place and at some point, they could follow the North Korean model very easily, which is they can cook up an excuse for why they need to have a weapon program and move forward on it.

Is war inevitable then?

I hope not. My hope is that we can delay a program long enough and you would hope that there would be some sort of change in leadership in Iran that would at least allow them to decide that they would rather have an economy than have a weapon. You can't guarantee it. But at the end of the day no one wants war, but I actually think that this deal could advance the prospects of war. I think this deal and the fact that Iran will retain nuclear infrastructure increases the likelihood that one of their neighbors may take action against them, whether it's Israel or the Saudis or someone else. It also increases the likelihood now, that Iran becomes even more aggressive in its proxy wars that it's conducting all over the world. It also increases the likelihood that they'll increase their conventional capabilities threatening our U.S. presence in the region. And ultimately I think it almost guarantees an arms race in the region, because the Saudis have made very clear, and others, the Egyptians as well, that whatever Iran has, they'll get as well. So if Iran is allowed to enrich to a certain level, they will begin doing the same, requiring a capability to do the same.

Let me ask about a domestic issue. In recent weeks, the state of Indiana passed a Religious Freedom law, which was interpreted by many as discrimination, by others, as protection for people who don't want to take part in gay marriage. You defended the law and spoke about the hypothetical example of a florist who was asked to participate in a gay marriage and wanted to refuse. You said that person should have the right to follow their religious beliefs. Indiana, though, has since changed the law. Do you still support that concept?

Well, to be fair, I haven't read the change in detail to give you an opinion on it specifically, but I'll tell you where I stand. I don't believe you can discriminate against people. So I don't believe it's right for a florist to say, I'm not going to provide you flowers because you're gay. I think there's a difference between not providing services to a person because of their identity, who they are or who they love, and saying, I'm not going to participate in an event, a same-sex wedding, because that violates my religious beliefs. There's a distinction between those two things. So, certainly, you can't not Ã¢ÂÂ it's immoral and wrong to say, I'm not going to allow someone who's gay or lesbian to use my restaurant, stay in my hotel, or provide photography service to them because they're gay. The difference here is, we're not talking about discriminating against a person because of who they are, we're talking about someone who's saying Ã¢ÂÂ what I'm talking about, anyway, is someone who's saying, I just don't want to participate as a vendor for an event, a specific event that violates the tenets of my faith.

What if two gay people get married and then they go that night to a hotel. Can the hotelkeeper refuse service to them?

That's not part of an event. Again, I mean, that's, there's a difference between saying, we're not going to allow you to stay in our hotel, common lodging establishment where people have a right to shelter, food, medical care, and saying we're not going to, what we're not going to do is provide services to an event, to an actual event, which is the wedding itself. And I think that's the distinction point that people have been pointing to, and, because mainstream Christianity teaches that marriage is between one man and one woman. People feel very strongly about that. And to ask someone to individually provide services to something of that nature, I think violates their religious liberty.

There's a big question lurking here, which is that most Americans, according to surveys, now support gay marriage. A large minority of Americans still oppose gay marriage. The question is, that people seem to be wrestling with, is, what ground do opponents of gay marriage have left to stand on? What ground should they have to stand on?

First of all, if the majority of Americans support gay marriage, then you'll see it reflected in changes in state law, which has always regulated marriage. And so at the end of the day, if a majority of people in any given state in this country petition their legislature to change the definition of marriage to include the marriage of two people of the same sex, that'll be the law of the land. And that is what it is. Separate from that, there's a constitutional protection of religious liberty that allows people to live by the tenets of their faith both in their public and in private life. That doesn't mean that you're allowed to go in and disrupt a gay wedding. But by the same token, it doesn't mean that someone's allowed to come to you and force you to be a participant in a ceremony that violates the tenets of your faith. And to be honest, in the real world, 99.9% of the time, a same-sex couple doesn't want a florist or a photographer at their wedding that doesn't agree with the choice that they've made. So we're really talking about an issue that in large part is really not going to manifest itself in daily life, but in the instances that it does, there are individuals that don't want to be compelled by force of law to participate in an event that puts them in the position of violating their religious faith. There's a difference between that and discriminating against an individual because of who they are.

Are there are other specific situations on your mind where you feel that people who are opposed to gay marriage would need some kind of protection from, from it?

Well, I mean, that's the one that's in the news today. Again, I don't, we can always sit here and engage in hypotheticals, this, that, and the other, but at the end of the day, I mean, that's the one that's emerged because there's real cases behind people being fined for not providing services to a, to a ceremony as opposed to individuals.

When we spoke last year, we talked about immigration, an issue on which you worked for a time on an immigration reform bill. You said, first, the reason to do that is not political, it's substantive. But, second, that there would be a political effect. That if the Republican Party deals with immigration, it would then have an opportunity to talk with Latino voters about other issues. And, of course, this is a voter group where Republicans have done very poorly in recent elections. Immigration hasn't been dealt with. What are the likely consequences for the Republican party in 2016?

Well, again, every candidate has a different position on where they stand on the issue. From my perspective, I continue to believe it's an issue we need to address. The only point I've made is that I think the lessons of the last couple of years, for me, is that we're not going to be able to deal with it in one big piece of legislation. I still think we need to do immigration reform. I just don't think you can do it in a comprehensive, massive piece of legislation, given the lack of trust that there is today in the federal government. I honestly believe that the key to moving forward on immigration is to first and foremost prove to the American people that we are going to bring future illegal immigration under control Ã¢ÂÂ that if we legalize 12 million people, they won't be replaced by 12 million more who are here illegally. And I honestly believe, given my experiences on this issue now, that if we did that, the American people and the majority of Republicans and conservatives will be very reasonable and, and responsible about how we address the reality that we have 12 million human beings living in this country illegally.

But we're in a circumstance, granted there's still time, but we're in a circumstance where it doesn't look like immigration legislation is going to get through Congress before 2016. What does that mean for your party?

And I think, I think it's nearly Ã¢ÂÂ well, I just outlined to you what I think the key is to moving forward. And I think that's impossible as long as Barack Obama's president now, because on two instances, particularly very recently, last year, he issued an executive order ordering federal agencies not to enforce immigration law. So if I'm telling you that the key to moving forward is the enforcement of immigration law, then that says the notion that future illegal immigration will be brought under control, and you have a president that's ordering agencies not to enforce immigration law, our ability to convince people, no matter what we pass, that future illegal immigration will be brought under control, as long as Barack Obama's president, is nil.

How do you keep from getting hammered on that in a general election where the Hispanic vote may be very important?

Well, I don't know about the others, but I've done more immigration than Hillary Clinton ever did. I mean, I helped pass an immigration bill in a Senate dominated by Democrats. And that's more than she's ever done. She's given speeches on it, but she's never done anything on it. So I have a record of trying to do something on it. It didn't work because at the end of the day, we did not sufficiently address the issue of, of illegal immigration and I warned about that throughout that process, as well, that I didn't think we were doing enough to give that bill a chance of moving forward in the House.

Does your biography help?

I think biography's part of all of our lives, all of our candidacies, because it certainly influences how you view the country and how you view issues. I have a personal attachment to the working class because it's where I come from, it's still the neighborhood I live in, it's the people my children go to school with, it's the community that I'm involved in. And, but I also happen to think it's the identity of our country. And every candidate, you know, will bring to bear their experiences in life and how it's guided them and influenced their thinking, but from my perspective, I think it matters simply because it informs me on my policy decisions.

There's a big question here, also, because the Republican party, as many people have noted, faces a demographic challenge that gets a little worse with every election cycle. Growing groups in society, such as Latinos and others, are voting increasingly Democratic, and Republican voter groups, particularly older white voters, are getting smaller. What's the Republican Party need to do about that?

Well, at the end, I don't think people go to the ballot box and say, I'm a Latino, therefore I'm voting Democrat. I think they bring with them their hopes and fears about the future, and they vote for whoever they think best understands them. And the challenge the Republican Party has had is unfairly, but it's the reality, they've been portrayed as a party that doesn't care about people who are trying to make it. A disproportionate number of people who are trying to make it, who are working class, who are out there working for a living at $18 an hour, $15 an hour, happen to also be people from minority communities. And if you think someone doesn't care or understand people like you, no matter what your policies are, it's going to be difficult to get them to listen to you, much less vote for you. And so I hope the Republican Party can become the champion of the working class because I think our policy proposals of limited government and free enterprise are better for the people who are trying to make it than big government is. The fact is that big government helps the people who have made it. If you can afford to hire an army of lawyers, lobbyists and others to help you navigate and sometimes influence the law, you'll benefit. And so that's why you see big banks, big companies, keep winning. And everybody else is stuck and being left behind.

So you're beginning this gigantic game of Survivor with who knows how many other candidates. You're smiling as I say that. With who knows how many other candidates, what will determine who survives ultimately and how will you make sure it's you?

Well, there are basics about any campaign. Obviously you'll have to put time into it, you'll have to be able to raise sufficient funds to communicate your message. And on a daily basis, you have to make sure you do the best you can to help convince people in a crowded field that you're the best person at this time for the job that you seek. But beyond it, I really think the key is, who can inspire our country into believing that the future doesn't have to be worse than our past, that the 21st century can be better than the 20th. And then once you've inspired them to believe that, showing them how we can accomplish it. And I feel very confident in our ability to do it and I think that's why we're going to win.

Should I think of this as an insurgent campaign, because you don't have the resources of Jeb Bush, particularly?

Well, I think our resources will be sufficient to do the job we're trying to do. At the end of the day, this is not a fundraising competition in and of itself. You also have to have a message and a messenger and a policy outline that proves to people that, that your campaign is better for them than what someone else is offering. But I'm certainly not the frontrunner and Ã¢ÂÂ but that's O.K. The election isn't tomorrow.

What are you doing to make sure you don't run out of money?

(Laughs) We're going to, we, we're trying to raise as much money as we can and that's important. As long as the media outlets keep charging us for advertising, we'll have to keep raising money.

Senator Rubio, thanks very much.

Thank you."	0

It turns out that one reason why Estonia has been the lone feel-good story amidst the Eurozone crisis is that its tax filing system is scarily efficient.

Introduced in 2000, the system allows individual income taxes, business taxes and excises to be filed electronically.

Using a secure ID, a filer simply completes pre-made forms and approves the document with a digital signature.

The process takes an average of five minutes, and last year 94% of tax declarations were filed electronically.

The system is part of the country's impressive e-government initiative, which allows Estonians to do everything from vote to fill out prescriptions to look up school grades online.

27	"President Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border.

Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018

Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the Ã¢ÂÂharmÃ¢ÂÂ he claims. The Ã¢ÂÂBe careful what you wish for Max!Ã¢ÂÂ quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps Ã¢ÂÂthe Second Amendment peopleÃ¢ÂÂ i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.

While some people may consider TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.

Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is pled guilty on April 16th to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd Ã¢ÂÂfaces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.Ã¢ÂÂ

LloydÃ¢ÂÂs plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman WatersÃ¢ÂÂ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:

Ã¢ÂÂIf you continue to make threats towards the president, youÃ¢ÂÂre going to wind up dead, Maxine, Ã¢ÂÂcause weÃ¢ÂÂll kill you.Ã¢ÂÂ

The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a Ã¢ÂÂspur of the momentÃ¢ÂÂ decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.

Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.

The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.

When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs feet.

Correction: The original headline to this story erroneously implied that Anthony Scott Lloyd, the man who threatened Rep. Waters, did so on the same day as President TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs tweet about the Congresswoman on June 25th. An editing error also caused the timing of the guilty plea to be reported as happening that same day, even though it actually took place over two months prior to TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs June 25th tweet. The story has been revised to reflect the actual chronology of the events. Washington Press greatly regrets the errors.

President Trump has sent tweets criticizing Rep. Waters prior to the tweet on June 25th, including this one from March prior to Mr. LloydÃ¢ÂÂs plea. Therefore the conclusion that TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs bullying tactics have dangerous real life consequences remains valid."	1

WOODRUFF: Good evening, and thank you. We are happy to welcome you to Milwaukee for this Democratic debate.

WOODRUFF: We are especially pleased to thank our partners at Facebook, who have helped us set up a vibrant conversation among voters who are undecided. And tonight you're going to hear some of their questions for the candidates. And you can follow along at home on the PBS NewsHour page on Facebook.

We also want to thank our hosts, the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, on whose campus we meet, here in the beautiful Helen Bader Concert Hall.

IFILL: We want to also extend our warm thanks to Milwaukee Public Radio and Milwaukee Public Television, as well as all of our friends at the PBS member stations across the country tuning in tonight.

This is the sixth time the Democrats have met face to face. Each time, we learn more about them and the presidents they say they want to be. You know you're watching -- whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, or neither -- because you believe the outcome of the election is important to you. And we believe that, too.

With that, let's welcome the candidates to the stage. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

(APPLAUSE)

WOODRUFF: Welcome, Senator, great to see you.

Advertisement

And former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

(APPLAUSE)

Very good to be here with you.

CLINTON: Thank you.

IFILL: Welcome to you both.

WOODRUFF: Now, a word about format. There will be two short breaks, and the rules are simple: 90 seconds for each answer and 30 seconds for the other candidate to respond.

IFILL: With Iowa and New Hampshire behind us, we are now broadening the conversation to America's heartland and beyond, including here in Wisconsin. Now let's turn to the candidates for their opening statements. The order was decided by coin toss. And, Senator Sanders, you go first.

SANDERS: Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event. And, PBS, thank you.

Nine months ago, our campaign began. And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont. A lot has happened in nine months.

Advertisement

And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.

SANDERS: And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers. They are worried to death about the future of their kids. And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.

And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.

Advertisement

They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. No criminal records for them.

I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.

Thank you.

IFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders.

(APPLAUSE)

IFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders.

Secretary Clinton.

CLINTON: I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.

Advertisement

I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy. And for good cause. Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years. There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people. And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.

We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.

But I want to go further. I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now. African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.

Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future. Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.

Advertisement

I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential. That will be my mission as president. And I think together we will make progress.

WOODRUFF: Thank you both.

(APPLAUSE)

WOODRUFF: Thank you both. And we'll be right back after a short break to begin questions.

WOODRUFF: And, welcome back to this PBS Newshour debate, Democratic debate, here in Milwaukee. Let's get right to the questions.

Senator Sanders, to you first. Coming off the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, there are many voters who are taking a closer look at you, and your ideas, and they're asking how big a role do you foresee for the federal government? It's already spending 21% of the entire U.S. economy. How much larger would government be in the lives of Americans under a Sanders presidency?

Advertisement

SANDERS: Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled. In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.

What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people. Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.

I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free. I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind. Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.

Advertisement

Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.

WOODRUFF: But, my question is how big would government be? Would there be any limit on the size of the role of government...

SANDERS: ... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth. Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living. CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.

Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare. Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math. This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.

SANDERS: Well, let us level with the American people. Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.

I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people. We're not going to dismantle everything. But, here is the truth.

Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America. We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing. Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments. What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.

In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.

CLINTON: I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage. You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare. And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.

(APPLAUSE)

And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done. We are at 90 percent coverage. We have to get the remaining 10. I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.

And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share. But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work. If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.

So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.

IFILL: Final thought, Senator.

SANDERS: That is absolutely inaccurate. Look, here is the reality, folks. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.

Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.

CLINTON: Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...

(APPLAUSE)

... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care. I believe we are on the path to doing that. The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.

And we are not England. We are not France. We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers. So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage. We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100. I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.

(APPLAUSE)

IFILL: I'd like to move along. I'd like to move along.

Secretary Clinton, you might -- you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government. You may remember this pledge from a State of the Union Address at which I believe you were present, in which these words were said: ""The era of big government is over."" You may remember that.

When asked your feelings about the federal government this week, 61 percent of New Hampshire Democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied. Given what you and Senator Sanders are proposing, an expanding government in almost every area of our lives, is it fair for Americans who fear government to fear you?

CLINTON: No. But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?

In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.

I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning. There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government. I'm aware of that. It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.

CLINTON: So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.

IFILL: But I haven't heard either of you put a price tag on your -- you say...

(CROSSTALK)

CLINTON: I will put a price tag. My price tag is about $100 billion a year. And again, paid for. And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt. I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.

And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.

But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.

IFILL: Senator?

SANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet. And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for. For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling? Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?

Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent? Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.

We need to create jobs. So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.

Yes, I'm going to do away with that. We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure. Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.

Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.

We bailed them out. Now it is their time to help the middle class.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans. And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.

We differ, however, on a couple of key points. One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.

And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.

(APPLAUSE)

WOODRUFF: Next, we're going to...

SANDERS: A brief response.

WOODRUFF: Very brief, thank you.

SANDERS: Here is where we are with public education. A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms. Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.

And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade. The world has changed. This is 2016. In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.

So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities. That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.

(APPLAUSE)

WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, your campaign -- you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters. You have talked repeatedly about the fact, we know you would be, if elected, the first woman president.

But in New Hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for Senator Sanders. What are women missing about you?

CLINTON: Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me. I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.

And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face. So I'm going to keep making that case. I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.

But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support. I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me. That's what I'm working towards.

(APPLAUSE)

WOODRUFF: As you know, just quickly, as you know, your strong supporter, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said the other day that there's a special place in Hell for women who don't support other women. Do you agree with what she said?

CLINTON: Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years. But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make. That's what I've always stood for.

And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.

I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage. So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.

(APPLAUSE)

WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders, you're in the minority, but we still want to hear from you.

(LAUGHTER) SANDERS: Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans. We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.

I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record. I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.

I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.

(APPLAUSE)

IFILL: Senator, do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history, as Senator Clinton keeps claiming, that she might be the first woman president?

SANDERS: Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman. I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.

(APPLAUSE)

And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record. And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues. I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.

CLINTON: I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues. Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.

So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.

(APPLAUSE)

WOODRUFF: Final comment.

SANDERS: Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country. And I will tell you something that really galls me. I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy. Just a little bit.

All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government. Government is the enemy. We're going to cut Social Security to help you. We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.

But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.

If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.

(APPLAUSE)

IFILL: Thank you both.

IFILL: We turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at Facebook. They were selected from a curated group of people we've been following of undecided voters.

The first comes from Claudia Looze, a 54-year-old woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in Madison, Wisconsin. And she writes: ""Wisconsin is number one in African-American male incarceration, according to a University of Wisconsin study. They found that Wisconsin's incarceration rate for black men, which is at 13 percent, was nearly double the country's rate. What can we do across the nation to address this?""

Senator Sanders.

SANDERS: This is one of the great tragedies in our country today. And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug. It has to be dealt with. Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail. That is beyond unspeakable.

So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods. The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.

The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana. Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations. The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.

We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system. I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.

What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders. The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.

The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average. And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.

His family certainly believes that. And so do I. So we have work to do. There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. President Obama's policing commission came out with some. I have fully endorsed those.

CLINTON: But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.

And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.

But, I would also add this. There are other racial discrepancies. Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities. So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with. This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea. It takes away discretion from judges. We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.

(APPLAUSE)

We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see. People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again. So, we have a lot of work to do.

But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge. When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size. Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.

We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.

(APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, I was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for President Obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership, and his example. Hardly anyone believes that they have. Why do you think race relations would be better under a Clinton presidency? What would you do that the nation's first African American has not been able to?

CLINTON: Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment. I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did. We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.

So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society. I think President Obama has set a great example. I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward. Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.

We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system. We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.

But, we can't rest. We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before. So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open. Nobody can deny them. To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out. So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.

(APPLAUSE)

WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders?

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt. People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings. Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard. As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.

So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism. We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs because it is. Google ""shark,"" and up pops a great photo of a shark stalking a kayak from a 2005 issue of Africa Geographic.. Commenters on Reddit, where the photo seems to have originated, quickly noted this and the very real similarities between the two sharks (note the small circular shadow just below the shark's belly.)

Some sites have since realized their error. Neatorama, for example, has removed its story with the photo called ""Thank you, Hurricane Irene: Shark in the street."" We've asked Channel 7 in Miami, which broadcast the user-submitted photo, if it plans to inform viewers about its fakeness. We will update this post if we hear back.

This phenomenon is nothing new. After the death of Osama bin Laden, a fake photo of his body circulated on Arab news outlets. When the earthquake hit Japan, photographs of a damaged church started circulating. The church was located in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Fred Thompson is laying on the southern-fried charm. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a tire-melting afternoon in June, and the son of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, turned two-term United States senator, Law & Order star, and now almost Republican presidential candidate has just arrived at the Clarion Townhouse hotel in Columbia, South Carolina, for a state-party fund-raiser. A crush of reporters has swarmed him, one of whom has just asked if today will be the day Thompson makes things official. Thompson delivers his honey-smooth reply as if on cue. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm just testing the waters, but the water is pretty warm,Ã¢ÂÂ he says as he plows toward the ballroom.

Inside, his wife, Jeri, and 3-year-old daughter, Hayden, hug Thompson. The family settles on the dais and is consumed in a lightning storm of flash photography. The six-foot-five, cigar-smoking ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs calling card is his cozy, avuncular folksiness, and he seems nothing if not at home here among his people. Jeri is a formidable womanÃ¢ÂÂa former Senate staffer and spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee who is said to be the true force behind her husbandÃ¢ÂÂs decision to run and a key operative in his campaign. She also happens to be blonde, gorgeous, and two dozen years younger than her husband. She is dressed today in a purple skirt cut an inch or so above the knees that has definitely caught the attention of the locals. Hayden, saucer-eyed and adorable in a flower-print dress, smiles shyly. Thompson is only 64, but the family tableau makes him look a bit old and wan.

The room settles down, and Thompson steps to the microphone. He goes straight to Page One of the Thompson scriptÃ¢ÂÂa bit of homey Mayberry RFD bemusement directed at those crazy city slickers in Washington. Ã¢ÂÂI was telling one of my buddies up there, Ã¢ÂÂYou know, itÃ¢ÂÂs kind of strange. People are always asking me the difference between show business and politics and so forth.Ã¢ÂÂ And he says, Ã¢ÂÂWell, donÃ¢ÂÂt you see the deal? Politics is show business for ugly people.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Thompson pauses for a moment and grins. Ã¢ÂÂAnd then he says, Ã¢ÂÂThompson, you got it all covered.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Everyone laughs.

Today, the immigration bill hangs in the balance, and Thompson, who sells himself as the only genuine red-meat conservative among the leading GOP contenders, lays into his wussy opponents. Ã¢ÂÂWe canÃ¢ÂÂt drop another 12 million people and be able to cope with that. WeÃ¢ÂÂve already got a 24-hour rule. If you canÃ¢ÂÂt prove theyÃ¢ÂÂre terrorists within 24 hours, youÃ¢ÂÂve got to pass them. You know the dog ainÃ¢ÂÂt eating the dog food when they put that one out there.Ã¢ÂÂ

Someone shouts Ã¢ÂÂGo, Fred, go.Ã¢ÂÂ

Now itÃ¢ÂÂs back to the outsider theme, but this time Thompson is more slick. The subject is the Iraq war, a conflict that Thompson has staunchly supported. Ã¢ÂÂPeople talk about the last election. They say, Ã¢ÂÂThe war, the war, the war,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Thompson says with a sigh. Ã¢ÂÂI think it has to do more with corruption and spending than it did the war, and itÃ¢ÂÂs understandable. Sad to say some of our folks went to Washington to drain the swamp and made partnership with the alligators instead.Ã¢ÂÂ

A minute later, Thompson offers what has now become a hallmark tease. Ã¢ÂÂMaybe I can come back a little bit later in a different capacity and we can talk a little bit more about some of these issues.Ã¢ÂÂ The applause builds to a standing ovation. Ã¢ÂÂYou know, I had another comment or two,Ã¢ÂÂ Thompson says, Ã¢ÂÂbut I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs the perfect place to stop.Ã¢ÂÂ

Thompson sticks around for five minutes afterward to answer a few questions from reporters and pose for pictures with old ladies asking that a fence be built around America. I try to force him to improv a little by asking whether it was too late for him to mobilize a modern presidential campaign. But the man can hit his mark. Ã¢ÂÂYou know, they said that you had to raise $100 million this year to compete,Ã¢ÂÂ Thompson says as his aides try to get him to turn rightward toward the cameras. Ã¢ÂÂWithout raising a dime, I was in the pack. So IÃ¢ÂÂve already saved $50 million this year.Ã¢ÂÂ Then Thompson smiles and lopes toward the exit. The former actor is done shooting for the day.

Since announcing this spring that he was considering a presidential run, Fred Thompson has improbably jumped to the front of the line for the GOP nomination. In two mid-July polls, Thompson led Rudolph Giuliani by a point or two, and while other recent surveys show the former New York mayor in the lead, ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs strength in key southern states, including the aforementioned South Carolina, has not gone unnoticed. This despite the fact that the famously laid-back Thompson has barely campaigned, forgoing the roll-up-your-sleeves-and-make-a-thousand-trips-to-Iowa strategy in favor of the odd Leno appearance and a YouTube jab at Michael Moore, in which he essentially told Moore that if he didnÃ¢ÂÂt love America, he should leave it, and go to Cuba.

So far, the Thompson bubble has floated skyward on several favorable updrafts. HeÃ¢ÂÂs the newest man in the raceÃ¢ÂÂand one with celebrity name recognition. HeÃ¢ÂÂs a Southerner and arguably the most conservative candidate in a field devoid of hard-liners. Despite his eight years in the Senate, people seem to buy the idea, for the time being anyway, that heÃ¢ÂÂs a Washington outsider. And all of his opponents have significant liabilities. But then again, so does Thompson. Among them are his work ethic and authenticity.

Thompson is often compared to Ronald Reagan, not just because they are both actors, but also because of each manÃ¢ÂÂs almost preternatural affability. But Reagan was an unalloyed ideologue when America was looking for one, with eight years as the chief executive of what amounts to one of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest countries. He wasnÃ¢ÂÂt elected until his third campaign, when he defeated a weak Democratic incumbent. Fred Thompson is in a different place. If heÃ¢ÂÂs going to be elected the leader of the Free World, he may have to do it on the strength of his not inconsiderable personal charm.

You canÃ¢ÂÂt get to Fred ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs hometown from here. Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, is located 28 miles from the nearest interstate. Its rolling hills are picturesquely dotted with pigs and cattle, but it remains one of the stateÃ¢ÂÂs poorest areas. Ã¢ÂÂThis town hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been the same since the Yankees came in and opened the Murray bike factory,Ã¢ÂÂ says Tommy Beuerlein, who owns a downtown pharmacy and was a classmate of ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs. The bike factory arrived in 1955. Ã¢ÂÂNixon was right about there being a silent majority in America,Ã¢ÂÂ Beuerlein proudly says. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs right here.Ã¢ÂÂ

On a recent summer day, eighteen people attended a city-council meeting dealing with the local problem of illegal dumping of couches. A few steps away, 71 residents, some of them as young as 9, attended a shotgun-safety class. Ã¢ÂÂYou have to respect your zone of fire,Ã¢ÂÂ insisted the instructor. Ã¢ÂÂVice-President Cheney didnÃ¢ÂÂt respect his zone of fire, and look what happened.Ã¢ÂÂ

Much of ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs down-home affability can be attributed to his roots in Lawrenceburg, where as a child he pretended to be Western star Lash LaRue and courted his high-school sweetheart underneath the townÃ¢ÂÂs Davy Crockett statue (true story). But while Thompson may be a country boy, heÃ¢ÂÂs a certain type of country boy: the one who plays possum while you mock his cornpone ways. Next thing you know heÃ¢ÂÂs got your girl and holds the deed to your farm.

ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs father, Fletch, ran a used-car lot in the center of town, and would talk Republican politics at the Blue Ribbon CafÃÂ©. Neither of ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs parents attended high school (his father eventually earned a GED), and Fred, the first of two sons, proved to be an indifferent but popular student. Even as a kid, Fred had a flair for showmanship. One of the building blocks of the Thompson legend is the story of his concerned football coachÃ¢ÂÂs running onto the field to check on an injured Thompson. When coach Garner Ezell reached his player, Thompson smiled at his fellow Church of Christ parishioner and quipped, Ã¢ÂÂHowÃ¢ÂÂs the crowd takinÃ¢ÂÂ it?Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂFred said it,Ã¢ÂÂ says Ezell. Ã¢ÂÂBut he wasnÃ¢ÂÂt ever hurt. He was just tired and wanted a rest.Ã¢ÂÂ

Even a blind squirrel sometimes finds a nut, and Thompson has always seemed to have a way of stumbling into success. By all accounts, ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs work ethic kicked in at 17, when he got his sweetheart Sarah Lindsey pregnant and immediately proposed. Ã¢ÂÂI barely got out of high school,Ã¢ÂÂ Thompson told the Washington Post in 1985. Ã¢ÂÂI was interested in two thingsÃ¢ÂÂand sports was one of them.Ã¢ÂÂ

Because of his marriage, Thompson didnÃ¢ÂÂt play sports his senior year, and he put in long shifts at the bike factory to support his new family. The following fall, the newlyweds headed to nearby Florence State, now the University of North Alabama, before transferring to Memphis State, from which they both graduated. SarahÃ¢ÂÂs grandfather was an influential Lawrenceburg lawyer, and her family urged Thompson to apply to Vanderbilt Law School. After graduating, the couple moved back to Lawrenceburg, and Thompson practiced law with SarahÃ¢ÂÂs uncle and began dabbling in local GOP politics, eventually joining the countyÃ¢ÂÂs Republican Executive Committee. It was through that group that Thompson caught the eye of another accidental benefactor, Tennessee senator Howard Baker. Thompson worked on BakerÃ¢ÂÂs 1972 reelection, sometimes driving the senator around Tennessee, and the two men struck up a friendship.

By the next year, Watergate was everywhere. And while Yale and Harvard up-and-comers like Hillary Clinton and Bill Weld clawed for minor legal positions, Baker offered Thompson a coveted slot as minority counsel on the Senate Watergate Committee.

In 1975, Thompson wrote about the experience in his book At That Point in Time: The Inside Story of the Senate Watergate Committee, portraying himself as the picture of the awestruck country lawyer. He insists when Baker offered him the job in February of 1973, Ã¢ÂÂthe only names I could recall without prompting were Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy.Ã¢ÂÂ

Because it was a Republican investigator who had uncovered the fact that Nixon aide Alexander Butterfield had admitted that the White House featured an elaborate taping system, Baker insisted that a Republican cross-examine Butterfield the next day so the GOP could maintain the illusion of impartialityÃ¢ÂÂand take credit. On national television, Thompson asked Butterfield the now famous line, Ã¢ÂÂAre you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?Ã¢ÂÂ Butterfield famously answered yes (as everyone already knew he would). It was ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs first star turn, a role that marked him in AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs minds as a righteous heavyweight prosecutor.

ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs own book suggests he wasnÃ¢ÂÂt exactly an impartial participant in the proceedings, however. He admits to leaking the news about the Butterfield discovery to NixonÃ¢ÂÂs lawyers without authorization. Transcripts from the Nixon Tapes also suggest Thompson was at least partially in NixonÃ¢ÂÂs pocket. As the Watergate Committee prepared to call Nixon aide John Dean, Nixon lawyer J. Fred Buzhardt coached Thompson on how to question Dean. Buzhardt told Nixon, Ã¢ÂÂI found Thompson most cooperative, feeling more Republican every day.Ã¢ÂÂ The next day, Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig reported to the president, Ã¢ÂÂHe [Thompson] thinks weÃ¢ÂÂre in good shape.Ã¢ÂÂ Of course, they were not. Not long after, Dean became the first Nixon aide to directly tie the president to the break-in and cover-up. But ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs reputation as a plain-speaking crusader for truth and justice had already been made.

ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs acting career also happened by accident. After parlaying his Watergate fame into big speaking fees and the start of a lucrative lobbying career (his clients included Westinghouse and the Tennessee savings-and-loans industry), Thompson returned to private practice in Tennessee. There, he wound up representing Marie Ragghianti, the head of the Tennessee Parole Board who was fired by Democratic governor Ray Blanton for exposing a parole-for-sale scheme. Ragghianti sued for wrongful dismissal, and Thompson won the case. Serpico author Peter Maas wrote a book about RagghiantiÃ¢ÂÂs story that was eventually optioned as a movie with Sissy Spacek slated to play the title role.

According to Thompson lore, director Roger Donaldson had to plead with Thompson to audition to play himself. Ã¢ÂÂThe idea of him playing himself was reached,Ã¢ÂÂ Donaldson told the Nashville Tennessean in May of this year. Ã¢ÂÂAnd so I said to Fred, Ã¢ÂÂWould you be interested at having a go at playing yourself?Ã¢ÂÂ He was like, Ã¢ÂÂShucks, do you think I could do that?Ã¢ÂÂ I said, Ã¢ÂÂYou never know until you try.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ

However, back in 1985, when the movie was made, Thompson freely admitted heÃ¢ÂÂd lobbied Donaldson hard until he scored an audition. Although the film wasnÃ¢ÂÂt especially successful, Thompson received raves, including one that described him as the movieÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂreal discovery.Ã¢ÂÂ

Bored with the law and in the process of getting a divorce from Lindsey, Thompson started work on a novel and began going on auditions. The book was never published, but within a few years, Thompson had become a Hollywood go-to guy for gruff government types, eventually playing a CIA director in No Way Out and a navy admiral in The Hunt for Red October. Most of his parts didnÃ¢ÂÂt take long to film, so Thompson kept his hand in the lobbying game. Tennessee insiders tried to persuade Thompson to run for the retiring BakerÃ¢ÂÂs seat in 1984, but he declined, quipping to the Washington Post, Ã¢ÂÂthe hassle factor is up and the pay is not.Ã¢ÂÂ

The day after his South Carolina speech in June, Thompson headed to New Hampshire for a bit of packaged politicking to be chronicled by the home team. With rare exceptions, Thompson has limited his media exposure to reliably conservative outlets like The Weekly Standard, Sean Hannity, and Fox News. This morning, Fox had the exclusive.

The first stop was RileyÃ¢ÂÂs gun shop, the largest rifle-and-pistol joint in New Hampshire. A few minutes after noon, two black SUVs barreled down the two-lane blacktop and were waved into the parking lot by a Thompson aide. The cars emptied, and Thompson emerged with Jeri. ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs blue suit was a torrent of wrinklesÃ¢ÂÂhe conjured up Ã¢ÂÂ60 Nixon more than Ã¢ÂÂ80 Reagan. His better half looked, well, better in a smart black suit that seemed a slight bit of overkill for a gun-and-ammo stop. They held hands and walked up a wheelchair-accessible ramp into RileyÃ¢ÂÂs, where two or three customers idly chatted with the help about the stability of this or that rifle scope.

Thompson glanced around at the 4,000 guns, and strode toward an employee. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve been looking into your record, and IÃ¢ÂÂm really looking forward to you getting into the race,Ã¢ÂÂ said Robert Brown, a 34-year-old salesman. Thompson beamed, pumped his hand, and told him, Ã¢ÂÂWe need to get back to basics.Ã¢ÂÂ

Fred and Jeri then made a loop of the store, pausing before a glass display case that could be used to showcase engagement rings. Here at RileyÃ¢ÂÂs, it housed a dozen glimmering Saturday night specials. Thompson lovingly nudged his spouse and tilted his noggin toward a coal-black .38 Smith & Wesson and cooed, Ã¢ÂÂHoney, would you like one of those?Ã¢ÂÂ

On the way out, I tried again to get Thompson to veer off-script. I jokingly asked him if he had more experience hunting than does Romney, who had been lampooned for saying he hunted varmints. As in a bad movie, time stopped for a second as I realized IÃ¢ÂÂd just set foot on a land mine of my own laying. Jeri beamed, and Fred halted his walk back to the car. He shot a look at the camera crewsÃ¢ÂÂFox had sent twoÃ¢ÂÂand waited a second for everyone to settle in again. This is why they made the visit: It was time to contrast the manÃ¢ÂÂs man Thompson with his effete competitors.

Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve got a little different eating habits,Ã¢ÂÂ joked Thompson. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve hunted pheasants, and I like to skeet shoot. WeÃ¢ÂÂd hold a celebrity skeet-shooting contest in Washington, raise money for juvenile diabetes. Now, IÃ¢ÂÂve held it, IÃ¢ÂÂve never won it. They couldnÃ¢ÂÂt slow those things down enough for me.Ã¢ÂÂ

The Fox crew nodded appreciatively. A moment later, the SUVs peeled away. The whole stop lasted far shorter than an episode of Law & Order, and was just as well-directed.

Thompson changed his mind about the Senate in 1993, when Al Gore was elected vice-president and his seat became open. ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs opponent was Congressman Jim Cooper, a moderate Democrat and the son of a former governor. At first, the candidates projected similar images of dark-suited blandness. Ã¢ÂÂI remember an early event at the Peabody hotel in Memphis,Ã¢ÂÂ says Mike Kopp, CooperÃ¢ÂÂs press secretary. Ã¢ÂÂCooper was a black hole of charisma: He didnÃ¢ÂÂt have any, and heÃ¢ÂÂd suck up yours. But Fred didnÃ¢ÂÂt come across as exactly electric.Ã¢ÂÂ

In May 1994, Thompson trailed badly and talked of quitting. Frustrated, he called Knoxville political consultant Tom Ingram, who had masterminded Lamar AlexanderÃ¢ÂÂs 1978 election as Tennessee governor. Alexander wasnÃ¢ÂÂt Mr. Personality either, but he caught fire when Ingram put him in a plaid shirt and had him walk across the state (a tactic, itÃ¢ÂÂs worth noting, that later bombed when Alexander ran for president). Thompson and Ingram met at a Cracker Barrel restaurant halfway between Nashville and Knoxville. Ã¢ÂÂHe was talking of getting out, and I asked him howÃ¢ÂÂd he want to do this,Ã¢ÂÂ remembers Ingram. Ã¢ÂÂFred said, Ã¢ÂÂJust driving around talking to people.Ã¢ÂÂ I said, Ã¢ÂÂWell, letÃ¢ÂÂs get you a truck and do it.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ

Although some of his campaign staff protested the move as cheesy, they leased Thompson a red Chevy pickup and he hit the road. Cooper attempted to paint Thompson as phony, calling him a Ã¢ÂÂGucci-wearing, Lincoln-driving, Perrier-drinking, Grey PouponÃ¢ÂÂspreading millionaire Washington special-interest lobbyist.Ã¢ÂÂ But voters loved the truck. They didnÃ¢ÂÂt seem to mind that the candidate often switched from a sedan to the truck just miles from his appearances. Ã¢ÂÂWe couldnÃ¢ÂÂt believe anyone was buying it,Ã¢ÂÂ says Kopp. Ã¢ÂÂWe underestimated him. What we didnÃ¢ÂÂt get is that Fred is the country version of a street kid. HeÃ¢ÂÂs been talking his way out of situations since he was in high school. HeÃ¢ÂÂs a charmer. People fall for it.Ã¢ÂÂ

Kopp and Ingram are friends, and Kopp expresses admiration for the consultantÃ¢ÂÂs work. Ã¢ÂÂFred Thompson was miscast at the beginning of the race,Ã¢ÂÂ Kopp says. Ã¢ÂÂSo Tom just recast the role, and Fred Thompson played it perfectly.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ingram disagrees. Ã¢ÂÂThe reason the truck worked is that that is Fred Thompson. Gimmicks fail in campaigns all the time because they donÃ¢ÂÂt ring true. Yeah, Fred is a lawyer and an actor, but he is also a country guy. People sense that.Ã¢ÂÂ

Thompson ended up winning by twenty points, partially aided by the Gingrich sweep of 1994. He drove the red truck to Washington where his old boss Baker threw a raucous party for him. According to The Washington Monthly, a gleeful Thompson mentioned that the craziness made him think of the party his fellow Tennessean Andrew Jackson had at the White House on the night of his inauguration.

Ã¢ÂÂOne office at a time,Ã¢ÂÂ cautioned Baker.

A few hours after the RileyÃ¢ÂÂs stop in Manchester, Thompson reappeared for a fund-raiser at BedfordÃ¢ÂÂs Wayfarer Inn, a hotel known for decades as a base for reporters boozing their way through the New Hampshire primaries. On this 90-degree summer scorcher, the air-conditioning in the small conference room where Thompson was supposed to greet high rollers was on the fritz. Not even JeriÃ¢ÂÂs perky smile and repeated recanting of Ã¢ÂÂHi, IÃ¢ÂÂm Jeri, and IÃ¢ÂÂm your official greeter tonightÃ¢ÂÂ could relieve the torpor.

After 45 minutes, Thompson emerged, covered in sweat and looking dangerously gray. For a moment, a Ã¢ÂÂWhat the hell have I got myself into?Ã¢ÂÂ look crossed his face. There was another, less exclusive fund-raiser just down the hall, packed with TV cameras (the Fox exclusive had been lifted), but Thompson bargained for some down time. Ã¢ÂÂGive me five minutes,Ã¢ÂÂ he asked. He didnÃ¢ÂÂt look like a man in game shape.

Twenty minutes later, a car drove him to the other side of the hotel, either to make his entrance grander or to save him the two-minute walk. After a brief introduction, Thompson took the microphone and talked about terrorism. He spoke in a reassuring, fatherly voice. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre confronted with a group of people who killed thousands of our people and would like nothing more than to get their hands on technology to kill millions,Ã¢ÂÂ Thompson said. Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂre getting ready to resume a war thatÃ¢ÂÂs been going on for hundreds of years, and they have another hundred-year plan. Some of our leaders got a plan for the next election,Ã¢ÂÂ he continued, presumably referring to those leaders who want to pull out of Iraq. Ã¢ÂÂAnd they think they can win votes out of it.Ã¢ÂÂ As a policy idea, it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt what one would call a breakthrough, nor was it much of an applause line. When Thompson talks about issues, his speeches tend to lose focus and drift.

But when the speech ended and the music blared, Thompson got in the Country Fred groove. He was doing the walk and talk, where he is most successful. Ã¢ÂÂKeep your powder dry,Ã¢ÂÂ Thompson told his fans. He paused mid-mob to answer a Franklin Pierce College poli-sci studentÃ¢ÂÂs question about entitlements. This time it was a TV reporter who ventured an unsanctioned question, asking Thompson whether he was a lazy man. Thompson didnÃ¢ÂÂt get angry; he just laughed. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs what they said about me before I ran the first time, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what they said about me two years later,Ã¢ÂÂ he replied. Ã¢ÂÂI won the first time by twenty points, and 21 points the second time. If you can do that while being lazy, I recommend it to everyone.Ã¢ÂÂ

the greatest testament to the power of Fred ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs down-home likability might be that his Senate years were widely viewed as a train wreck, yet he emerged not only unscathed but also as a presidential contender.

Things started auspiciously enough. Because Thompson had been elected to fill GoreÃ¢ÂÂs unexpired term, he was sworn in a month before other freshmen senators on December 9, 1994. Republicans didnÃ¢ÂÂt waste any time putting the actor in front of the cameras. On December 15, Thompson gave the RepublicansÃ¢ÂÂ response to President ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs budget address. Thompson spoke for only five minutes, but he struck a chord. A STAR IS BORN read the headline of Frank RichÃ¢ÂÂs New York Times column.

But that would be the high point. Thompson spent the next two years accomplishing almost nothing of significance other than raising money for his 1996 reelection: Thompson brought back the red truck and won in a walk.

While Bill Clinton easily trounced Bob Dole in that yearÃ¢ÂÂs presidential race, allegations surfaced that the Chinese government had funneled money into the Clinton campaign and that Al Gore had attended a fund-raiser at a Los Angeles Buddhist temple financed by foreign nationals. Thompson, chairman of the previously backwaterish Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which had jurisdiction, called for hearings.

In the weeks leading up to the hearings that July, the papers were filled with stories of ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs Watergate role and his prosecutorial flair. The DemocratsÃ¢ÂÂ ranking minority member was John Glenn, and the conventional wisdom was that Thompson would charm the octogenarian into submission. It didnÃ¢ÂÂt happen. Thompson condescended to Glenn and alienated members of his own party. When New Hampshire Republican Bob Smith announced in his opening statement, Ã¢ÂÂIt is probably the biggest scandal in the history of the Republic,Ã¢ÂÂ Thompson turned to the Democratic side, rolled his eyes, and muttered, Ã¢ÂÂJesus Christ.Ã¢ÂÂ

In 2005, Thompson donated his Senate papers to the University of Tennessee. Some of his archives are filled with notes of off-the-record interviews Thompson conducted with reporters during his Senate years. In his papers, Thompson complains about the trouble he had managing his colleagues during the 1996 hearings. He speaks of Ã¢ÂÂmembers on your [own] side, grilling your team to a point where [you have to] get them to a room, woodshed them, [on] how to ask questions, how to proceed.Ã¢ÂÂ

Thompson was also accused of grandstanding, and his relationship with then Republican Senate leaders Trent Lott and Mitch McConnell quickly soured. Soon Thompson was warring with both sides. Ã¢ÂÂ[We have] presidents at fund-raisers, Lott [saying] raising money is the American Way, [and] McConnell [is the] Darth Vader of Reform,Ã¢ÂÂ Thompson says in one of the off-the-record sessions found in his archives.

ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs hearings grew even more unpopular with his own party when he diverted the proceedings to the subject of campaign-finance reform (Senate Republicans opposed such reform for fear of losing hard-won fund-raising advantages). Lott was furious, and Thompson suspected the majority leader was the anonymous author of quotes criticizing the hearings.

The senator further angered conservatives by becoming an early supporter of the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance-reform legislation. Although Thompson has recently tried to minimize his enthusiasm for the bill, his Senate papers include a handwritten note from Senator Russell Feingold after the measure passed the Senate in 2001 reading, Ã¢ÂÂYou were essential to our success from the outset!Ã¢ÂÂ

ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs Senate years also featured a level of sympathy for Bill Clinton that conservatives donÃ¢ÂÂt tend to share. In 1995, ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs archives show, he sent Clinton a note after the State of the Union address that partially read, Ã¢ÂÂThe speech probably would not have seemed so long to some of us if you hadnÃ¢ÂÂt been putting the wood to us so effectively.Ã¢ÂÂ ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs 1999 split vote on ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs two counts of impeachment squared with one of his off-the-record sessions in 1998, when he told reporters, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm prejudiced in his favor, I object to the tactics used against him.Ã¢ÂÂ This didnÃ¢ÂÂt stop Thompson from sending Kenneth Starr a congratulations letter at the end of the Clinton saga.

Thompson may blast colleagues for not draining the Washington swamp, but he did his share of feeding the alligators. His papers include ingratiating notes to George Will, Arianna Huffington, and Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a mash note from Bruce Willis (Ã¢ÂÂYou were great in Die HardÃ¢ÂÂ) and a letter from Oliver Stone thanking Thompson for brokering an interview with Martin Luther King Jr. assassin James Earl Ray.

ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs off-the-record chats with reporters also suggest that his claim that he hasnÃ¢ÂÂt given much thought to running for president might be somewhat disingenuous (his campaign has attempted to make a virtue of the fact that Thompson, unlike his competitors, isnÃ¢ÂÂt obsessed with power). During one 1998 off-the-record bull session, Thompson boasted to a reporter, Ã¢ÂÂAl Gore goes to bed at night and says, Ã¢ÂÂPlease donÃ¢ÂÂt let it be Fred Dalton Thompson.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ

As a senator and movie star of a certain age, Thompson was a steadily sought-after D.C. bachelor. He alternately dated Lorrie Morgan, a five-times-married country-music star, Republican pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, former Time columnist Margaret Carlson, and Washington socialite Georgette Mosbacher. Ã¢ÂÂI chased a lot of women, and a lot of women chased me,Ã¢ÂÂ Thompson told Republican congressmen earlier this year. Ã¢ÂÂAnd those that chased me tended to catch me.Ã¢ÂÂ

ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs relationships with the Washington elite, romantic and otherwise, have paid significant dividends. This March, Carlson talked up ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs presidential possibilities on MSNBC, rhapsodizing, Ã¢ÂÂHeÃ¢ÂÂs handsome, heÃ¢ÂÂs charming, he sounds like a president, and he looks like a president.Ã¢ÂÂ She didnÃ¢ÂÂt disclose their prior personal relationship.

Thompson scored more gravitas points last month when Washington Post columnist and socialite Sally Quinn breathlessly wrote that Vice-President Dick Cheney was on his way out and should be replaced by, yes, Fred Thompson. Ã¢ÂÂEverybody loves Fred,Ã¢ÂÂ Quinn wrote. Ã¢ÂÂHe has the healing qualities of Gerald Ford and the movie-star appeal of Ronald Reagan.Ã¢ÂÂ For what itÃ¢ÂÂs worth, they both appeared in the 1994 remake of Born Yesterday.

Talking about his Senate years in July, Thompson said, Ã¢ÂÂWhen I served eight years, I left. I was following George WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂs model of serving eight years, getting on his horse, and never coming back.Ã¢ÂÂ

ItÃ¢ÂÂs only partially true. After 9/11, Thompson announced he would seek reelection the next year. But in January 2002, ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs daughter Betsy died of an accidental drug overdose, ending a long, troubled life. In March, Thompson withdrew his candidacy and sharply criticized the media coverage of BetsyÃ¢ÂÂs death. Ã¢ÂÂI simply do not have the heart for another six years,Ã¢ÂÂ he said at the time.

A few months before he left office, Thompson received a call. This time, his career angel was Law & Order creator Dick Wolf, who offered him the role of Arthur Branch over the phone. He immediately accepted. Thompson kept his hand in the lobbying game in 2004 by taking on Equitas Ltd., a British reinsurer responsible for paying out millions in asbestos claims. Equitas wanted Senate legislation that would limit its liability and paid Thompson $760,000 over the next three years. He also serves as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and in 2005 help shepherd Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts through his Senate confirmation hearings.

In 2002, Thompson married Jeri. The couple met in 1995 (Jeri was a Republican spokesperson at the time) on the Nashville yacht of Dale Gish, on the Fourth of July. Their relationship was on and off for years, with Kehn memorably complaining about other rivals to the New York Post in 2000. Ã¢ÂÂThey just wonÃ¢ÂÂt leave him alone,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂI canÃ¢ÂÂt get up to get a cocktail at a party without coming back and finding some girl sitting in my chair.Ã¢ÂÂ Fred and Jeri have since had two children, Hayden and an 8-month-old son named Samuel.

Last November, Thompson said he wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt run for president, telling a political dinner-party gathering, Ã¢ÂÂI would have had to start two years ago if I was going to run. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think IÃ¢ÂÂd ever want to jump back in.Ã¢ÂÂ

But with Giuliani, McCain, and Romney appearing vulnerable, Howard Baker began making calls around Washington to gauge the interest for a late-entering telegenic southern senator.

Or so the story goes. Some Republican insiders say it is Jeri who is fanning ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs presidential aspirations. While Ingram wonÃ¢ÂÂt confirm that, he does say Jeri played an influential role in the handling of her husbandÃ¢ÂÂs April announcement that he had non-HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs lymphoma, but is now in remission. The move was seen as a way of clearing the decks for a Thompson presidential run. Ã¢ÂÂHe relies on her,Ã¢ÂÂ Ingram says. Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂre definitely partners.Ã¢ÂÂ

To some, Jeri has already become a target. MSNBCÃ¢ÂÂs Joe Scarborough mused, Ã¢ÂÂYou think she works the pole?Ã¢ÂÂ and the New York Times Ã¢ÂÂStylesÃ¢ÂÂ section raised the question of whether America was ready for a trophy-wife Firs"	0

34	"With polls showing that President Obama is losing ground, The Post asked political experts what he could do to regain the initiative. Below are contributions from Scott Keeter, Michael S. Berman, Newt Gingrich, Donna Brazile, Robert J. Blendon, Christine Todd Whitman, Dan Schnur, Ed Rogers, Harold Ford Jr. and Ed Gillespie.

SCOTT KEETER

Director of survey research at Pew Research Center

President Obama had a better honeymoon with the public than either Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. But it's over now. His ratings are approaching his electoral margin.

This summer slump is a product of his own actions and political forces outside his control. Obama campaigned for strong government action on the economy and health care, and most of his voters agreed with this direction. But Obama's efforts to expand the role of government have alienated many of those who did not vote for him but nonetheless gave him high marks when first he took office.

Pew Research's political values survey this spring showed no surge in public demand for more government. Indeed, anti-government sentiment, which had been building for years, was heightened by the financial bailout and stimulus program. Moreover, it was inevitable that Obama eventually would have to take responsibility for the economy, which -- despite a few ""green shoots"" -- remains grim.

The health-care debate has taken a toll on the president's popularity as well as that of his party. Americans remain ambivalent, desiring most of the major elements in the reform proposals but simultaneously worrying about too much government control of health care. Obama can influence whether and how reform passes, and whether it passes at all will affect his approval rating. Democrats in Congress fear that passing an unpopular health care package will be politically costly, but as Clinton's 1994 experience demonstrated, they have good reason to fear that failure on health care could also be costly.

MICHAEL S. BERMAN

President of the Duberstein Group; former counsel and deputy chief of staff to Vice President Walter Mondale

First, the president should not over-read or over-rely on polls. To get some perspective, check out the Aug. 26 piece by Jeremy Rosner of Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner Research entitled ""A Pollster's Advice: Don't Trust the Polls on Health Reform's Demise.""

Second, Obama should show that he understands that people are being asked to accept changes in the health-care system while they are in the throes of actual or potential crisis in their personal financial ""systems."" And that he has heard the concerns raised by affected Americans nationwide. While the media attention to various town halls was in the best tradition of ""if it bleeds it leads,"" most of the people who came out did so out of a real need and interest to learn more about health-care reform proposals.

Third, invite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Harry Reid to a meeting, just the three of them, and work through with them a plan for going forward. Work ""with"" the congressional leadership to come up with a single bill that represents the doable, sans the wish list of every idea for changing health care that has been suggested in the past several decades. And get to that bill before the process kind of stumbles on to it.

Finally, choose a dramatic forum, perhaps a joint session of Congress, to lay out a bill that includes core changes but reflects having heard what is bothering the people he was elected to lead.

NEWT GINGRICH

Former Republican speaker of the House of Representatives

When he returns from vacation, the president's most important assignment should be to take a deep breath and get a long-term view of the country's reaction to his policies.

Since World War II, only Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton have had worse ratings after seven months than President Obama. His economic policies are not creating jobs. His energy tax is unlikely to pass the Senate. There is an overwhelming rejection of his spending policies.

On the international front, Afghanistan is proving much harder than expected. Iran is showing no signs of giving up its nuclear program and North Korea is still unyielding.

In this setting, the left's health program is bitterly dividing the country. Several polls have shown that more Americans expect their personal health-care situation to get worse than to get better under the plan being considered in Congress.

Still, Obama's left-wing advisers want him to undertake the revolutionary act of ramming through massive change for 17 percent of the economy under a narrow budgetary provision. This would be a statement of absolute defiance of the vast majority of Americans.

Obama faces a choice: He can attempt to run a left-wing government against the American people. Or he can govern from the center with a large majority of Americans supporting him. He can have either his left angry or the American people angry. We will know in September which choice he has made.

DONNA BRAZILE

Author and political commentator; manager of Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign

President Obama must reset the national debate and narrow his focus on passing health-insurance reform with or without Republicans. To do this, the president must convince deficit-weary voters that reform will not send the national debt soaring and that higher taxes on the middle class are not just around the corner.

With everything in his inbox still marked urgent, the president needs to prioritize more and stop trying to do everything at once without also reminding Americans of the sacrifices involved. He should repeat: ""Remember, we're all in this together.""

Obama must also take a chapter from his campaign and begin to work on the ""new politics"" that would allow him to reach bipartisan consensus on a host of major challenges.

Much of the real anger we are seeing is economic anxiety that ordinary people are experiencing in this jobless recession. The economy is doing better, according to statistics, but nobody feels it yet. That makes for a lot of fear and worry.

The administration should also keep an eye on the stimulus spending: target funds, track job creation, rebuild the safety net, and eliminate waste and duplicity. With money so tight, no one wants to see the government spending frivolously.

ROBERT J. BLENDON

Professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard's School of Public Health and its Kennedy School of Government

Most Americans do not see the president's economic policies as having been particularly successful for people like themselves, and this is leading to some skepticism about health-care reform. In fact, recent polls show most Americans do not anticipate any aspect of their health care improving if the president's health-reform proposals were enacted.

To shift this thinking requires two things: The administration's message has to change sharply, focusing on more concrete, practical aspects of reform and how it will improve typical Americans' experiences with health care. Obama needs to present over and over again five specific changes in the legislation that will help the average family, and how they will be paid for. For example, explain why changing the system so families cannot lose their insurance coverage and enacting tough insurance reforms helps families who have coverage today.

Second, the president needs to make a clear decision this fall about whether he supports a public option competing with private insurance. If so, he must explain how it would function in practice. Americans in the political center are turned off by ideological debates. After all these months, they want him to explain if it is essential and then move on to other issues they see as important.

CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN

Chair of the Republican Leadership Council; governor of New Jersey from 1994 to 2001

If he wants to regain ground on the health-care debate, climate change and the other legislative initiatives he has identified, President Obama needs to start by rebuilding some bridges within his party. The squabbling among Democrats is bitter, with the attacks from the more liberal end of the party on the more moderate ""Blue Dog"" Democrats reaching a fever pitch. Obama might keep in mind the legacy of Sen. Edward Kennedy and reach out to those Blue Dog Democrats as well as moderate Republicans to find common ground. Kennedy was an ardent partisan with a 90 percent liberal lifetime voting rating from the liberal watchdog group Americans for Democratic Action. No one questioned his commitment to the liberal agenda or his party. Yet few senators have ever authored more bipartisan bills and were known for so consistently reaching across the aisle. The president should refuse to push through legislation on strictly partisan votes and should seek the types of bipartisan compromise he promised to broker.

DAN SCHNUR

Director of the University of Southern California's Unruh Institute of Politics; communications director for John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign

Everyone is drawing political lessons from the life and legacy of Ted Kennedy. But there is one missed opportunity in particular from Kennedy's career that Barack Obama can reflect on to get himself and his administration back on track.

Kennedy famously cited his decision to reject President Richard Nixon's health-care reform package as his greatest regret. Although Nixon's proposal was not nearly as ambitious as Kennedy would have preferred, the senator realized over the years that working with Nixon would have led to significant advancements toward his larger goals.

Fast-forward to today's battle over health care. It's clear that Obama deserves credit for moving the debate forward and achieving consensus on a number of previously intractable issues. Set aside, for now, the brawls about end-of-life counseling and a publicly funded option. If Obama signed a bill that allows individuals who change jobs to keep their insurance, forbids the denial of coverage for preexisting conditions, and deals with a lifetime cap on benefits, people will throw rose petals at his feet.

Important progress can be made now on health care; after the most significant reforms in a generation are signed into law, he can still come back to the negotiating table and continue to move forward.

ED ROGERS

Chairman of BGR Group; White House staffer to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush

While the president's effectiveness is eroding, the situation is not dire. He can regain the initiative, but an eloquent speech won't do it. I assume he will not convert to conservatism and abandon his flawed plans, but he should cut his losses and get back to reality.

Occasionally all White Houses contort themselves into situations where they begin to say things they know are not true. The more you say such things, the more you have to keep saying them to try and make them true. But the Obama administration needs to face it: The president's energy bill is not a jobs bill! His health-care plans will lead to government bureaucratic decisions about individuals' heath care and will cost a fortune. The deficit is not under control. The administration should not deny the obvious or defend the indefensible. White House officials know they are losing the public debate on these issues and must scale back to what is possible and credible given America's economic circumstances -- or use brute force in Congress to pass unpopular, harmful and vast new programs.

Even if he did use his congressional majorities to win these battles, the president would lose the war by slowing economic growth, only resulting in more political pain for himself and his party. Obama doesn't have any political problems that a couple of years of 4 percent GDP growth won't solve. But he has to want it, and he needs honest policies to achieve it. Now, though, he is on a course that terrifies his political handlers and his party's candidates.

HAROLD FORD JR.

Chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council

Every president faces a time when poll numbers slide. It's easy to advise a president to ignore the numbers and plow ahead. It's not wise for a president to heed that advice blindly. Thankfully, President Obama knows that politics is about the art of the possible.

Obama is battling a stubborn recession, a Republican Congress hell-bent on defeating health reform and a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan. When he returns to Washington the president should forge a consensus in Congress to pass what ""is possible"" on health reform, redouble his efforts to stimulate job creation, clearly articulate our mission objectives in Afghanistan, and redefine and revive energy and financial services reform.

First he needs to win on health reform. Obama has been patient, committed and focused on leading Congress to a consensus. At his core, this president is a pragmatist. In the spirit of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, Obama should work toward winning a compromise here before taking on new reform challenges.

The compromise should be built around insurance reform, such as prohibiting companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions, and guaranteeing coverage for every child in America. Such substantive health reform would put us firmly on path to solving the uninsured problem in this country when our economy gets back on track.

ED GILLESPIE

Counselor to President George W. Bush

Barack Obama faces a fundamental decision about the direction of his presidency: Try to muscle through with Democratic votes a much more liberal agenda than many of his voters expected of him, or seek more consensus-oriented policies that attract at least a slice of the House and Senate Republicans by sacrificing core liberal elements of his policies.

If he chooses the former, he risks spectacular failure or a victory that eliminates the ""postpartisan"" persona that is a critical component of his personal approval ratings. This would make it much more difficult to achieve future legislative goals, in the same way the rushed, forced passage of the stimulus bill has made his health-care policy harder to achieve. And once that critical attribute is lost, it's all but impossible to get back.

To pull his young presidency back from the brink, and protect his greatest asset, President Obama would be wise to tack back to the center and pull his congressional leadership with him. He can then return his focus to the central issue on which voters are looking to him for leadership -- turning our economy around."	0
35	"Under attack at a recent debate from rival Hillary Clinton on health care, Barack Obama shot back:

""Well, let's talk about health care right now because the fact of the matter is that I do provide universal health care. The only difference between Sen. Clinton's health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated Ã¢ÂÂ forced Ã¢ÂÂ them to get health care.""

Before jumping into this fray, it's important to note that when it comes to health care, the two Democratic presidential candidates have a lot in common.

One of the few differences is that Clinton includes a universal mandate. That means that after everything else goes according to plan, individuals will be required by law to purchase insurance. Think of how people are required to buy auto insurance and you get an idea of what that might look like.

Obama's plan includes a mandate to insure children, but it does not include a mandate for adults, as the Clinton and Edwards plans do. That likely means not as many people will be insured, said Kenneth Thorpe, professor of health policy and management at Emory University.

Obama's decision not to include a mandate is a more cautious approach, one Obama says is designed not to penalize people with modest incomes. If premiums don't drop enough after all the reforms are implemented, people will still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won't. Obama's argument is that if you then fine them, you're essentially punishing the poor Ã¢ÂÂ and they will still be uninsured. Obama is betting that his plan will get costs low enough that many of the estimated 47-million uninsured will sign up without a mandate, and a mandate will come later.

So is it fair for Obama to call his plan ""universal""? Well, not really. Even if you buy his argument that his plan will create the market conditions to make health care universally available, nothing in his plan guarantees it. We rate his claim Barely True."	0
36	"Whoopi Goldberg is in hot water after comments she made Wednesday regarding the Navy SEAL widow that was honored last night during President Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs historical speech.

Ã¢ÂÂShe was just looking for attention. These military widows love their 15 minutes in the spotlightÃ¢ÂÂ, Goldberg said.

Ã¢ÂÂIf it were me I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be able to leave the house. How can someone who is truly greiving go out there and be on TV. It just doesnÃ¢ÂÂt make sense to meÃ¢ÂÂ

After last nightÃ¢ÂÂs demonstration where several democrats in leadership roles refused to stand while the widow was being honored, Goldberg continues to make the point that liberals lack a significant amount of class.

THE PRESIDENT: Hello, El Paso! (Applause.) Well, it is wonderful -- wonderful to be back with all of you in the Lone Star State. (Applause.) Everything is bigger in Texas. (Applause.)



AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!



THE PRESIDENT: I love you back! (Applause.) Even the welcomes are bigger. (Applause.) So, in appreciation, I wanted to give a big policy speech outside on a really hot day. (Laughter.) Those of you who are still wearing your jackets, feel free to take them off. I hope everybody is wearing sunscreen.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: We live here.



THE PRESIDENT: You say you live here? You donÃ¢ÂÂt need it, huh? (Laughter.) Well, it is a great honor to be here. And I want to express my appreciation to all of you for taking the time to come out today.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!



THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. (Applause.)



You know, about a week ago, I delivered a commencement address at Miami Dade Community College, which is one of the most diverse schools in the nation. The graduates were proud that their class could claim heritage from 181 countries around the world -- 181 countries. (Applause.)



Many of the students were immigrants themselves, coming to America with little more than the dream of their parents and the clothes on their back. A handful had discovered only in adolescence or adulthood that they were undocumented. But they worked hard and they gave it their all, and so they earned those diplomas.



And at the ceremony, 181 flags -- one for every nation that was represented -- was marched across the stage. And each one was applauded by the graduates and the relatives with ties to those countries. So when the Haitian flag went by, all the Haitian kids -- Haitian American kids shouted out. And when the Guatemalan flag went by, all the kids of Guatemalan heritage shouted out. And when the Ukrainian flag went by, I think one kid shouted out. (Laughter.) This was down in Miami. (Laughter.) If it had been in Chicago, there would have been more.



But then, the last flag, the American flag, came into view. And everyone in the room erupted in applause. Everybody cheered. (Applause.) So, yes, their parents and grandparents -- some of the graduates themselves -- had come from every corner of the globe. But it was here that they had found opportunity. It was here that they had a chance to contribute to the nation that is their home.



And it was a reminder of a simple idea, as old as America itself: E pluribus unum. Out of many, one. We define ourselves as a nation of immigrants -- a nation that welcomes those willing to embrace AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs ideals and AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs precepts. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why millions of people, ancestors to most of us, braved hardship and great risk to come here -- so they could be free to work and worship and start a business and live their lives in peace and prosperity. The Asian immigrants who made their way to CaliforniaÃ¢ÂÂs Angel Island. The German and Scandinavians who settled across the Midwest. The waves of Irish, and Italian, and Polish, and Russian, and Jewish immigrants who leaned against the railing to catch their first glimpse of the Statue of Liberty.



This flow of immigrants has helped make this country stronger and more prosperous. (Applause.) We can point to the genius of Einstein, the designs of I. M. Pei, the stories of Isaac Asimov, the entire industries that were forged by Andrew Carnegie.



And then when I think about immigration I think about the naturalization ceremonies that weÃ¢ÂÂve held at the White House for members of our military. Nothing could be more inspiring. Even though they were not yet citizens when they joined our military, these men and women signed up to serve.



We did one event at the White House and a young man named Granger Michael from Papua New Guinea, a Marine who had been deployed to Iraq three times, was there. And you know what he said about becoming an American citizen? He said, Ã¢ÂÂI might as well. I love this country already.Ã¢ÂÂ ThatÃ¢ÂÂs all he said. Marines arenÃ¢ÂÂt big on speeches. (Laughter.)



Another was a woman named Perla Ramos who was born and raised in Mexico and came to the United States shortly after 9/11, and joined the Navy. And she said, Ã¢ÂÂI take pride in our flag and the history we write day by day.Ã¢ÂÂ



ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the promise of this country -- that anyone can write the next chapter in our story. It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt matter where you come from -- (applause) -- it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt matter where you come from; it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt matter what you look like; it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt matter what faith you worship. What matters is that you believe in the ideals on which we were founded; that you believe that all of us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. (Applause.) All of us deserve our freedoms and our pursuit of happiness. In embracing America, you can become American. That is what makes this country great. That enriches all of us.



And yet, at the same time, weÃ¢ÂÂre here at the border today -- (applause) -- weÃ¢ÂÂre here at the border because we also recognize that being a nation of laws goes hand in hand with being a nation of immigrants. This, too, is our heritage. This, too, is important. And the truth is, weÃ¢ÂÂve often wrestled with the politics of who is and who isnÃ¢ÂÂt allowed to come into this country. This debate is not new.



At times, there has been fear and resentment directed towards newcomers, especially in hard economic times. And because these issues touch deeply on what we believe, touch deeply on our convictions -- about who we are as a people, about what it means to be an American -- these debates often elicit strong emotions.



ThatÃ¢ÂÂs one reason itÃ¢ÂÂs been so difficult to reform our broken immigration system. When an issue is this complex, when it raises such strong feelings, itÃ¢ÂÂs easier for politicians to defer until the problem the next election. And thereÃ¢ÂÂs always a next election.



So weÃ¢ÂÂve seen a lot of blame and a lot of politics and a lot of ugly rhetoric around immigration. And weÃ¢ÂÂve seen good faith efforts from leaders of both parties -- by the way, I just noticed, those of you who have chairs, if you want to sit down, feel free. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no rule about having to stand when IÃ¢ÂÂm --



AUDIENCE MEMBER: -- we love you! (Applause.)



THE PRESIDENT: But weÃ¢ÂÂve seen leaders of both parties who try to work on this issue, but then their efforts fell prey to the usual Washington games. And all the while, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen the mounting consequences of decades of inaction.



Today, there are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants here in the United States. Some crossed the border illegally. Others avoid immigration laws by overstaying their visas. Regardless of how they came, the overwhelming majority of these folks are just trying to earn a living and provide for their families. (Applause.)



But we have to acknowledge theyÃ¢ÂÂve broken the rules. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve cut in front of the line. And what is also true is that the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are trying to immigrate legally.



Also, because undocumented immigrants live in the shadows, where theyÃ¢ÂÂre vulnerable to unscrupulous businesses that skirt taxes, and pay workers less than the minimum wage, or cut corners with health and safety laws, this puts companies who follow the rules, and Americans who rightly demand the minimum wage or overtime or just a safe place to work, it puts those businesses at a disadvantage.



Think about it. Over the past decade, even before the recession hit, middle-class families were struggling to get by as the costs went up for everything, from health care, to college tuition, to groceries, to gas. Their incomes didnÃ¢ÂÂt go up with those prices. WeÃ¢ÂÂre seeing it again right now with gas prices.



So one way to strengthen the middle class in America is to reform the immigration system so that there is no longer a massive underground economy that exploits a cheap source of labor while depressing wages for everybody else. I want incomes for middle-class families to rise again. (Applause.) I want prosperity in this country to be widely shared. (Applause.) I want everybody to be able to reach that American dream. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why immigration reform is an economic imperative. ItÃ¢ÂÂs an economic imperative. (Applause.)



And reform will also help to make America more competitive in the global economy. Today, we provide students from around the world with visas to get engineering and computer science degrees at our top universities. (Applause.)



But then our laws discourage them from using those skills to start a business or a new industry here in the United States. Instead of training entrepreneurs to stay here, we train them to create jobs for our competition. That makes no sense. In a global marketplace, we need all the talent we can attract, all the talent we can get to stay here to start businesses -- not just to benefit those individuals, but because their contribution will benefit all Americans.



Look at Intel, look at Google, look at Yahoo, look at eBay. All those great American companies, all the jobs theyÃ¢ÂÂve created, everything that has helped us take leadership in the high-tech industry, every one of those was founded by, guess who, an immigrant. (Applause.)



So we donÃ¢ÂÂt want the next Intel or the next Google to be created in China or India. We want those companies and jobs to take root here. (Applause.) Bill Gates gets this. He knows a little something about the high-tech industry. He said, Ã¢ÂÂThe United States will find it far more difficult to maintain its competitive edge if it excludes those who are able and willing to help us compete.Ã¢ÂÂ



So immigration is not just the right thing to do. ItÃ¢ÂÂs smart for our economy. ItÃ¢ÂÂs smart for our economy. (Applause.) And itÃ¢ÂÂs for this reason that businesses all across America are demanding that Washington finally meet its responsibilities to solve the immigration problem. Everybody recognizes the system is broken. The question is, will we finally summon the political will to do something about it? And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why weÃ¢ÂÂre here at the border today.



And I want to say I am joined today by an outstanding Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, whoÃ¢ÂÂs been working tirelessly on this issue. (Applause.) Our commissioner whoÃ¢ÂÂs working diligently on border issues, Alan Bersin, is there, and we appreciate him -- Bersin. (Applause.)



So theyÃ¢ÂÂre doing outstanding work. And in recent years, among one of the greatest impediments to reform were questions about border security. And these were legitimate concerns. What was true was a lack of manpower and a lack of resources at the border, combined with the pull of jobs and ill-considered enforcement once folks were in the country.



All this contributed to a growing number of undocumented people living in the United States. And these concerns helped unravel a bipartisan coalition that we had forged back when I was in the United States Senate. So in the years since, Ã¢ÂÂborders first, borders first,Ã¢ÂÂ that's become the common refrain, even among those who were previously supportive of comprehensive immigration reform.



But over the last two years, thanks to the outstanding work of Janet and Alan and everybody whoÃ¢ÂÂs down here working at the border, weÃ¢ÂÂve answered those concerns. Under their leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible. They wanted more agents at the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history. (Applause.)



The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents -- more than twice as many as there were in 2004. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a build-up that began under President Bush and that weÃ¢ÂÂve continued, and I had a chance to meet some of these outstanding agents, and actually saw some of them on horseback who looked pretty tough. (Laughter.) So we put the agents here.



Then they wanted a fence. Well, the fence is --



AUDIENCE: Booo!



THE PRESIDENT: The fence is now basically complete.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: Tear it down!



THE PRESIDENT: Then weÃ¢ÂÂve gone further. We tripled the number of intelligence analysts working at the border. IÃ¢ÂÂve deployed unmanned aerial vehicles to patrol the skies from Texas to California. We have forged a partnership with Mexico to fight the transnational criminal organizations that have affected both of our countries. (Applause.) And for the first time -- for the first time weÃ¢ÂÂre screening 100 percent of southbound rail shipments to seize guns and money going south even as we go after drugs that are coming north. (Applause.)



So, hereÃ¢ÂÂs the point. I want everybody to listen carefully to this. We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement. All the stuff they asked for, weÃ¢ÂÂve done. But even though weÃ¢ÂÂve answered these concerns, IÃ¢ÂÂve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: TheyÃ¢ÂÂre racist!



THE PRESIDENT: You know, they said we needed to triple the Border Patrol. Or now theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to say we need to quadruple the Border Patrol. Or theyÃ¢ÂÂll want a higher fence. Maybe theyÃ¢ÂÂll need a moat. (Laughter.) Maybe they want alligators in the moat. (Laughter.) TheyÃ¢ÂÂll never be satisfied. And I understand that. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs politics.



But the truth is the measures weÃ¢ÂÂve put in place are getting results. Over the past two and a half years, weÃ¢ÂÂve seized 31 percent more drugs, 75 percent more currency, 64 percent more weapons than ever before. (Applause.) And even as we have stepped up patrols, apprehensions along the border have been cut by nearly 40 percent from two years ago. That means far fewer people are attempting to cross the border illegally.



And also, despite a lot of breathless reports that have tagged places like El Paso as dangerous, violent crime in southwest border counties has dropped by a third. El Paso and other cities and towns along this border are consistently among the safest in the nation. (Applause.) Of course, we shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt accept any violence or crime. And weÃ¢ÂÂve always got more work to do. But this progress is important and itÃ¢ÂÂs not getting reported on.



And weÃ¢ÂÂre also going beyond the border. Beyond the border, weÃ¢ÂÂre going after employers who knowingly exploit people and break the law. (Applause.) And we are deporting those who are here illegally. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs a tough issue. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a source of controversy.



But I want to emphasize weÃ¢ÂÂre not doing it haphazardly. WeÃ¢ÂÂre focusing our limited resources and people on violent offenders and people convicted of crimes -- not just families, not just folks who are just looking to scrape together an income. And as a result, weÃ¢ÂÂve increased the removal of criminals by 70 percent. (Applause.)



ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not to ignore the real human toll of a broken immigration system. Even as we recognize that enforcing the law is necessary, we donÃ¢ÂÂt relish the pain that it causes in the lives of people who are just trying to get by and get caught up in the system.



And as long as the current laws are on the books, itÃ¢ÂÂs not just hardened felons who are subject to removal, but sometimes families who are just trying to earn a living, or bright, eager students, or decent people with the best of intentions. (Applause.)



And sometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But thatÃ¢ÂÂs not how a democracy works. What we really need to do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine, comprehensive reform. That is the ultimate solution to this problem. That's what IÃ¢ÂÂm committed to doing. (Applause.)



AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, we can! Yes, we can!



THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we can. We can do it. (Applause.)



AUDIENCE: Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!



THE PRESIDENT: The most significant step we can now take to secure the borders is to fix the system as a whole so that fewer people have the incentive to enter illegally in search of work in the first place. This would allow agents to focus on the worst threats on both of our -- both sides of our borders, from drug traffickers to those who would come here to commit acts of violence or terror. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs where our focus should be.



So, El Paso, the question is whether those in Congress who previously walked away in the name of enforcement are now ready to come back to the table and finish the work that weÃ¢ÂÂve started. (Applause.) WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to put the politics aside. And if we do, IÃ¢ÂÂm confident we can find common ground.



Washington is lagging behind the country on this. There is already a growing coalition of leaders across America who donÃ¢ÂÂt always see eye-to-eye, but are coming together on this issue. They see the harmful consequences of a broken immigration system for their businesses and for their communities, and they understand why we need to act.



There are Democrats and Republicans, people like former Republican Senator Mel Martinez; former Bush administration Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff; leaders like Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York; evangelical ministers like Leith Anderson and Bill Hybels; police chiefs from across the nation; educators; advocates; labor unions; chambers of commerce; small business owners; Fortune 500 CEOs.



I mean, one CEO had this to say about reform: Ã¢ÂÂAmerican ingenuity is a product of the openness and diversity of this society. Immigrants have made America great as the world leader in business, in science, higher education and innovation.Ã¢ÂÂ You know who that leader was? Rupert Murdoch, who owns FOX News, and is an immigrant himself. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know if youÃ¢ÂÂre familiar with Rupert MurdochÃ¢ÂÂs views, but letÃ¢ÂÂs just say he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have an Obama sticker on his car. (Laughter.) But he agrees with me on this. (Applause.)



So there is a consensus around fixing whatÃ¢ÂÂs broken. And now we need Congress to catch up. Now we need to come together around reform that reflects our values as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants; reform that demands that everybody take responsibility. So what would comprehensive reform look like?



First, we know that government has a threshold responsibility to secure our borders and enforce the law. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs what Janet and all her folks are doing. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what theyÃ¢ÂÂre doing. (Applause.)



Second, businesses have to be held accountable if they exploit undocumented workers. (Applause.)



Third, those who are here illegally, they have a responsibility as well. So they broke the law, and that means theyÃ¢ÂÂve got to pay their taxes, theyÃ¢ÂÂve got to pay a fine, theyÃ¢ÂÂve got to learn English. And theyÃ¢ÂÂve got to undergo background checks and a lengthy process before they get in line for legalization. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not too much to ask. (Applause.)



And fourth, stopping illegal immigration also depends on reforming our outdated system of legal immigration. (Applause.) We should make it easier for the best and the brightest to not only stay here, but also to start businesses and create jobs here. In recent years, a full 25 percent of high-tech startups in the U.S. were founded by immigrants. That led to 200,000 jobs here in America. IÃ¢ÂÂm glad those jobs are here. I want to see more of them created in this country. We need to provide them the chance. (Applause.)



We need to provide our farms a legal way to hire workers that they rely on, and a path for those workers to earn legal status. (Applause.) And our laws should respect families following the rules -- reuniting them more quickly instead of splitting them apart. (Applause.)



Today, the immigration system not only tolerates those who break the rules, but it punishes folks who follow the rules. While applications -- while applicants wait for approval, for example, theyÃ¢ÂÂre often forbidden from visiting the United States. Even husbands and wives may have to spend years apart. Parents canÃ¢ÂÂt see their children. I donÃ¢ÂÂt believe the United States of America should be in the business of separating families. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not right. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not who we are. We can do better than that. (Applause.)



And we should stop punishing innocent young people for the actions of their parents. (Applause.) We should stop denying them the chance to earn an education or serve in the military. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why we need to pass the DREAM Act. (Applause.) Now, we passed the DREAM Act through the House last year when Democrats were in control. But even though it received a majority of votes in the Senate, it was blocked when several Republicans who had previously supported the DREAM Act voted no.



That was a tremendous disappointment to get so close and then see politics get in the way. And as I gave that commencement at Miami Dade, it broke my heart knowing that a number of those promising, bright students -- young people who worked so hard and who speak about whatÃ¢ÂÂs best in America -- are at risk of facing the agony of deportation. These are kids who grew up in this country. They love this country. They know no other place to call home. The idea that weÃ¢ÂÂd punish them is cruel. It makes no sense. WeÃ¢ÂÂre a better nation than that. (Applause.)



So weÃ¢ÂÂre going to keep fighting for the DREAM Act. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to keep up the fight for reform. (Applause.) And thatÃ¢ÂÂs where you come in. IÃ¢ÂÂm going to do my part to lead a constructive and civil debate on these issues. And weÃ¢ÂÂve already had a series of meetings about this at the White House in recent weeks. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got leaders here and around the country helping to move the debate forward.



But this change ultimately has to be driven by you, the American people. YouÃ¢ÂÂve got to help push for comprehensive reform, and youÃ¢ÂÂve got to identify what steps we can take right now -- like the DREAM Act, like visa reform -- areas where we can find common ground among Democrats and Republicans and begin to fix whatÃ¢ÂÂs broken.



So IÃ¢ÂÂm asking you to add your voices to this debate. You can sign up to help at whitehouse.gov. We need Washington to know that there is a movement for reform thatÃ¢ÂÂs gathering strength from coast to coast. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs how weÃ¢ÂÂll get this done. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs how we can ensure that in the years ahead we are welcoming the talents of all who can contribute to this country and that weÃ¢ÂÂre living up to the basic American idea that you can make it here if you try. (Applause.)



ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the idea that gave hope to JosÃÂ© HernÃÂ¡ndez. Is JosÃÂ© here? WhereÃ¢ÂÂs -- JosÃÂ© is right over there. (Applause.) I want you to hear -- I want you to think about this story. JosÃÂ©Ã¢ÂÂs parents were migrant farm workers. And so, growing up, he was too. He was born in California, though he could have just as easily been born on the other side of the border, if it had been a different time of year, because his family moved around with the seasons. So two of his siblings were actually born in Mexico.



So they traveled a lot, and JosÃÂ© joined his parents picking cucumbers and strawberries. And he missed part of school when they returned to Mexico each winter. JosÃÂ© didnÃ¢ÂÂt learn English until he was 12 years old. But you know what, JosÃÂ© was good at math and he liked math. And the nice thing is that math was the same in every school, and itÃ¢ÂÂs the same in Spanish as it is in English.



So JosÃÂ© studied, and he studied hard. And one day, heÃ¢ÂÂs standing in the fields, collecting sugar beets, and he heard on a transistor radio that a man named Franklin Chang-Diaz -- a man with a surname like his -- was going to be an astronaut for NASA. So JosÃÂ© decided -- right there in the field, he decided -- well, I could be an astronaut, too.



So JosÃÂ© kept on studying, and he graduated high school. And he kept on studying, and he earned an engineering degree. And he kept on studying, and he earned a graduate degree. And he kept on working hard, and he ended up at a national laboratory, helping to develop a new kind of digital medical imaging system.



And a few years later, he found himself more than 100 miles above the surface of the Earth, staring out of the window of the shuttle Discovery, and he was remembering the boy in the California fields with that crazy dream that in America everything is possible. (Applause.)



Think about that, El Paso. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the American Dream right there. (Applause.) That's what weÃ¢ÂÂre fighting for. We are fighting for every boy and every girl like JosÃÂ© with a dream and potential that's just waiting to be tapped. We are fighting to unlock that promise, and all that holds not just for their futures, but for AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs future. That's why weÃ¢ÂÂre going to get this done. And that's why IÃ¢ÂÂm going to need your help.



Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

Democrat House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi suffered what her staff is calling a Ã¢ÂÂbreakdownÃ¢ÂÂ this morning and was transferred via ambulance to Bethesda. Rear-Admiral Thomas Phillip McCrakken, head of psychiatry, said Pelosi shows signs of a psychotic break from reality that a woman her age may never recover from:

Ã¢ÂÂMrs. Pelosi is in an advanced stage of disengagement from reality. SheÃ¢ÂÂs under the impression that Democrats still have say in how our country is governed, for example, which is, quite frankly, just silly. She also believes, as she told me personally just yesterday, that Barack Obama is coming back to lead us into midterms where he will win the White House and she will be Speaker again.Ã¢ÂÂ

Well thatÃ¢ÂÂs just sad. While Obama will probably hit the campaign trail pretty hard for the Democrats in 2018, there wonÃ¢ÂÂt be any winning for them. TheyÃ¢ÂÂll continue to lose until they figure out how to shut down the will of the people the likes of whom frequent websites like ours.

Real Patriots who love their president. No. Matter. What."	1

MR. DORSEY: Good afternoon and welcome to the White House. I am Jack Dorsey, from Twitter.



Through more than 200 million tweets per day, people around the world use Twitter to instantly connect to what's most meaningful to them. In every country -- Egypt and Japan, the UK and the United States -- much of this conversation is made up of everyday people engaging in spirited debate about the future of their countries.



Our partners at Salesforce Radian6 studied more than a million tweets, discussing our nation's politics over the recent weeks, and they found that America's financial security to be one of the most actively talked about topics on Twitter. They further found that President Obama's name comes up in more than half of these conversations.



And so today this vibrant discussion comes here to the White House and you get to ask the questions. To participate, just open your web browser and go to askObama.Twitter.com. Neither the President or I know the questions that will be asked today. That decision is driven entirely by the Twitter users.



And so let's get the conversation started. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. (Applause.)



THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody! (Applause.) First of all, everybody can sit down. (Laughter.) It's much easier to tweet from a seated position. (Laughter.)



MR. DORSEY: And I understand you want to start the conversation off with a tweeter yourself.



THE PRESIDENT: I'm going to make history here as the first President to live tweet. So we've got a computer over here. (Types in tweet.)



MR. DORSEY: It's only 140 characters. (Laughter.)



THE PRESIDENT: All right, I think I have done this properly. But here's the test.



MR. DORSEY: And you tweeted.



THE PRESIDENT: How about that? Not bad. (Applause.) Thank you. So I think my question will be coming up at some point.



MR. DORSEY: So what was your question? Here it is.



THE PRESIDENT: Here's the question: ""In order to reduce the deficit, what costs would you cut and what investments would you keep?""



And the reason I thought this was an important question is, as all of you know, we are going through a spirited debate here in Washington, but it's important to get the whole country involved, in making a determination about what are the programs that can help us grow, can create jobs, improve our education system, maintain our clean air and clean water, and what are those things that are a waste that we shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be investing in because they're not helping us grow or create jobs or creating new businesses. And that debate is going to be heating up over the next couple of weeks, so I'd love to hear from the American people, see what thoughts they have.



MR. DORSEY: Excellent. Well, first question comes from a curator in New Hampshire. And we have eight curators around the country helping us pick tweets from the crowd so that we can read them to the President.



And this one comes from William Smith: ""What mistakes have you made in handling this recession and what would you do differently?""



THE PRESIDENT: That's a terrific question. When I first came into office we were facing the worst recession since the Great Depression. So, looking around this room, it's a pretty young room -- it's certainly the worst recession that we've faced in our lifetimes. And we had to act quickly and make some bold and sometimes difficult decisions.



It was absolutely the right thing to do to put forward a Recovery Act that cut taxes for middle-class folks so they had more money in their pocket to get through the recession. It was the right thing to do to provide assistance to states to make sure that they didnÃ¢ÂÂt have to lay off teachers and cops and firefighters as quickly as they needed to. And it was the right thing to do to try to rebuild our infrastructure and put people back to work building roads and bridges and so forth.



It also was the right thing to do, although a tough decision, to save the auto industry, which is now profitable and gaining market share -- the U.S. auto industry -- for the first time in a very long time.



I think that -- probably two things that I would do differently. One would have been to explain to the American people that it was going to take a while for us to get out of this. I think even I did not realize the magnitude, because most economists didnÃ¢ÂÂt realize the magnitude, of the recession until fairly far into it, maybe two or three months into my presidency where we started realizing that we had lost 4 million jobs before I was even sworn in.



And so I think people may not have been prepared for how long this was going to take and why we were going to have to make some very difficult decisions and choices. And I take responsibility for that, because setting peopleÃ¢ÂÂs expectations is part of how you end up being able to respond well.



The other area is in the area of housing. I think that the continuing decline in the housing market is something that hasnÃ¢ÂÂt bottomed out as quickly as we expected. And so thatÃ¢ÂÂs continued to be a big drag on the economy.



WeÃ¢ÂÂve had to revamp our housing program several times to try to help people stay in their homes and try to start lifting home values up. But of all the things weÃ¢ÂÂve done, thatÃ¢ÂÂs probably been the area thatÃ¢ÂÂs been most stubborn to us trying to solve the problem.



MR. DORSEY: Mr. President, 27 percent of our questions are in the jobs category, as you can see from the screen over here. Our next question has to do about jobs and technology. It comes from David: ""Tech and knowledge industries are thriving, yet jobs discussion always centers on manufacturing. Why not be realistic about jobs?""



THE PRESIDENT: Well, itÃ¢ÂÂs not an either/or question; itÃ¢ÂÂs a both/and question. We have to be successful at the cutting-edge industries of the future like Twitter. But we also have always been a country that makes stuff. And manufacturing jobs end up having both higher wages typically, and they also have bigger multiplier effects. So one manufacturing job can support a range of other jobs -- suppliers and the restaurant near the plant and so forth. So they end up having a substantial impact on the overall economy.



What we want to focus on is advanced manufacturing that combines new technology, so research and development to figure out how are we going to create the next Twitter, how are we going to create the next Google, how are we going to create the next big thing -- but make sure that production is here.



So itÃ¢ÂÂs great that we have an Apple thatÃ¢ÂÂs creating iPods, iPads and designing them and creating the software, but it would be nice if weÃ¢ÂÂre also making the iPads and the iPods here in the United States, because that's some more jobs that people can work at.



And there are going to be a series of decisions that weÃ¢ÂÂve got to make. Number one, are we investing in research and development in order to emphasize technology? And a lot of that has to come from government. That's how the Internet got formed. That's how GPS got formed. Companies on their own canÃ¢ÂÂt always finance the basic research because they canÃ¢ÂÂt be assured that theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to get a return on it.



Number two, weÃ¢ÂÂve got to drastically improve how we train our workforce and our kids around math and science and technology.



Number three, weÃ¢ÂÂve got to have a top-notch infrastructure to support advanced manufacturing, and weÃ¢ÂÂve got to look at sectors where we know this is going to be the future. Something like clean energy, for example. For us not to be the leaders in investing in clean energy manufacturing so that wind turbines and solar panels are not only designed here in the United States but made here in the United States makes absolutely no sense. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to invest in those areas for us to be successful.



So you can combine high-tech with manufacturing, and then you get the best of all worlds.



MR. DORSEY: You mentioned education. There's a lot of questions coming about education and its impact on the economy. This one in particular is from a curator who is pulling from a student in Ohio, named Dustin: ""Higher ed is necessary for a stronger economy, but for some middle-class Americans itÃ¢ÂÂs becoming too expensive. What can be done?""



THE PRESIDENT: Well, here is some good news. WeÃ¢ÂÂve already done something that is very significant, and people may not know. As part of a higher education package that we passed last year, what we were able to do was to take away subsidies that were going to banks for serving as middlemen in the student loan program and funnel that to help young people, through Pell Grants and lower rates on student loans. And so there are millions of students who are getting more affordable student loans and grants as a consequence of the steps that weÃ¢ÂÂve already taken. This is about tens of billions of dollars' worth of additional federal dollars that were going to banks are now going to students directly.



In addition, what weÃ¢ÂÂve said is that starting in 2013, young people who are going to college will not have to pay more than 10 percent of their income in repayment. And that obviously helps to relieve the burden on a lot students -- because, look, IÃ¢ÂÂm a guy who had about $60,000 worth of debt when I graduated from law school, and Michelle had $60,000. And so we were paying a bigger amount every month than our mortgage. And we did that for eight, 10 years. So I know how burdensome this can be.



I do think that the universities still have a role in trying to keep their costs down. And I think that itÃ¢ÂÂs important -- even if we've got better student loan programs, more grants, if the costs keep on going up then we'll never have enough money, you'll never get enough help to avoid taking on these huge debts. And so working with university presidents to try to figure out, where can you cut costs -- of course, it may mean that the food in the cafeteria is a little worse and the gym is not as fancy. But I think all of us have to figure out a way to make sure that higher education is accessible for everybody.



One last point -- I know, Twitter, IÃ¢ÂÂm supposed to be short. (Laughter.) But city -- community colleges is a huge, under-utilized resource, where what we want to do is set up a lifelong learning system where you may have gotten your four-year degree, but five years out you decide you want to go into another field or you want to brush up on new technologies that are going to help you advance. We need to create a system where you can conveniently access community colleges that are working with businesses to train for the jobs that actually exist. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a huge area where I think we can make a lot of progress.



MR. DORSEY: You mention debt a lot. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs come up in conversation a lot recently, especially in some of our recent questions, specifically the debt ceiling. And this is formulated in our next question from RenegadeNerd out of Atlanta: ""Mr. President, will you issue an executive order to raise the debt ceiling pursuant to Section 4 of the 14th Amendment?""



THE PRESIDENT: Can I just say, RenegadeNerd, that picture is -- captures it all there. (Laughter.) He's got his hand over there, heÃ¢ÂÂs looking kind of confused. (Laughter.)



Let me, as quickly as I can, describe whatÃ¢ÂÂs at stake with respect to the debt ceiling. Historically, the United States, whenever it has a deficit, it finances that deficit through the sale of treasuries. And this is a very common practice. Over our lifetimes, typically the government is always running a modest deficit. And Congress is supposed to vote on the amount of debt that Treasury can essentially issue. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a pretty esoteric piece of business; typically has not been something that created a lot of controversy.



WhatÃ¢ÂÂs happening now is, is that Congress is suggesting we may not vote to raise the debt ceiling. If we do not, then the Treasury will run out of money. It will not be able to pay the bills that are owing, and potentially the entire world capital markets could decide, you know what, the full faith and credit of the United States doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean anything. And so our credit could be downgraded, interest rates could go drastically up, and it could cause a whole new spiral into a second recession, or worse.



So this is something that we shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be toying with. What DexterÃ¢ÂÂs question referred to was there are some people who say that under the Constitution, itÃ¢ÂÂs unconstitutional for Congress not to allow Treasury to pay its bills and are suggesting that this should be challenged under the Constitution.



I donÃ¢ÂÂt think we should even get to the constitutional issue. Congress has a responsibility to make sure we pay our bills. WeÃ¢ÂÂve always paid them in the past. The notion that the U.S. is going to default on its debt is just irresponsible. And my expectation is, is that over the next week to two weeks, that Congress, working with the White House, comes up with a deal that solves our deficit, solves our debt problems, and makes sure that our full faith and credit is protected.



MR. DORSEY: So back to jobs. We have a question from New York City about immigrant entrepreneurs: ""Immigrant entrepreneurs can build companies and create jobs for U.S. workers. Will you support a startup visa program?""



THE PRESIDENT: What I want to do is make sure that talented people who come to this country to study, to get degrees, and are willing and interested in starting up businesses can do so, as opposed to going back home and starting those businesses over there to compete against the United States and take away U.S. jobs.



So weÃ¢ÂÂre working with the business community as well as the entrepreneurial community to figure out are there ways that we can streamline the visa system so if you are studying here, youÃ¢ÂÂve got a PhD in computer science or youÃ¢ÂÂve got a PhD in engineering, and you say IÃ¢ÂÂm ready to invest in the United States, create jobs in the United States, then we are able to say to you, we want you to stay here.



And I think that it is possible for us to deal with this problem. But itÃ¢ÂÂs important for us to look at it more broadly. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got an immigration system thatÃ¢ÂÂs broken right now, where too many folks are breaking the law but also our laws make it too hard for talented people to contribute and be part of our society. And weÃ¢ÂÂve always been a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And so we need comprehensive immigration reform, part of which would allow entrepreneurs and high-skilled individuals to stay here -- because we want to be attracting that talent here. We donÃ¢ÂÂt want that -- we donÃ¢ÂÂt want to pay for training them here and then having them benefit other countries.



MR. DORSEY: Our next question was just -- was sent just an hour ago and touches on alternative energy and job creation: ""Will you focus on promoting alternative energy industries in oil states like Louisiana and Texas?""



THE PRESIDENT: I want to promote alternative energy everywhere, including oil states like Louisiana and Texas. This is something that IÃ¢ÂÂm very proud of and doesnÃ¢ÂÂt get a lot of attention. We made the largest investment in clean energy in our history through the Recovery Act. And so we put forward a range of programs that provided credits and grants to startup companies in areas like creating wind turbines, solar panels.



A great example is advanced battery manufacturing. When I came into office, advanced batteries, which are used, for example, in electric cars, we only accounted for 2 percent of the world market in advanced batteries. And we have quintupled our market share, or even gone further, just over the last two years. And weÃ¢ÂÂre projecting that we can get to 30 to 40 percent of that market. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs creating jobs all across the Midwest, all across America.



And whoever wins this race on advanced battery manufacturing is probably going to win the race to produce the cars of the 21st century. China is investing in it. Germany is investing in it. We need to be investing in it as well.



MR. DORSEY: I wanted to take a moment and point out the map just behind you. These are tweets coming in, in real time, and these are questions being asked right now. And it flips between the various categories that weÃ¢ÂÂve determined and also just general askObama questions.



So our next question is coming up on the screen now, from Patrick: Ã¢ÂÂMr. President, in several states we have seen people lose their collective bargaining rights. Do you have a plan to rectify this?""



THE PRESIDENT: The first thing I want to emphasize is that collective bargaining is the reason why the vast majority of Americans enjoy a minimum wage, enjoy weekends, enjoy overtime. So many things that we take for granted are because workers came together to bargain with their employers.



Now, we live in a very competitive society in the 21st century. And that means in the private sector, labor has to take management into account. If labor is making demands that make management broke and they canÃ¢ÂÂt compete, then that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt do anybody any good.



In the public sector, what is true is that some of the pension plans that have been in place and the health benefits that are in place are so out of proportion with whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening in the private sector that a lot of taxpayers start feeling resentful. They say, well, if I donÃ¢ÂÂt have health care where I only have to pay $1 for prescription drugs, why is it that the person whose salary IÃ¢ÂÂm paying has a better deal?



What this means is, is that all of us are going to have to make some adjustments. But the principle of collective bargaining, making sure that people can exercise their rights to be able to join together with other workers and to negotiate and kind of even the bargaining power on either side, thatÃ¢ÂÂs something that has to be protected. And we can make these adjustments in a way that are equitable but preserve peopleÃ¢ÂÂs collective bargaining rights.



So, typically, the challenges against bargaining rights have been taking place at the state level. I don't have direct control over that. But what I can do is to speak out forcefully for the principle that we can make these adjustments that are necessary during these difficult fiscal times, but do it in a way that preserves collective bargaining rights. And certainly at the federal level where I do have influence, I can make sure that we make these adjustments without affecting peopleÃ¢ÂÂs collective bargaining rights.



I'll give you just one example. We froze federal pay for federal workers for two years. Now, that wasnÃ¢ÂÂt real popular, as you might imagine, among federal workers. On the other hand, we were able to do that precisely because we wanted to prevent layoffs and we wanted to make sure that we sent a signal that everybody is going to have to make some sacrifices, including federal workers.



By the way, people who work in the White House, theyÃ¢ÂÂve had their pay frozen since I came in, our high-wage folks. So they havenÃ¢ÂÂt had a raise in two and a half years, and that's appropriate, because a lot of ordinary folks out there havenÃ¢ÂÂt, either. In fact, theyÃ¢ÂÂve seen their pay cut in some cases.



MR. DORSEY: Mr. President, 6 percent of our questions are coming in about housing, which you can see in the graph behind me. And this one in particular has to do with personal debt and housing: Ã¢ÂÂHow will admin work to help underwater homeowners who arenÃ¢ÂÂt behind in payments but are trapped in homes they canÃ¢ÂÂt sell?Ã¢ÂÂ From Robin.



THE PRESIDENT: This is a great question. And remember, I mentioned one of our biggest challenges during the course of the last two and a half years has been dealing with a huge burst of the housing bubble.



What's happened is a lot of folks are underwater, meaning their home values went down so steeply and so rapidly that now their mortgage, the amount they owe, is a lot more than the assessed worth of their home. And that obviously burdens a lot of folks. It means if theyÃ¢ÂÂre selling, theyÃ¢ÂÂve got to sell at a massive loss that they canÃ¢ÂÂt afford. It means that they donÃ¢ÂÂt feel like they have any assets because the single biggest asset of most Americans is their home.



So what weÃ¢ÂÂve been trying to do is to work with the issuers of the mortgages, the banks or the service companies, to convince them to work with homeowners who are paying, trying to do the right thing, trying to stay in their homes, to see if they can modify the loans so that their payments are lower, and in some cases, maybe even modify their principal, so that they donÃ¢ÂÂt feel burdened by these huge debts and feel tempted to walk away from homes that actually they love and where theyÃ¢ÂÂre raising their families.



WeÃ¢ÂÂve made some progress. We have, through the programs that we set up here, have probably seen several million home modifications either directly because we had control of the loan process, or because the private sector followed suit. But itÃ¢ÂÂs not enough. And so weÃ¢ÂÂre going back to the drawing board, talking to banks, try to put some pressure on them to work with people who have mortgages to see if we can make further adjustments, modify loans more quickly, and also see if there may be circumstances where reducing principal is appropriate.



MR. DORSEY: And our next question comes from someone you may know. This is Speaker Boehner.



THE PRESIDENT: Oh, there you go. (Laughter.)



MR. DORSEY: Ã¢ÂÂAfter embarking on a record spending binge that left us deeper in debt, where are the jobs?Ã¢ÂÂ And I want to note that these characters are his fault. (Laughter.)



THE PRESIDENT: First of all --



MR. DORSEY: Not his fault, not his fault.



THE PRESIDENT: -- John obviously needs to work on his typing skills. (Laughter.) Well, look, obviously John is the Speaker of the House, heÃ¢ÂÂs a Republican, and so this is a slightly skewed question. (Laughter.) But what heÃ¢ÂÂs right about is that we have not seen fast enough job growth relative to the need. I mean, we lost, as I said, 4 million jobs before I took office, before I was sworn in. About 4 million jobs were lost in the few months right after I took office before our economic policies had a chance to take any effect.



And over the last 15 months, weÃ¢ÂÂve actually seen two million jobs created in the private sector. And so weÃ¢ÂÂre each month seeing growth in jobs, But when youÃ¢ÂÂve got a 8 million dollar -- 8-million-job hole and youÃ¢ÂÂre only filling it 100,000-200,000 jobs at a time each month, obviously thatÃ¢ÂÂs way too long for a lot of folks who are still out of work.



There are a couple of things that we can continue to do. I actually worked with Speaker Boehner to pass a payroll tax cut in December that put an extra $1,000 in the pockets of almost every single American. That means theyÃ¢ÂÂre spending money. That means that businesses have customers. And that has helped improve overall growth.



We have provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses who have needed a lot of help and have been struggling, including, for example, saying zero capital gains taxes on startups -- because our attitude is we want to encourage new companies, young entrepreneurs, to get out there, start their business, without feeling like if theyÃ¢ÂÂre successful in the first couple of years that somehow they have to pay taxes, as opposed to putting that money back into their business.



So weÃ¢ÂÂve been able to cooperate with Republicans on a range of these issues. There are some areas where the Republicans have been more resistant in cooperating, even though I think most objective observers think itÃ¢ÂÂs the right thing to do. IÃ¢ÂÂll give you a specific example.



ItÃ¢ÂÂs estimated that we have about $2 trillion worth of infrastructure that needs to be rebuilt. Roads, bridges, sewer lines, water mains; our air traffic control system doesnÃ¢ÂÂt make sense. We donÃ¢ÂÂt have the kind of electric grid thatÃ¢ÂÂs smart, meaning it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt waste a lot of energy in transmission. Our broadband system is slower than a lot of other countries.



For us to move forward on a major infrastructure initiative where weÃ¢ÂÂre putting people to work right now -- including construction workers who were disproportionately unemployed when the housing bubble went bust -- to put them to work rebuilding America at a time when interest rates are very low, contractors are looking for work, and the need is there, that is something that could make a huge, positive impact on the economy overall. And itÃ¢ÂÂs an example of making an investment now that ends up having huge payoffs down the road.



We havenÃ¢ÂÂt gotten the kind of cooperation that IÃ¢ÂÂd like to see on some of those ideas and initiatives. But IÃ¢ÂÂm just going to keep on trying and eventually IÃ¢ÂÂm sure the Speaker will see the light. (Laughter.)



MR. DORSEY: Speaking of startups, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a ton of questions about small businesses and how they affect job creation. This one comes from Neal: Ã¢ÂÂSmall biz create jobs. What incentives are you willing to support to improve small business growth?Ã¢ÂÂ



THE PRESIDENT: Well, I just mentioned some of the tax breaks that weÃ¢ÂÂve provided not only to small businesses, but also in some cases were provided big businesses. For example, if theyÃ¢ÂÂre making investments in plants and equipment this year, they can fully write down those costs, take -- essentially depreciate all those costs this year and that saves them a pretty big tax bill. So weÃ¢ÂÂre already initiating a bunch of steps.



The biggest challenge that I hear from small businesses right now actually has to do with financing, because a lot of small businesses got their financing from community banks. Typically, theyÃ¢ÂÂre not getting them from the big Wall Street banks, but theyÃ¢ÂÂre getting them from their various regional banks in their communities. A lot of those banks were pretty over-extended in the commercial real estate market, which has been hammered. A lot of them are still digging themselves out of bad loans that they made that were shown to be bad during the recession.



And so, what weÃ¢ÂÂve tried to do is get the Small Business Administration, the federal agency that helps small businesses, to step in and to provide more financing -- waiving fees, seeing if we can lower interest rates in some cases, making sure that the threshold for companies that qualify for loans are more generous. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs helped a lot of small businesses all across the country. And this is another example of where, working with Congress, my hope is, is that we can continue to provide these tax incentives and maybe do even a little bit more.



Q Our next question was tweeted less than five minutes ago and comes to us from Craig: Ã¢ÂÂMy question is, can you give companies a tax break if they hire an honorable discharged veteran?Ã¢ÂÂ



THE PRESIDENT: This is something that IÃ¢ÂÂve been talking a lot about internally. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got all these young people coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan; have made incredible sacrifices; have taken on incredible responsibilities. You see some 23-year-old who's leading a platoon in hugely dangerous circumstances, making decisions, operating complex technologies. These are folks who can perform. But, unfortunately, what weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing is that a lot of these young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who didnÃ¢ÂÂt serve. And that makes no sense.



So what weÃ¢ÂÂd like to do is potentially combine a tax credit for a company that hires veterans with a campaign to have private companies step up and do the right thing and hire more veterans. And one of the things that weÃ¢ÂÂve done is internally in the federal government we have made a huge emphasis on ramping up our outreach to veterans and the hiring of veterans, and this has been a top priority of mine. The notion that these guys who are sacrificing for our freedom and our security end up coming home and not being able to find a job I think is unacceptable.



MR. DORSEY: Mr. President, this next question comes from someone else you may recognize. And what's interesting about this question, it was heavily retweeted and voted up by our userbase. This comes from NickKristof: Ã¢ÂÂWas it a mistake to fail to get Republicans to commit to raise the debt ceiling at the same time tax cuts were extended?Ã¢ÂÂ



THE PRESIDENT: Nicholas is a great columnist. But I have to tell you the assumption of the question is, is that I was going to be able to get them to commit to raising the debt ceiling.



In December, we were in what was called the lame duck session. The Republicans knew that they were going to be coming in as the majority. We only had a few short weeks to deal with a lot of complicated issues, including repealing ""don't ask, don't tell,"" dealing with a START treaty to reduce nuclear weapons, and come to terms with a budget. And what we were able to do was negotiate a package where we agreed to do something that we didnÃ¢ÂÂt like but that the Republicans badly wanted, which is to extend the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy for another two years.



In exchange, we were able to get this payroll tax that put $1,000 -- tax cut that put $1,000 in the pockets of every American, which would help economic growth and jobs. We were also able to get unemployment insurance extended for the millions of Americans out there who are still out of work and whose benefits were about to run out. And that was a much better deal than I think a lot of people expected.



It would have been great if we were able to also settle this issue of the debt ceiling at that time. That wasnÃ¢ÂÂt the deal that was available. But hereÃ¢ÂÂs the more basic point: Never in our history has the United States defaulted on its debt. The debt ceiling should not be something that is used as a gun against the heads of the American people to extract tax breaks for corporate jet owners, or oil and gas companies that are making billions of dollars because the price of gasoline has gone up so high.



IÃ¢ÂÂm happy to have those debates. I think the American people are on my side on this. What we need to do is to have a balanced approach where everything is on the table. We need to reduce corporate loopholes. We need to reduce discretionary spending on programs that arenÃ¢ÂÂt working. We need to reduce defense spending. Everything has -- we need to look at entitlements, and we have to say, how do we protect and preserve Medicare and Social Security for not just this generation but also future generations. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to require some modifications, even as we maintain its basic structure.



So what IÃ¢ÂÂm hoping to see over the next couple of weeks is people put their dogmas aside, their sacred cows aside; they come together and they say, hereÃ¢ÂÂs a sensible approach that reduces our deficit, makes sure that government is spending within its means, but also continues to make investments in education, in clean energy, and basic research that are going to preserve our competitive advantage going forward.



MR. DORSEY: So speaking of taxes, our next question is coming from us -- from Alabama, from Lane: ""What changes to the tax system do you think are necessary to help solve the deficit problem and for the system to be fair?""



THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that, first of all, itÃ¢ÂÂs important for people to realize that since IÃ¢ÂÂve been in office IÃ¢ÂÂve cut taxes for middle-class families, repeatedly. The Recovery Act cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. The payroll tax cut that we passed in December put an extra thousand dollars in the pockets of every family in America.



And so we actually now have the lowest tax rates since the 1950s. Our tax rates are lower now than they were under Ronald Reagan. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre lower than they were under George Bush -- senior or George Bush, junior. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre lower than they were under Bill Clinton.



The question is how do we pay for the things that we all think are important and how do we make sure that the tax system is equitable? And what IÃ¢ÂÂve said is that in addition to eliminating a whole bunch of corporate loopholes that are just not fair -- the notion that corporate jets should get a bett"	0
43	"Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, says President Obama has not been aggressive enough in taking the fight to ISIS militants who have ravaged Iraq and Syria

Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, says President Obama has not been aggressive enough in taking the fight to ISIS militants who have ravaged Iraq and Syria

The territorial gains of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the Middle East over the past week have prompted a fresh look at what the U.S. can do to stop the militant group. But lawmakers are still divided about whether a military or political strategy provides the best shot at success.

""We need to have a more robust strategy. We need more troops on the ground, we need forward air controllers - we're just referring to air strikes,"" said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""We found in Vietnam War that if you don't have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect, but we need to have forward air controllers, we need to have special forces, we need to have more of those kind of raids that were so successful into Syria. We need to have a strategy. There is no strategy. And anyone that says that there is, I'd like to hear what it is because it certainly isn't apparent now and right now.""

He said that there should be a few thousand more American troops on the ground to carry out that kind of mission.

But California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says the U.S. will not be able to sustain any victories in Iraq unless the government is able to resolve its political differences.

During the Iraq War, Schiff said, ""We won Ramadi but it didn't stay won because the political problems that preceded the first Iraq war haven't been solved and that is the Sunnis have not been brought into the government adequately, Sunni forces haven't been adequately trained and integrated into the military.

""Until those changes are made, until Iraq makes the political decision to fully incorporate the Sunnis we can add more forces we can win these battles but they're not going to stay won. I think that's the real lesson of the last Iraq War and what's going on now,"" he said.

He warned that sending in a lot of American troops could ""aggravate"" the threat that ISIS already poses and risk further escalation of the fight.

McCain, for his part, argues that President Obama never should have pulled troops out of the country entirely in 2011 because the 2007 troop surge had succeeded.

""George W. Bush at least had the guts to reverse and sponsor the surge which...eventually then succeeded. I wish, I pray that Barack Obama would do the same thing,"" he said.

For now, Schiff said there is an ""ebb and flow and a largely stalemated situation in the war against ISIS."" He said he is concerned that the administration appears to be measuring success by the number of bombing runs it is able to carry out in the region.

""I think the more important metrics are how are doing in stopping foreign fighters from entering the country, how are we doing in drying up ISIS' resources, how are we doing in working with our gulf allies in fighting the ideological fight within Islam that we're not positioned to fight ourselves, and how are we doing in terms of our military support,"" he said."	0
44	"Last week, President Obama offered a spirited defense of his partyÃ¢ÂÂs values Ã¢ÂÂ in effect, of the legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society. Immediately thereafter, as always happens when Democrats take a stand, the civility police came out in force. The president, we were told, was being too partisan; he needs to treat his opponents with respect; he should have lunch with them, and work out a consensus.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a bad idea. Equally important, itÃ¢ÂÂs an undemocratic idea.

LetÃ¢ÂÂs review the story so far.

Two weeks ago, House Republicans released their big budget proposal, selling it to credulous pundits as a statement of necessity, not ideology Ã¢ÂÂ a document telling America What Must Be Done.

But it was, in fact, a deeply partisan document, which you might have guessed from the opening sentence: Ã¢ÂÂWhere the president has failed, House Republicans will lead.Ã¢ÂÂ It hyped the danger of deficits, yet even on its own (not at all credible) accounting, spending cuts were used mainly to pay for tax cuts rather than deficit reduction. The transparent and obvious goal was to use deficit fears to impose a vision of small government and low taxes, especially on the wealthy.

So the House budget proposal revealed a yawning gap between the two partiesÃ¢ÂÂ priorities. And it revealed a deep difference in views about how the world works."	0

The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to Ã¢ÂÂsend Hillary to prisonÃ¢ÂÂ, according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman, who warns that unless the former First LadyÃ¢ÂÂs crimes are seen to be punished, Ã¢ÂÂeveryday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂHillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America,Ã¢ÂÂ Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National GeographicÃ¢ÂÂs new docu-series The Story of Us.

Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise, Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying, Ã¢ÂÂGoddamnit man, you were elected for this very reason, lock that bitch up!Ã¢ÂÂ

After being accused of political incorrectness, Freeman laughed again, saying Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs all about being loving and caring these days, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it?Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThe most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else.Ã¢ÂÂ

The veteran actor, who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career, cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else.

In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

While insisting that the KremlinÃ¢ÂÂs election interference is Ã¢ÂÂno movie script,Ã¢ÂÂ and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not, Morgan said, Ã¢ÂÂwe need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂWe need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say, Ã¢ÂÂMy fellow Americans. During this past election, we cam under attack by the Russian government,Ã¢ÂÂ Freeman demands Trump to say, adding, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ"	1

Transcript: ""This Week"" with Former Vice President Dick Cheney and George Will, Peter Beinart, Paul Gigot and Jane Mayer.

KARL: Good morning, and welcome to ""This Week.""

CHENEY: There is no middle ground.

KARL: This morning, a ""This Week"" exclusive, former Vice President Dick Cheney, the administration's harshest critic...

CHENEY: The president's been largely silent. Half-measures keep you half-exposed. The White House must stop dithering.

KARL: ... with no apologies of his own.

CHENEY: I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program.

KARL: National security, Iran, politics, and...

BIDEN: Iraq, I mean, it's going to be one of the great achievements of this administration.

KARL: ... Dick Cheney takes on the current vice president, only on ""This Week."" Then, a Washington thaw.

OBAMA: I'm going to spend some time listening.

KARL: But can bipartisanship survive the politics of the moment?

PALIN: We need a commander-in-chief, not a professor of law standing at the lectern.

KARL: That and the rest of the week's politics on our roundtable with George Will, Peter Beinart of the Council on Foreign Relations, the New Yorker's Jane Mayer, and Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal.

And as always, the Sunday funnies.

LETTERMAN: John McCain knew that it was Sarah Palin's birthday, and he did something very nice for her. He bought her a Toyota.

ANNOUNCER: From the heart of the nation's capital, ""This Week"" with ABC's congressional correspondent, Jonathan Karl, live from the Newseum on Pennsylvania Avenue.

KARL: Joining me now, former Vice President Dick Cheney.

Mr. Vice President, welcome to ""This Week.""

CHENEY: Good morning, John.

KARL: Now, you have been unflinching in your criticism of this administration's handling of terrorism, counterterrorism. Most recently, talking about the Christmas Day bomber, you said, ""It is clear once again that President Obama is trying to pretend that we are not at war."" Now, this morning, we have heard from the current vice president, Joe Biden, directly in response to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: We're pursuing that war with a vigor like it's never been seen before. We've eliminated 12 of their top 20 people. We have taken out 100 of their associates. We are making -- we've sent them underground. They are, in fact, not able to do anything remotely like they were in the past. They are on the run. I don't know where Dick Cheney has been.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: Your response?

CHENEY: Well, my reference to the notion that the president was trying to avoid treating this as a war was in relation to his initial response when we heard about the Christmas underwear bomber...

KARL: Right.

CHENEY: ... up in Detroit, when he went out and said this was the act of an isolated extremist. No, it wasn't. And we found out over time, obviously -- and he eventually changed his -- his assessment -- but that, in fact, this was an individual who'd been trained by Al Qaida, who'd been part of a larger conspiracy, and it was closer to being an act of war than it was the act of an isolated extremist.

It's the mindset that concerns me, John. I think it's -- it's very important to go back and keep in mind the distinction between handling these events as criminal acts, which was the way we did before 9/11, and then looking at 9/11 and saying, ""This is not a criminal act,"" not when you destroy 16 acres of Manhattan, kill 3,000 Americans, blow a big hole in the Pentagon. That's an act of war.

KARL: Well -- well...

CHENEY: And what the administration was slow to do was to come to that -- that recognition that we are at war, not dealing with criminal acts. And as I say, my response there dealt specifically to the fact the president called it an isolated extremist. It was not.

KARL: Well, I want to get to that notion of treating this as a law enforcement action, but what the administration will say is, look at what they have done, 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, doubling, tripling, and maybe even more the drone attacks on the tribal areas in Pakistan on Al Qaida targets. They say that they are actually dedicating more resources to the fight against Al Qaida than you were.

CHENEY: Well, I -- you know, I'm a complete supporter of what they're doing in Afghanistan. I think the president made the right decision to send troops into Afghanistan. I thought it took him a while to get there.

Having Stan McChrystal now in charge in Afghanistan I think is an excellent choice. General McChrystal's one of the most able officers I know. I'm glad they're doing what they're doing in Afghanistan. I'm not a critic of what they're doing, in terms of how they're dealing with that situation.

But I do see repeatedly examples that there are key members in the administration, like Eric Holder, for example, the attorney general, who still insists on thinking of terror attacks against the United States as criminal acts as opposed to acts of war, and that's a -- that's a huge distinction.

KARL: OK, before we get to Eric Holder, a couple more things from the vice president. He's been out responding preemptively to you. One thing he said we heard in the open, that he believes Iraq may ultimately prove to be one of the greatest achievements of the Obama administration.

CHENEY: Well, I -- I guess I shouldn't be surprised by my friend, Joe Biden. I'm glad he now believes Iraq is a success. Of course, Obiden and -- Obama and Biden campaigned from one end of the country to the other for two years criticizing our Iraq policy.

CHENEY: They opposed the surge that was absolutely crucial to our getting to the point we're at now with respect to Iraq. And for them to try to take credit for what's happened in Iraq strikes me as a little strange. I think if -- if they had had their way, if we'd followed the policies they'd pursued from the outset or advocated from the outset, Saddam Hussein would still be in power in Baghdad today.

So if they're going to take credit for it, fair enough, for what they've done while they're there, but it ought to go with a healthy dose of ""Thank you, George Bush"" up front and a recognition that some of their early recommendations, with respect to prosecuting that war, we're just dead wrong.

KARL: Well, in fact, Vice President Biden says that he believes that the war in Iraq was not worth it. What do you say to that? I mean, given the resources that were drawn away from the -- what you could argue is the central front in Afghanistan, Pakistan, is he right about that?

CHENEY: No. I -- I believe very deeply in the proposition that what we did in Iraq was the right thing to do. It was hard to do. It took a long time. There were significant costs involved.

But we got rid of one of the worst dictators of the 20th century. We took down his government, a man who'd produced and used weapons of mass destruction, a man who'd started two different wars, a man who had a relationship with terror. We're going to have a democracy in Iraq today. We do today. They're going to have another free election this March.

This has been an enormous achievement from the standpoint of peace and stability in the Middle East and ending a threat to the United States. Now, as I say, Joe Biden doesn't believe that. Joe Biden wants to take credit -- I'm not sure for what -- since he opposed that policy pretty much from the outset.

KARL: I think what he wants to take credit for is taking resources out of Iraq, the fact...

CHENEY: That's being done in accordance with a timetable that we initiated, that we -- that we negotiated with -- with the Iraqis. I mean, that was our policy.

KARL: Another thing from the vice president, he also addressed the possibility of another 9/11-style attack.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: The idea of there being a massive attack in the United States like 9/11 is unlikely, in my view. But if you see what's happening, particularly with Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, they have decided to move in a direction of much more small-bore, but devastatingly frightening attacks.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: Is he right?

CHENEY: I don't think so. And I would point to a study that was released just within the last week or two up at the Kennedy School at Harvard by a gentleman -- Mowatt-Larssen's his name, I believe. He was CIA for 23 years, director of intelligence at the Energy Department for a long time, that looks at this whole question of weapons of mass destruction and Al Qaida and comes to the conclusion that there's a very high threat that Al Qaida is trying very hard to acquire a weapon of mass destruction and, if they're successful in acquiring it, that they will use it.

I think he's right. I think, in fact, the situation with respect to Al Qaida to say that, you know, that was a big attack we had on 9/11, but it's not likely again, I just think that's dead wrong. I think the biggest strategic threat the United States faces today is the possibility of another 9/11 with a nuclear weapon or a biological agent of some kind, and I think Al Qaida is out there even as we meet trying to figure out how to do that.

KARL: And do you think that the Obama administration is taking enough serious steps to prevent that?

CHENEY: I think they need to do everything they can to prevent it. And if the mindset is it's not likely, then it's difficult to mobilize the resources and get people to give it the kind of priority that it deserves.

KARL: OK, let's get to -- you mentioned Eric Holder, the treatment of the Christmas Day underwear bomber. How do you think that case should have been dealt with?

CHENEY: I think the -- the proper way to -- to deal with it would have been to treat him as an enemy combatant. I think that was the right way to go.

The thing I learned from watching that process unfold, though, was that the administration really wasn't equipped to deal with the aftermath of an attempted attack against the United States in the sense that they didn't know what to do with the guy.

There was talk earlier after they'd dismantled the system we'd put in place for prisoner interrogation of high-value detainees. They'd gone out supposedly to create the HIG, high-value interrogation program, but in reality, it was not up and running at Christmastime when it should have been. It started months before that, to put that in place. They need a process, a set of institutions that they can fall back on. Admittedly, this is hard. We had a hard time dealing with this. You've got the Supreme Court on one side that -- that is going to evaluate everything you do, and you've got to be careful with that. The Congress gets involved in it.

CHENEY: So I'm not saying it's an easy task, but by this point, when they've made all the decisions they've had, closed Guantanamo, end (ph) the high-value detainee program and so forth, I think those are all mistakes. Those were the tools we put in place to deal with this kind of situation. They should have had something to put in lieu of those programs, and it would look like they do not have -- have that kind of capability yet.

KARL: If you have somebody in custody like Abdulmutallab, after just trying to blow up an airliner, and you think he has information on another attack, I mean, do you think that those enhanced interrogation techniques should have been -- should have been used? I mean, would you -- do you think that he should have been, for instance, subject to everything, including waterboarding?

CHENEY: Well, I think the -- the professionals need to make that judgment. We've got people in -- we had in our administration -- I'm sure they're still there -- many of them were career personnel -- who are expects in this subject. And they are the ones that you ought to turn somebody like Abdulmutallab over to, let them be the judge of whether or not he's prepared to cooperate and how they can best achieve his cooperation.

KARL: But you believe they should have had the option of everything up to and including waterboarding?

CHENEY: I think you ought to have all of those capabilities on the table. Now, President Obama has taken them off the table. He announced when he came in last year that they would never use anything other than the U.S. Army manual, which doesn't include those techniques. I think that's a mistake.

KARL: OK. So -- so was it a mistake when your administration took on the Richard Reid case? This is very similar. This was somebody that was trying to blow up an airliner with a shoe bomb, and he was within five minutes of getting taken off that plane read his Miranda rights, four times, in fact, in 48 hours, and tried through the civilian system. Was that a mistake?

CHENEY: Well, first of all, I believe he was not tried. He pled guilty. They never did end up having a trial.

Secondly, when this came up, as I recall, it was December of '01, just a couple of months after 9/11. We were not yet operational with the military commissions. We hadn't had all the Supreme Court decisions handed down about what we could and couldn't do with the commissions.

KARL: But you still had an option to put him into military custody.

CHENEY: Well, we could have put him into military custody. I don't -- I don't question that. The point is, in this particular case, all of that was never worked out, primarily because he pled guilty.

KARL: Now, I'd like to read you something that the sentencing judge reading the -- giving him his life sentence read to Richard Reid at the time of that sentencing. Here it is. He said to Reid, ""You are not an enemy combatant. You are a terrorist. You are not a soldier in any war. To give you that reference, to call you a soldier gives you far too much stature. We do not negotiate with terrorists. We hunt them down one by one and bring them to justice.""

The judge in that case was a Reagan appointee. Doesn't he make a good point?

CHENEY: Well, I don't think so, in a sense that it -- if it -- if you interpret that as taking you to the point where all of these people are going to be treated as though they're guilty of individual criminal acts.

I want to come back again to the basic point I tried to make at the outset, John. And up until 9/11, all terrorist attacks were criminal acts. After 9/11, we made the decision that these were acts of war, these were strategic threats to the United States.

Once you make that judgment, then you can use a much broader range of tools, in terms of going after your adversary. You go after those who provide them safe harbor and sanctuary. You go after those who finance and those who provide weapons for them and those who train them. And you treat them as unlawful enemy combatants.

There's a huge distinction here in terms of the kinds of policies you put in place going forward. And what I'm most concerned about isn't so much argument about all the stuff in the past, about what happened to Abdulmutallab or Richard Reid. I think the relevant point is: What are the policies going to be going forward?

And if you're really serious and you believe this is a war and if you believe the greatest threat is a 9/11 with nukes or a 9/11 with a biological agent of some kind, then you have to consider it as a war, you have to consider it as something we may have to deal with tomorrow. You don't want the vice president of the United States running around saying, ""Oh, it's not likely to happen.""

KARL: Now, on that question of trying, you know, dealing as enemy combatants or through the criminal justice system, I came across this. This is a document that was put out by the Bush Justice Department under Attorney General Ashcroft...

CHENEY: Right.

KARL: ... covering the years 2001 to 2005. And if you go right to page one, they actually tout the criminal prosecutions...

CHENEY: They did.

KARL: ... of terror suspects, saying, ""Altogether, the department has brought charges against 375 individuals in terrorism- related investigations and has convicted 195 to date."" That was 2005. Again, seems to make the administration's point that they're not doing it all that differently from how you were doing it.

CHENEY: Well, we didn't all agree with that. We had -- I can remember a meeting in the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing of the White House where we had a major shootout over how this was going to be handled between the Justice Department, that advocated that approach, and many of the rest of us, who wanted to treat it as an intelligence matter, as an act of war with military commissions.

We never clearly or totally resolved those issues. These are tough questions, no doubt about it. You want my opinion, my view of what ought to happen, I think we have to treat it as a -- as a war. This is a strategic threat to the United States. I think that's why we were successful for seven-and-a-half years in avoiding a further major attack against the United States.

And I do get very nervous and very upset when that's the dominant approach, as it was sometimes in the Bush administration or certainly would appear to be at times in the new Obama administration.

KARL: Did you more often win or lose those battles, especially as you got to the second term?

CHENEY: Well, I suppose it depends on which battle you're talking about. I won some; I lost some. I can't...

(CROSSTALK)

KARL: ... waterboarding, clearly, what was your...

CHENEY: I was a big supporter of waterboarding. I was a big supporter of the enhanced interrogation techniques that...

KARL: And you opposed the administration's actions of doing away with waterboarding?

CHENEY: Yes.

KARL: I'd like to ask you about the big terror case now, which is the KSM trial. The administration very much wants to see the mastermind of 9/11 tried in civilian courts here in the United States. New York has obviously objected.

Do you think that's going to happen? Do you think this will be a civilian trial? Or are they not going to be able to do it?

CHENEY: It looks to me like they're going to have great difficulty doing it in New York. I mean, even the mayor's come out against it now. I think trying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York's a big -- big mistake. It gives him a huge platform to promulgate his -- his particular brand of propaganda around the world.

I think he ought to be at Guantanamo. I think he ought to be tried at Guantanamo in front of a military commission. They've got difficulties now, because my guess is they don't want to send him back to Guantanamo, because that would validate, if you will, the value of Guantanamo. They're trying to close it, clearly haven't been able to get it done.

But my guess is, in the end, he'll end up being tried in front of a military commission on a military facility some place.

KARL: So you think Guantanamo will be open when this president leaves office?

CHENEY: I wouldn't be surprised. It's a valuable facility. There's a reason why we set it up. It makes good sense. There's obviously great reluctance on Capitol Hill to appropriate the funds to close it down. I think -- I think Guantanamo is going to be there for quite a while.

KARL: And one other point -- I just want to read also from a previous interview that you gave -- one of your points about Guantanamo is, if you release the hard-core Al Qaida terrorists, you said, that are held at Guantanamo, I think they go back into the business of trying to kill more Americans and mount further mass casualty attacks. If you turn them loose and they go kill more Americans, who's responsible for that?

And it's a real concern. We've heard from the president's homeland security adviser, John Brennan, saying that at minimum 10 percent of the more than 500 that have been released from Guantanamo have gone back into the fight.

But Brennan also wrote this. He said, ""I want to underscore the fact that all of these cases relate to detainees released during the previous administration and under the prior detainee review process.""

In other words, all of those released from Guantanamo that have gone back into the fight were released by your administration. Can't you make the case that the Obama administration has actually been more responsible about releasing who they release from Guantanamo?

CHENEY: I wouldn't make that -- I wouldn't make that case, John. I think -- as I recall, the percentage that we had of the recidivists was 12 percent. And we released prisoners back basically to their home countries, partly because the State Department was under enormous pressure to do so, and there was an effort to try to return them. The Saudis had a rehabilitation program for returned Saudis, and...

KARL: Did you oppose those releases?

CHENEY: I did. I didn't think that releasing anybody was the right thing to do, unless you had evidence that, you know, there was a mistake of some kind or they'd been -- been before a commission and you'd reviewed their case and found that the case didn't stand up, and that was usually the case. They were put through a thorough scrub before they were released.

Obviously, some of them got through the filter. But I think, out of the ones that remain, those are the real hard core, and I think your recidivist rate would be far higher than it was on those that have already been released.

It's a tough problem; I'll be the first to admit it. But I think you have to have a facility like Guantanamo to hold these individuals who are members of Al Qaida, who've tried to kill Americans, and who -- when they're released, they'll go back out and try to kill Americans again.

KARL: I'd like to move to Iran. Do you trust the Obama administration to do what is necessary to keep Iran from getting nuclear weapons?

CHENEY: I remain to be persuaded.

KARL: Do you think that sanctions can work? I mean, that's the track they've chosen.

CHENEY: Well, I think -- I hope sanctions work.

KARL: It's the same track you chose (ph).

CHENEY: We -- I certainly would hope sanctions would work, but I think they're most likely to work if you keep the military option on the table. I don't think you want to eliminate the military -- the possibility of military action. I think that's essential to give any kind of meaning at all to negotiations over sanctions.

KARL: How close did you come -- how close did the Bush administration come to taking military action against Iran?

CHENEY: Well, I would -- some of that I can't talk about, obviously, still. I'm sure it's still classified. We clearly never made the decision -- we never crossed over that line of saying, ""Now we're going to mount a military operation to deal with the problem.""

The president was always hopeful -- and I think everybody else was, too -- that we could find a way to deal with it within having to resort to military force. One of the problems that the Obama administration inherited was the Iranian problem, and it's a tough one.

KARL: David Sanger of the New York Times says that the Israelis came to you -- came to the administration in the final months and asked for certain things, bunker-buster bombs, air-to-air refueling capability, overflight rights, and that basically the administration dithered, did not give the Israelis a response. Was that a mistake?

CHENEY: I -- I can't get into it still. I'm sure a lot of those discussions are still very sensitive.

KARL: Let me ask you: Did you advocate a harder line, including in the military area, in those -- in those final months?

CHENEY: Usually.

KARL: And with respect to Iran?

CHENEY: Well, I -- I made public statements to the effect that I felt very strongly that we had to have the military option, that it had to be on the table, that it had to be a meaningful option, and that we might well have to resort to military force in order to deal with the threat that Iran represented. The problem here being that a nuclear-armed Iran is a huge threat to that entire part of the world and, indeed, to the United States.

KARL: Was it -- was it a...

CHENEY: We never got to the point where the president had to make a decision one way or the other.

KARL: Was that a mistake? Was it a mistake to leave that nuclear capability intact?

CHENEY: Well, we -- we did a lot, because we were very concerned about nuclear capability in the hands of rogue states or potentially shared with terrorist organizations, and we were successful in taking down, for example, Saddam Hussein, who had messed with nuclear weapons twice previously, taking down the A.Q. Khan network, a black-market operation that was providing technology to the North Koreans, Iranians, and Libyans. We successfully obtained all the Libyan materials for their nuclear program, so we got a lot done.

We didn't get everything done. We still -- when we finished, there still was the ongoing Iranian problem and the ongoing North Korean problem. Both of them remain to be addressed.

KARL: I'd like to get your response to Sarah Palin's recent comments on Iran.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PALIN: Say he decided to declare war on Iran or decided really to come out and do whatever he could to support Israel, which I would like him to do, if he decided to toughen up and do all that he can to secure our nation and our allies, I think people would perhaps shift their thinking a little bit and decide, well, maybe he's tougher than we think he -- than he is today.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: She's, of course, talking about President Obama, seemed to be implying that this would be a good political move for him. What's your take?

CHENEY: I don't think a president can make a judgment like that on the basis of politics. The stakes are too high, the consequences too significant to be treating those as simple political calculations. When you begin to talk about war, talk about crossing international borders, you talk about committing American men and women to combat, that takes place on a plane clear above any political consideration.

KARL: So...

CHENEY: So I'd be -- I'd be very cautious about treating that kind of issue on those kinds of conditions.

KARL: We're almost out of time. We're going to get you very quickly on a few other subjects. First of all, one more on Palin. Is she qualified to be president?

CHENEY: I haven't made a decision yet on who I'm going to support for president the next time around. Whoever it is, is going to have to prove themselves capable of being president of the United States. And those tests will -- will come during the course of campaigns, obviously. I think -- well, I think all the prospective candidates out there have got a lot of work to do if, in fact, they're going to persuade a majority of Americans that they're ready to take on the world's toughest job.

KARL: OK, ""don't ask/don't tell"" -- you're a former defense secretary -- should this policy be repealed?

CHENEY: Twenty years ago, the military were strong advocates of ""don't ask/don't tell,"" when I was secretary of defense. I think things have changed significantly since then. I see that Don Mullen -- or Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has indicated his belief that we ought to support a change in the policy. So I think -- my guess is the policy will be changed.

KARL: And do you think that's a good thing? I mean, is it time to allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military?

CHENEY: I think the society has moved on. I think it's partly a generational question. I say, I'm reluctant to second-guess the military in this regard, because they're the ones that have got to make the judgment about how these policies affect the military capability of our -- of our units, and that first requirement that you have to look at all the time is whether or not they're still capable of achieving their mission, and does the policy change, i.e., putting gays in the force, affect their ability to perform their mission?

When the chiefs come forward and say, ""We think we can do it,"" then it strikes me that it's -- it's time to reconsider the policy. And I think Admiral Mullen said that.

KARL: And, finally, I know that you have a reunion coming up later this month with President Bush. This'll be the first time you've seen him since leaving office, face to face?

CHENEY: Pretty much, yes. We talk on the telephone periodically, but the first time I've seen him since January 20th.

KARL: What does he think of you being so outspoken in contrast to him?

CHENEY: Well, I don't think he's opposed to it, by any means. I'd be inclined to let him speak for himself about it. The reason I've been outspoken is because there were some things being said, especially after we left office, about prosecuting CIA personnel that had carried out our counterterrorism policy or disbarring lawyers in the Justice Department who had -- had helped us put those policies together, and I was deeply offended by that, and I thought it was important that some senior person in the administration stand up and defend those people who'd done what we asked them to do.

And that's why I got started on it. I'm the vice president now -- ex-vice president. I have the great freedom and luxury of speaking out, saying what I -- what I want to say, what I believe. And I have not been discouraged from doing so.

KARL: And that includes writing a book?

CHENEY: Writing a book, that's correct.

KARL: Can you give us -- before you go -- a quick nugget that's going to be in the book, give us the title, give us something going?

Writers May Have Pact. Huckabee Crosses Picket LineÃ¢ÂÂAgain

by Mike Hall, Feb 8, 2008

Television and movie writers who have been on strike since Nov. 5 will meet tomorrow in New York City and Los Angeles to discuss a potential tentative agreement that could end the strike. The Writers Guild of America members have been fighting to win a fair share of revenue for their work distributed online, through DVDs and other new media.

Also on the strike front, Republican presidential candidate and former Gov. Mike Huckabee (Ark.) crossed another picket line (See below.).

Officials of the Writers Guild of America, East ( WGAE), Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) have been meeting informally since Jan. 24, the first meetings between the two sides since the producers walked out of negotiations in December.

In a letter to their members posted on both unionsÃ¢ÂÂ websites today, WGAE President Michael Winship and WGAW President Patric Verrone say:

We are continuing to negotiate the terms of a tentative agreement with the AMPTP. We anticipate that we will be able to present the terms of that agreement to you in the next few days. In order to have a full discussion with you of the terms and how they were reached, and in order to get your input before making recommendations or decisions, we have scheduled membership meetings for current-active members only for this Sat., February 9, in New York and Los Angeles.

We urge you to attend. We have gotten to this point in our negotiation as the direct result of the power of this strike, which each of you has generated. Neither the Negotiating Committee, nor the East Council or the West Board, will take action on any contract until after the membership meetings are held and your voices have been heard. We are all in this together.

This afternoon, several hundred writers rallied and marched at the Time Warner Center in New York City. Both sides have agreed to a news blackout so details of the possible tentative agreement are not available.

Meanwhile, Writers Guild members met Huckabee with angry resistance last night as he crossed a picket line to be a guest on Ã¢ÂÂThe Colbert Report.Ã¢ÂÂ This is how the WGAE website describes the episode:

As his black SUV arrived outside the set, 20 or so picketers swarmed in close, shouting things such as Ã¢ÂÂDonÃ¢ÂÂt cross Governor!Ã¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂThis is a struck show!Ã¢ÂÂ

As Mr. HuckabeeÃ¢ÂÂs security team led him toward the guest entrance WGA members persisted in their attempt to persuade him not to cross, shouting and holding up signs that read Ã¢ÂÂHuckabee DonÃ¢ÂÂt Cross (Again)Ã¢ÂÂ & Ã¢ÂÂHuckabee Supports Scabs.Ã¢ÂÂ This strong union action was captured on film by reporters from CNN and NBC, who were there on the scene to record his appearance. Mr. Huckabee gained notoriety by being the first guest for Jay Leno the night the TV host returned to work without his writers on January 3rd.

On Jan. 30, Republican front-runner Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) crossed a writersÃ¢ÂÂ picket line to appear on the Leno show.

48	"Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead.

Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasnÃ¢ÂÂt utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,Ã¢ÂÂ said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. Ã¢ÂÂBut Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal heÃ¢ÂÂs eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs orders from drive-through windows and scoop the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs ice cream from the carton.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mr. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs eating habits to the press.

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs borderline creepy,Ã¢ÂÂ the staffer said. Ã¢ÂÂThe first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like heÃ¢ÂÂs dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. ItÃ¢ÂÂs gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mr. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs McDonalds habits are even weirder.

Ã¢ÂÂHe orders the same thing every time,Ã¢ÂÂ said the staffer. Ã¢ÂÂHe orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&MÃ¢ÂÂs. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.Ã¢ÂÂ

No wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit. The Halfway Post wishes her good luck on her future endeavors.

49	"WE WILL RIOT! Michelle ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs Mom Will Receive $160k Every Year Out Of TaxpayersÃ¢ÂÂ Pockets!

This amount of corruption is a next level thing that we havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen portrayed this nonchalantly before. Namely, Michelle ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs mom failed to earn a pension thatÃ¢ÂÂs three times the amount of an average American familyÃ¢ÂÂs whole income!

It appears to be that just as Barack, the rest of the ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs never intended on getting jobs as us, the regular folks, because they got the chance to live on the backs of honest and hard working Americans that pay taxes.

Congress just announced the most stupid, unexplained and unethical waste of taxpayer money prepared by no other than Obama.

First Grandma Marian Robinson, 79, will get a big fat check for a lifetime worth 160K government pension when she takes off the White House next year, as concluded by congressional budget statements.

As concluded in documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mrs. Robinson got to be eligible for the lifetime pension for Ã¢ÂÂservices rendered as full-time/in-home caregiverÃ¢ÂÂ for granddaughters Malia, 18, and Sasha, 15, during President ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs eight years in office.

Michelle ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs mom got to live better than a royalty in the White House, but they are still going to privilege her with $160,000 every year for the rest of her life just for being there her own granddaughters?

How pathetic excuse is that?

51	"A dangerous sentiment on the left threatens to derail what could be the biggest progressive achievement in half a century. It's the view that any health-care reform that doesn't include a public option isn't ""real"" reform and thus isn't worth doing. This mantra has become an article of faith among many Democrats who haven't necessarily thought through the matter but who take their cues from leaders advancing this argument. Unless liberals rethink this premise, and fast, Democrats will squander their best chance in a generation to end the scandal of the uninsured, bring health security to every American family and begin the long-term process of getting national health costs under control.

The first fallacy of the ""public option or nothing"" mantra is the notion that we'll never cover everyone without a Medicare-style program for Americans under 65. The experiences of Switzerland and the Netherlands prove that this isn't the case. Both have pioneered market-based universal health care. Both cover all their citizens using private insurers, and they do so for much less cost -- 10 percent of gross domestic product for the Dutch and 12 percent for Switzerland, compared with 17 percent in the United States, where nearly 50 million people are still uninsured.

Those countries also boast better health outcomes than we do, even when compared to states with similar demographics, such as Connecticut and Massachusetts. Sick people in both countries are pursued as customers by private insurers (rather than shunned, as they are in the United States) because health plans are paid more for sick enrollees via a government-designed system of ""risk adjustment."" The Swiss and Dutch achievements are important because conservative critics often act as though fully socialized systems, such as those in Britain and Canada, are the inevitable result of any drive for universal coverage. In fact, as these two countries show, it is possible to cover everyone without a ""big government takeover.""

A related fallacy is that the public option is the most important issue to debate. It's not. The central progressive breakthrough in any reform should be to make it possible for every American to access group health coverage outside the employment setting -- access that does not currently exist but which the proposed insurance exchanges would enable. What's critical, therefore, is the structure of these exchanges and the rules about who would be eligible to use them. Such questions have received disturbingly little attention but need to be front and center. For example, some legislation proposes barring people who enjoy employer-based coverage from seeking insurance from the new exchanges; this ban should be scrapped in favor of the proposal offered by Sen. Ron Wyden, under which employees could use the cash their companies spend on their benefits to buy coverage they prefer at the exchange.

I respect those in my party who seek the single-payer system into which the public option might eventually evolve. But I don't agree that it's the best answer for the United States. Though single payer has merits, especially in administrative efficiency, it is also likely to freeze in place our fragmented, uncoordinated system of fee-for-service care. It would encourage providers to goose volume (to boost their incomes) rather than improve quality and would offer greater rewards for providers of acute care when we need a fresh focus on chronic disease management. Single payer also asks government to do things I don't think it is competent to do, such as setting prices across a large swath of the health sector in ways that seem certain to create damaging rigidities or resource misallocations (as happens in Medicare).

Finally, if government is the sole payer, provider payments will become even more politicized than they are today. On the eve of beneficial innovations in drug therapies, devices and cost-effective ways to deliver better care, it is ill-advised to make the government's hand too rigid. Private health plans have many flaws, to be sure, but if sensibly regulated they're likely to respond more nimbly to disperse medical innovations.

Liberals should make peace with the notion that a regulated market of competing private health plans can be the vehicle for getting everyone covered. Yes, it means that unlike some other advanced countries, we'll have billions of ""health"" dollars siphoned off by middlemen and marketers. But if liberals think of it as a jobs program, they'll learn to love it. If everyone's covered and insurer ""cherry-picking"" is dead, health insurance will come to look more like a regulated utility.

Those on the left still seeking incentive should consider: In 2006, Sen. Ted Kennedy urged Massachusetts Democrats to support Mitt Romney's plan for universal coverage via a competing system of regulated private insurers, paired with an individual mandate and subsidies for low earners. Kennedy knew this would become a model for a bipartisan fix for the country. Now, a Kennedy-approved model is within reach. Liberals, far from resisting it as a setback, should celebrate it as a triumph.

Matt Miller, a former Clinton White House aide, is a management consultant and the author of ""The Tyranny of Dead Ideas."" In recent years he has advised and given paid speeches to doctor groups, hospitals, pharmaceutical firms and insurance companies, as well as to low-income advocacy groups promoting universal coverage."	0

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ANNOUNCER: From the heart of the nation's capital, ""This Week"" with ABC's senior White House correspondent, Jake Tapper, live from the Newseum on Pennsylvania Avenue.

TAPPER: And joining me now is House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Minority Leader John Boehner. Gentlemen, thanks so much for joining me.

HOYER: Thank you.

BOEHNER: Hey, good morning.

TAPPER: So you got a letter last night -- I actually think I got it before you guys did...

HOYER: I think you did.

TAPPER: ... but from President Obama requesting $50 billion in emergency spending for state and local governments. Leader Hoyer, you have said that there is spending fatigue on Capitol Hill. Can you get this passed?

HOYER: Well, I think it's accurate that there's spending fatigue, not only on Capitol Hill, but around the country. People are concerned about the debt level, and we are, as well. But clearly, you cannot not continue to stimulate an economy that is still struggling to get out of the deep ditch that we found it in about 18 months ago.

What the president is saying is, we need to expend additional dollars to make sure that we don't have significant layoffs in the next few months, which will again depress the economy, so that -- I understand what he's saying. I have asked the White House to look at the package that we -- the Recovery and Reinvestment Act that we passed, approximately $800-plus billion. There are clearly funds in there that have not been expended to see whether or not there are some available for this more immediate priority than some that may not be quite as immediate.

TAPPER: Leader Boehner, the president said in his letter that if this does not pass, the economy -- there's a risk that the economy will slide back into recession. Do you agree?

BOEHNER: Listen, I'm concerned about the plight of teachers, firemen, policemen who face the real possibility that they may be laid off, but to send this letter up here on a Saturday night with no opportunity to cut spending elsewhere in the budget strikes me as a little different. Steny and I and other leaders were at the White House on Thursday, and this subject never came up.

There was no indication this was going to happen. And I'm asking myself, why is this happening on Saturday night?

Fact is that the spending spree in Washington is continuing to run unabated. The American people are screaming at the top of their lungs, ""Stop!"" And -- and to move this without finding other offsets in spending, I think, is irresponsible. It's just putting more debt on the backs of our kids and our grandkids, and it really begs the question is, why don't we have a budget this year?

You know, we've not cut -- the House has failed -- not failed in the modern era to move a budget. And this appears to be the first time in the modern era that the House is not even going to consider a budget.

TAPPER: Well, Leader Hoyer, if I could...

(CROSSTALK)

TAPPER: ... if I could say, one of the -- the theory is that you don't want to make vulnerable Democrats vote for another spending bill, and that's why for the first time since 1974 there isn't going to be a House budget. Is that not true?

HOYER: Whatever -- whatever the theory may be, Jake, the fact of the matter is, my friend, Mr. Boehner, voted for $2 trillion during the Bush administration of unfunded spending. So when he says this cascade of spending, he...

(CROSSTALK)

TAPPER: But you agree that this should be offset with spending cuts?

HOYER: I would hope that we could do that, yes. However, what I said was, money that has already been appropriated in the Recovery and Reinvestment Act that has not yet been spent could be spent now on these priority items. Nobody wants to see $300,000 teachers or fire and police laid off. That's not good for the economy; it's not good for our kids; it's not good for the safety of our communities.

So the president's absolutely right in terms of this being critically important spending, and we're going to work on getting that. I personally believe that if we have dollars that are not yet expended in the Recovery Act that we can apply to this immediate need and then look to later expenditures in the long term for investments, I think we ought to do that. But we can't -- we can't stimulate and depress at the same time.

TAPPER: I'd like to -- I'd...

BOEHNER: Jake, every family knows that in a tough time it's more important to have a budget, not less. And if you think that they're going to move a budget on Capitol Hill, you must obviously believe that Elvis is still alive.

TAPPER: Well, I'd -- I'd like to move on to another topic...

HOYER: I know you do...

TAPPER: ... other than Elvis.

HOYER: ... but as you know, the Republicans didn't have a budget in '02, '04, '06.

BOEHNER: The House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era.

HOYER: And the American public had no idea about that, budgets that pass...

BOEHNER: Well, this is a great opportunity...

HOYER: ... and spending bills that follow (ph).

BOEHNER: ... to cut spending and to get the economy going again.

HOYER: And we're doing that.

BOEHNER: That's why I gave the president...

HOYER: Let me close with this.

BOEHNER: ... a letter this week with -- 100 economists signed a letter saying that cutting spending now will, in fact, help get the economy moving again, get jobs back...

(CROSSTALK)

TAPPER: I would like -- in terms of getting things moving again, I would like to move to another topic...

HOYER: Look, can I conclude on the deficit? Because the president -- we've adopted statutory PAYGO, which they jettisoned.

BOEHNER: And you've ignored it every time you've had a chance to use it.

TAPPER: All right, guys...

HOYER: The president sent down a freeze in spending. And he established a commission to look at long-term spending control. All of that is positive movement.

TAPPER: Let's move on to the oil spill.

BOEHNER: The American people want spending cut now.

TAPPER: Got it. Let's move on to the oil spill, because I want to get your reaction. On Tuesday, the BP chief operating officer, Doug Suttles, told the Associated Press that the flow ""should decrease to a relative trickle by Monday or Tuesday."" That's by tomorrow or the day after that, Doug Suttles said that.

I don't know what a relative anything means when it comes to this oil spill, but there's no indication that there's going to be -- it's only going to be trickling by tomorrow or the next day. And I just want to know, as the leaders of your respective parties on Capitol Hill, are you finding it tough to believe anything these guys from BP have to say anymore?

HOYER: Certainly BP has not been accurate in its representations. It has been misleading in its representations. What has happened is outrageous, and the American public are correctly very, very angry. And the administration has been marshalling every asset that we have available to work on this program.

I hope he's right. The American public hopes he's right. A trickle. I don't know what a trickle is. But certainly a very, very substantial reduction. BP said they could handle a 250,000-barrel spill. They have -- weren't able to handle what they said was initially a 5,000, which was -- what then went to 20,000 or 25,000 and now we think is a much greater spill than that.

BOEHNER: Well, Steny, guess what? I agree wholeheartedly with you. The American people want this oil leak stopped now. They want to know what happened. They want the gulf cleaned up. And they want it all done now.

And I just think that BP ought to be held responsible for all of the costs that are involved in this. I've said that right from -- from the beginning. And I continue to believe that.

I'm sure that the federal government, though, was -- isn't also responsible. The laws that were in place, the -- the materials that should have been in place for a spill this size were not, and the reaction, I think, on the part of the administration has been slow. But having said that, it's time to get this thing stopped now.

TAPPER: All right, just to...

HOYER: The only thing I would say to that, Jake...

TAPPER: ... just to clear up what you said earlier this week, on Thursday, you said that -- that BP and the federal government should take full responsibility. To clarify that, you think BP needs to pay?

BOEHNER: I've said from the beginning, BP needs to pay for the entire cost of this. But the federal government -- this is a failure of government. Government is there to protect our shores, to protect our environment. And there's been a real failure here.

We've been asking for 55 days, where's the inspection reports from this rig? The administration won't give them to us.

TAPPER: The Democrats are pushing a bill to lift the liability. Right now, it's at $75 million. Democrats are pushing a bill to lift the liability cap. Do you support that?

BOEHNER: I believe that lifting the liability cap on BP and for this spill is appropriate. I have concerns...

TAPPER: So lift it entirely for BP?

BOEHNER: Absolutely. They should be held responsible for every dime of this cost.

HOYER: Let me -- let me -- let me say a few words here. First of all, the Republicans have been holding up lifting the cap in the Senate from the $75 million, minuscule sum, as we see, to $10 billion.

Secondly, I think John Boehner is right in this respect: The psychology of neglect in terms of regulatory oversight that was pursued in the Bush administration, which led to the banking failure, insurance prices going way up, and oil companies thinking they could do whatever they wanted because the ""drill, baby, drill"" crowd, all they wanted them to do was to drill.

So I think John's right. I think the regularly psychology of the last administration was not appropriate, and there was mistakes made in this administration, as well.

BOEHNER: How long are you going to blame the Bush administration? Come on. What's going on over at MSS...

HOYER: As long as they're responsible, whether it's the economy...

BOEHNER: No, that's -- listen...

HOYER: ... or their lack of oversight, John, I'm going to do that.

BOEHNER: Where -- where -- when is someone...

HOYER: As appropriate (ph).

BOEHNER: ... in Washington going to -- Washington going to take responsibility for what they are in charge of?

TAPPER: I want to move on...

HOYER: And the administration has done that.

TAPPER: I want to move on to some foreign policy questions, but before I do, I just -- there -- there was a poll recently this week indicating that the American people rate the federal response to this oil spill as worse than the federal response to Katrina, 69 percent negative for the gulf oil spill, 62 percent negative for the government's response to Katrina. Do you rate the government's response to this oil spill as negative or positive?

HOYER: Absolutely not. I think that that's -- the American public are angry, rightfully so. BP was on site. The folks who own the rig, Halliburton, who constructed the piping, the concrete down there, they are responsible with the federal government was (ph).

Immediately upon this incident happening -- immediately...

TAPPER: So you think the government's responsible?

HOYER: ... the Coast Guard -- the Coast Guard was on site. Unfortunately, tragically, we lost 11 lives, but saved over 100 lives on site. Thad Allen, the admiral, immediately put in charge, 17,500 National Guard troops on duty right now.

TAPPER: OK.

HOYER: So there's been a vast response here. A natural disaster came along in Katrina, and, frankly, there were months before there was adequate response.

TAPPER: Leader Boehner, turning to Israel, a member of your leadership team, Congressman Mike Pence of Indiana, said this on Thursday.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PENCE: Remarkably, yesterday, the president said it was time for Israel to sharply limit its effective blockade in Gaza, saying, quote, ""The situation in Gaza is unsustainable."" The truth is, Mr. President, your policy in Israel is unsustainable. The American people are on the side of Israel and Israel's right to defend herself. Mr. President, whose side are you on?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TAPPER: Leader Boehner, is expressing concern about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza the same thing as being anti-Israel?

BOEHNER: Well, I think the Israelis have a clear right to -- to defend themselves. When you look at this flotilla that came over, the first five ships that were inspected, there was no -- there was no problem at all. It's pretty clear to many of us who've looked into this that this last ship was intended to be a problem, intended to cause a conflict.

And this is part of a much bigger problem that we see with the administration, where we've -- we've coddled our enemies and -- and pushed our friends aside in the process...

TAPPER: Leader Hoyer?

BOEHNER: ... raising a lot of doubts around the world, including the people of Israel, who are having serious doubts about our commitment to them, our closest ally in the Middle East.

HOYER: And I think one of the problems is, when you see Mr. Pence and you hear Mr. Boehner, this is not a partisan difference. Mr. Cantor and I had a colloquy on Thursday, which as John knows, I strongly support Israel's actions.

They told these folks, come here, you're not going to break the blockade. Why are you not going to break the blockade? Because Hamas, a terrorist organization, continues to attack civilians, men, women and children, in Israel.

And it is appropriate to have a blockade to make sure they don't get the weapons or other materials to effect those kinds of attacks, which are criminal, which are terrorist acts. So I think they did exactly the right thing in stopping that.

And in fact, in my view, the sixth ship, as John has pointed out, we agree on this, five ships were stopped without incident. This sixth ship was stopped. There's some reason to believe that that's exactly what they intended to do. Al Jazeera television showed attacks on the boarding party, and they responded in self-defense.

Turkey knew that if these ships came, it was going to be a problem. And the Israelis offered to allow the -- those ships to be offloaded at an Israeli port and all the humanitarian gear go into Gaza. That was the appropriate thing to do.

TAPPER: We only have one minute left, and I want to get your predictions for the midterm elections, literally one minute left. So...

HOYER: History says we're going to lose a few seats, but we're going to retain the House.

TAPPER: You're going to keep the House?

HOYER: We're going to keep the House.

TAPPER: Sir?

BOEHNER: Our goal is to take the majority in the House...

TAPPER: Not your goal. What's going to happen? Prediction. Prediction. You've said 100 seats. Can you do it?

BOEHNER: We've got -- we've got 100 seats in play. We have a real shot at winning a majority so that we can put a check on this administration and all the spending that's out of control here in Washington, D.C.

HOYER: Jake, they said that about Mark Critz in the 12th District of Pennsylvania. He won by 8 points.

TAPPER: All right.

HOYER: We're going to keep the House.

TAPPER: Leader Hoyer, Leader Boehner, thanks so much for joining us. I appreciate it.

TAPPER: Joining me now, Microsoft co-founder and chairman, Bill Gates.

Mr. Gates, thanks so much for joining us.

BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER & CHAIRMAN: Great to be here.

TAPPER: Obviously, the oil spill in the Gulf makes your proposal for $11 billion in energy innovation all the more resonant, all the more relevant. But I'm wondering, some are criticizing the president's handling of the federal response to the spill by saying he doesn't have executive experience and that's why he hasn't been able to -- to really get the federal bureaucracy moving the way it needs to.

As a former CEO, do you think there's anything to that at all?

GATES: Well, I think in any crisis like this, the key thing is to avoid them happening in the future. And I'm not an expert on oil recovery. BP is certainly incented to try and minimize the damage here in a very complex situation.

But how did we get an ener -- energy infrastructure that is this fragile?

You know, we've got a supply chain where we send a billion dollars a year overseas and you can imagine that there will be disruptions. When there have been in the past, we've always said, no, let's put a solution in place. But, in fact, the only real solution is to take American ingenuity and fund R &D to get energy in different forms that we're not sending this much money away and -- and that it's stable and reliable.

TAPPER: Well, let -- let's talk about that. Obviously, your proposal for $11 billion in additional spending for energy innovation, there's not a huge appetite right now among the American people for more spending with the record deficits we have.

Forgetting the merits of your proposal for a second, how politically feasible is it?

GATES: Well, I would distinguish between spending and investment. What we're talking about is about 1 percent of what the United States spends on energy, being devoted to R &D. And so if you find a way out of the energy sector to raise that 1 percent, which is not some huge increase in the costs there, then you can tap into the unique ability in this country, through its universities, the national labs and entrepreneurs, to give us a form of energy that is both cheaper, not dependent on foreign supply and is environmentally designed so that we're not emitting carbon and getting into the climate change problem.

The only way you get those things is through the breakthroughs. And I'm optimistic they're there, but we're not making the investment. Today we spend only about $4 billion on energy R &D compared to $30 billion on health, $80 billion on -- on defense."	0

In addition, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, both 23, will release the city and employees of all claims in exchange for the creation of a $200,000 fund that, through the help of a nonprofit organization, will assist young entrepreneurs in Philadelphia.

Robinson and Nelson will also serve on a committee to establish and award the grants, which will focus on starting a pilot curriculum for public high school students to attain the skills to become business owners.

Good for Nelson, Robinson, and the city of Philadelphia in turning this into a positive moment.

55	"As expected, Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, has announced that he is running for president. And we already know what his campaign will be about: faith in miracles.

Some of these miracles will involve things that youÃ¢ÂÂre liable to read in the Bible. But if he wins the Republican nomination, his campaign will probably center on a more secular theme: the alleged economic miracle in Texas, which, itÃ¢ÂÂs often asserted, sailed through the Great Recession almost unscathed thanks to conservative economic policies. And Mr. Perry will claim that he can restore prosperity to America by applying the same policies at a national level.

So what you need to know is that the Texas miracle is a myth, and more broadly that Texan experience offers no useful lessons on how to restore national full employment.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs true that Texas entered recession a bit later than the rest of America, mainly because the stateÃ¢ÂÂs still energy-heavy economy was buoyed by high oil prices through the first half of 2008. Also, Texas was spared the worst of the housing crisis, partly because it turns out to have surprisingly strict regulation of mortgage lending."	0
56	"UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has welcomed news of the arrival in the United States this week of the 10,000th refugee from the conflict in Syria, and calls for greater global solidarity ahead of summits next month that will look at ways to increase efforts to deal with the unprecedented refugee crisis worldwide.

Ã¢ÂÂThe United States has long been a leader in welcoming people fleeing global persecution and the arrival on Monday of the 10,000th Syrian refugee is a further expression of this leadership,Ã¢ÂÂ said UNHCR Regional Representative in the United States, Shelly Pitterman.

Ã¢ÂÂWe thank the communities in the United States that have kept their doors open and also our civil society partners for their tireless humanitarian efforts. Much more needs to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis that has seen more people flee persecution than at any time ever recorded.Ã¢ÂÂ

At the end of 2015, war, conflict and persecution had forced 65.3 million people globally to flee for their lives, an all-time high. The Syrian refugee crisis is the worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest and more than 4.8 million have fled mostly to neighbouring countries whose resources are stretched thin so that increasing numbers of refugees live below national poverty lines.

To aid the most vulnerable refugees and to share the tremendous burden of these refugee-hosting countries, UNHCR has called on governments to resettle those most at risk. So far resettlement countries have pledged a total of more than 220,000 places for Syrians under resettlement and other humanitarian admissions programmes. Around 478,000 Syrians are considered to be in need of resettlement Ã¢ÂÂ close to 40 per cent of the 1.19 million people who are in need of resettlement globally.

UNHCR recognizes that opportunities for resettlement are extremely limited and so reserves this for persons who are most at risk, such as unaccompanied children, women-headed households, victims of torture, and persons with special medical needs. UNHCR identifies and carefully screens all refugees before they are referred to a country for resettlement. In the case of the United States, all refugees who are referred then undergo extensive face-to-face interviews with Department of Homeland Security officers, along with multiple layers of identity and security checks in a thorough process undertaken by US authorities.

UNHCR calls for increased efforts to provide Syrian refugees with additional safe and regular pathways for admission. The United Nations General Assembly Summit for Refugees and Migrants on 19 September and the President of the United States Summit on Refugees on 20 September will provide opportunities for countries to show solidarity with refugee-hosting countries across the globe by giving Syrian and other vulnerable refugee groups legal opportunities to access safety and protection through resettlement and other pathways for admission.

Ã¢ÂÂResettling refugees, along with continued humanitarian funding, is a critical form of solidarity with refugee-hosting countries and it needs to be expanded worldwide,Ã¢ÂÂ said Pitterman."	0
57	"Ravi Bhalla was elected HobokenÃ¢ÂÂs 39th Mayor on November 7, 2017 out of a field of six candidates. Born and raised in New Jersey, Mayor Bhalla is a 17 year resident of Hoboken and eight year member of the Hoboken City Council.

He received his undergraduate education from the University of California at Berkeley, where he received a B.A. in Political Psychology. Upon graduation, he attended the London School of Economics (L.S.E.) in the United Kingdom and received a Master of Science degree in Public Administration and Public Policy, and also earned a Juris Doctor Degree from Tulane Law School in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Ravi first set his roots in Hoboken at the age of 26, a bachelor fresh out of law school starting his first job at a small law firm in Newark, New Jersey. Ravi earned national recognition in the New York Times for his legal advocacy after suffering a violation of his own constitutional and civil rights during a jail visit to a client. The incident motivated Ravi to lead a successful campaign to reform the federal governmentÃ¢ÂÂs visitation policies at correctional facilities nationwide.

Ravi married his wife Bindya, and they had two children, Arza and Shahbegh. It was during this time that HobokenÃ¢ÂÂs local government was in dire straits. He observed and witnessed mismanaged government at the local level, including a government budget that was underfunded and overspent by $12 million, a state takeover of Hoboken, and a 70% spike in municipal taxes in a single year.

Ravi ran for Council alongside Mayor Zimmer and worked tirelessly to get their message out of restoring honesty, professionalism and fiscal responsibility to Hoboken. Out of twelve candidates vying for 3 council-at-large positions, Ravi received the highest number of votes, as a first time candidate for office.

Once in office, Ravi worked hard alongside Mayor Zimmer and his council colleagues to establish tangible reforms to the way government is run in Hoboken. Municipal taxes were reduced and HobokenÃ¢ÂÂs finances were put on a responsible long-term path. The CityÃ¢ÂÂs bond rating was improved from junk bond status in 2009 to AA+ in 2013, the second highest rating, and had a responsible cash surplus for the first time in years.

Ravi was a leading voice on the council for securing the necessary funding for HobokenÃ¢ÂÂs second flood pump in Northwest Hoboken, advocated with Mayor Zimmer for the addition of 9 acres of open space, ensured our parks were built with detention systems to help alleviate flooding, voted to add progressive transportation options including corner cars and bike share, and played a large role in saving the hospital from closing in 2013, preserving more than 1,200 jobs and relieving taxpayers of a $52 million bond guarantee. Ravi currently sits as a co-chair of the CityÃ¢ÂÂs Rebuild by Design project, in which the City was awarded $230 million to comprehensively protect Hoboken from storm surge events like Superstorm Sandy.

Ravi served as Council President from 2011-2012 and Council Vice-President from 2010-2011 & 2013-2014 and was Chairman of the Hoboken Democratic Party from 2010-2011. Prior to his service as a Councilman, Mr. Bhalla served as a local Democratic Committeeman for the 2nd Ward, 3rd District of Hoboken from 2007-2009.

Ravi and his wife Bindya reside on Garden Street with their two children, Arza Kaur, age 10 and Shabegh Singh, age 5."	1

Nevada Caucuses Coverage - 2200 Hour; Romney Wins Nevada; Rick Santorum Interviwewed; Mitt Romney's Remarks

Aired February 04, 2012 - 22:00 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: CNN projects Mitt Romney the winner, the winner of the Nevada caucuses. CNN projects that the former Massachusetts governor has a decisive win in the caucuses in Nevada. Mitt Romney going ahead, capitalizing on his dramatic win in Florida, now capturing Nevada as well.



We do not -- we do not yet know who's going to come in second, who's going to come in third. But there is a dramatic -- a dramatic race under way for second and third place. But now you can see Romney headquarters in Las Vegas. The crowd hearing the news that Mitt Romney has won the Nevada caucuses. Very, very excited.



Jim Acosta is our man over at Mitt Romney headquarters in Las Vegas.



Jim, the crowd pretty excited there, as they should be.



JIM ACOSTA, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf. This is a very pumped up crowd. It's also a very big crowd. You know, we talked over the last couple of weeks that this campaign that Mitt Romney has at times had trouble drawing large crowds. That is not the case tonight. It's a very big boisterous crowd here for the former Massachusetts governor.



And, you know, we are expecting to see Mitt Romney come out here and address this crowd within the hour. It was thought that he might come on in about an hour from now, but they might move things up a little sooner. They obviously have some ground to cover over the next couple of days.



And I will tell you that one interesting thing, I think, that you can point to from the Romney campaign, a sign of confidence perhaps is they're kind of taking a day off tomorrow, Wolf, after they wrap up this day. They're having a down day here in Las Vegas. They're probably going to watch a football game tomorrow.



But then it's off to Colorado to get ready for the Tuesday caucuses in that state. But you can hear the crowd chanting behind me, ""Mitt, Mitt, Mitt."" This is a very happy crowd here tonight and for good reason. Mitt Romney is doing something tonight that he hasn't done in this campaign so far -- that's win two in a row -- Wolf.



BLITZER: The event tonight, where you are, where in Las Vegas are you, at a casino, a hotel?



ACOSTA: We are. We're at the Red Rock Casino, sort of on the western edge of Las Vegas, out by those Red Rock canyons, which is so beautiful here in this state. And, you know, it's been one of those crowds that we -- they've been waiting outside of this ballroom for the last couple of hours to get in, and they sort of letting those crowd in about 30 minutes ago. And you can see, you know, people of all shapes and sizes coming in here, families.



There's also a good sizable crowd of Mormon supporters for Mitt Romney. That's not too surprising. And according to all of our entrance polls, 26 percent, 27 percent of these Republican voters who are casting their votes for Mitt Romney in these caucuses are from the LDS Church and some of those folks here tonight as well, Wolf.



BLITZER: A lot of supporters of Mitt Romney out in Las Vegas tonight. A dramatic win for Mitt Romney coming on the heels of a dramatic win in Florida, earlier New Hampshire, almost in Iowa.



Soledad, let's send it over to you. Big night for Mitt Romney.



SOLEDAD O'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, it was. Gloria Borger, David Gergen joining me now. The victory was not a surprise. From the get- go, we knew that he was way ahead in the polls, most likely would win, and the percentage was what we're going to look for. What's the big take away then?



DAVID GERGEN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER: But it's still a very significant night, and that is Mitt Romney has now won three out of five all together. He's got the last two. He's got two big battleground states in a row.



And in looking towards the fall, Republicans want a nominee who can compete very, very well in a battleground state. There are about a dozen of them. There are a couple more coming up. There's a good chance Mitt Romney is going to win both of those. And that's going to put him in an even more commanding position.



The question has still -- is out there, though, is the turnout down significant tonight? What should we read into that? We're learning that as the night goes on.



O'BRIEN: And there's some early indication in rural areas that it's down 20 percent, which is a huge number.



GERGEN: Yes. His unfavorables have gone up nationally. He is, you know, locked in tight races with some of these battleground states with Obama head to head. But there are some things that are changing in this in terms of he has to pay a lot of attention to. If he can win and wrap this up fairly quickly, it will allow him to pivot and do more than essentially beat up on Obama.



I think he's got to present himself as a much fuller candidate. He's got to connect in ways far beyond what he's done so far. He's got to be listening and related to people who are, you know, lower income people, working people.



O'BRIEN: So he has to shed Santorum and shed Gingrich before he can do \that. GLORIA BORGER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I mean, if the key point you were making is it has to be wrapped up ...



GERGEN: Yes.



BORGER: ...and from what we've heard from Newt Gingrich's daughters and from our own reporting is that Newt Gingrich is resetting his campaign, and that's probably what we're going to hear about tonight. That we've learned he's been meeting not only with campaign donors today, but also with top staff to figure out what he does going forward.



Does he become a more positive candidate again? Remember, he started out positive, went negative, maybe positive again. And how does he proceed to talk about the Reagan legacy...



GERGEN: Yes.



BORGER: ...which he says is what he represents?



GERGEN: And one last point on this. What you can see happening as he emerges as the all but certain nominee, you can see the Obama forces and the left in general, the press in general, starting to gang up on him and they're going to try to define him.. A lot of people will gang up on Romney. He's got to be able to take that on. He can't spend all of his time worried about Santorum and Gingrich.



O'BRIEN: As we move forward, let's talk about the next contest. Jessica Yellin is at the White House for us.



And, of course, that would be Colorado, Jessica, which, of course, is a very strong state for President Obama.



JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: It is -- or was a strong state for President Obama, Soledad. You remember he held the convention, the Democratic convention there four years ago. It was a purple state -- we always like to call it that -- that he won.



But now it's, you know, up for grabs and it will be one of those states that both men, whoever the nominee on the Republican side is, will fight to hold and it will be one of those decisive states.



Now, the Obama team thinks that if they can pick up, for example, Nevada, Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa, New Hampshire, those states cobbled together could make up for, say, a loss in Ohio, if they have to put up with that, and still get a victory and win the White House in November. So they're looking at different alternative ways to win in November.



O'BRIEN: Jessica Yellin at the White House.



You know, the inevitability thing, if there's something that's been proven over the last maybe two, three weeks, maybe even a month, is that that does not just work.



BORGER: It doesn't work. You know, it's funny, because I think when the Romney campaign started, there was this sort of air of inevitability about him. And what the people...



O'BRIEN: Connected to electability.



BORGER: Sure, it's connected to electability. But what the people in the campaign learned very quickly is that inevitability is not a campaign message. That voters actually think they ought to be able to vote and decide who's going to become the candidate.



So, inevitability in and of itself is not a message. What he has to play upon is what you just mentioned -- I'm the most electable in these swing states, look at my numbers against Barack Obama.



But, again, he's still going to have to pay some attention to Newt Gingrich and to Rick Santorum, who will both be out there criticizing him as just more Obama.



GERGEN: I agree with you, Soledad. It's just been a lot of volatility and unpredictability about this and they could well continue. But think about this. A couple of weeks ago, there was a very plausible path for Newt Gingrich to the nomination. That seems less plausible tonight.



BORGER: Much less.



GERGEN: There is no plausible path that I can see for Ron Paul to get the nomination. It's increasingly impossible that Rick Santorum can win the nomination. So, yes, I can't see Mitt Romney losing it, but it's hard to see these other guys winning it. You know, that's why I think it becomes...



BORGER: But the question is, what damage do they do to Mitt Romney along the way?



GERGEN: I agree with that totally.



O'BRIEN: Yes, that is something...



GERGEN: Very good point.



O'BRIEN: Wolf Blitzer has a close look inside the victory tonight.



Wolf?



BLITZER: A dramatic victory for Mitt Romney. We're getting ready to hear from the Republican presidential candidate.



These folks are standing by, John. Let's go behind this dramatic win by Mitt Romney in Nevada tonight.



JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR: And, Wolf, to David Gergen's point. Part of this is psychology. Governor Romney trying to convince the Republican electors, even those who don't love him, look, I've got this wrapped up, and look, a big win in Florida, now a big win in Nevada.



Let's take a look at entrance poll in Nevada, now an exit poll. This is the way they showed up front. Who won among moderate and liberal voters? Republicans who showed up and described themselves as moderate or liberal Republicans, Governor Romney did.



Who won among Republicans who showed up at the caucus describing themselves as somewhat conservative? Governor Romney did.



Who won among those who described themselves as very conservative? Governor Romney did. And that's very important because that's the place he's been weaker in previous states.



What about the big issues? You see no faces here. That's because such a small percentage said abortion was an issue or illegal immigration. The two biggest issues were the economy and the budget deficit, both of those won by Governor Romney.



If you look right here, who has the right experience? Governor Romney. Strong moral character. Voters who said that was the most important to their choice -- Governor Romney.



Who is the true conservative? Here's one weak spot. Ron Paul won among a small group that said that was their number one priority. This 45 percent of the voters in the Nevada caucus said this was their number one priority.



And again, Governor Romney winning among those who say defeating President Obama was the top priority, getting almost three out of every four votes. Speaker Gingrich, a distant second. This has been Gingrich's strength in the State of South Carolina, Wolf. The voters there thought he was more electable and that was important. Now, two states in a row have said Governor Romney and here in Nevada tonight, by a huge margin.



Let's just look at one more as we come down the line here. If you look here among faith, obviously Governor Romney is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He's a Mormon, and he won big among Mormons. He won 9 out of every 10 votes among Mormons. Congressman Paul coming in second place. But he also won those who say they have no religion, voted for Congressman Paul.



But others Christians, Mormons, Catholics, Mainline Protestants, all going for Governor Romney. This is a sweep across the electorate tonight. Some would say, well, it was a state he won in 2008, so what, who cares?



But the point, beginning February with a win and a big win, starts the process in which team Romney thinks they could run the entire month, perhaps losing in Maine to Ron Paul. The psychology is going to kick in at some point.



Speaker Gingrich says he has a delegate strategy. He's in to Tampa. That's to try to convince fundraisers, if the next few weeks are pretty tough, keep sending me money. That's a tough argument to make.



BLITZER: And as I said, Romney getting ready to speak to his supporters out in Las Vegas. And at some point, Newt Gingrich is going to have a news conference in Last Vegas. But I want to go to the White House right now. Jessica Yellin is standing by.



Jessica, you and I know, John knows, everyone in Washington knows that the Obama re-election campaign for a long time has simply assumed that Mitt Romney would get the Republican nomination. They've been fighting him for a long time.



YELLIN: They have and this has been a good week for them on that front, Wolf, because Mitt Romney essentially handed them a series of campaign commercials. In a sense, he locked in the campaign message that they want to do. They want a contrast campaign, as we've been talking about, on the economy, where they can say that Mitt Romney is out of touch with regular folks.



And by giving that interview with Soledad, no matter what the Romney campaign wants to say about taking it out of context, etcetera, it locks in this narrative that the Obama team wants to run with, that he is out of touch. And no matter what they say, they can at least replay those sound bites in a stream with, ""I like to fire people,"" and ""I'm not worth that much money"" or whatever he'd said in a campaign ad that will be played over and over. You can bet, Wolf.



BLITZER: All right, Jessica, stand by. We're going to be coming back to you. We're also standing by to hear from Mitt Romney. He's going to be speaking to his supporters in Las Vegas at that hotel. That's coming up fairly soon. The crowd is excited. We have projected that Mitt Romney is the winner of the Nevada caucuses. At some point later, there will be a news conference by Newt Gingrich. We'll take that live as well. You'll hear the questions from reporters, his answers. He supposedly has a new strategy, is about to unveil tonight to try to get the Republican presidential nomination.



I'll speak with Rick Santorum, the Republican presidential candidate. We're standing by for that. Also there's a special caucus under way in Las Vegas. Right now there's some surprise developments happening right now. You're looking at live pictures from this caucus. We're going to go there. You're going to want to see this. Our coverage will continue from the CNN election center right after this.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



BLITZER: Mitt Romney is the winner of the Nevada caucuses. CNN has made that projection. We're going to be hearing from Mitt Romney. He is getting ready to speak to supporters at this hotel in Las Vegas. Stand by for that.



Newt Gingrich not the winner of the Nevada caucuses. He's going to hold a news conference at some tonight. We're going to have that live. He's taking questions from reporters, supposedly will outline a new strategy going forward. I'll also be interviewing Rick Santorum, the Republican presidential candidate. Stand by for that as well.



The votes, let's take a look at the votes right now as we actually have them with 13 percent of the vote in. Mitt Romney decisively ahead of Newt Gingrich, 47 percent to 22 percent. A battle, though, under way for second place. Ron Paul, right now with 13 percent of the vote in, coming in third at 19 percent. Rick Santorum at 12 percent. But a very impressive win for Mitt Romney in Nevada right now.



There's actually a special caucus that's been taking place in Las Vegas and it's a fascinating development. Our own Paul Steinhauser is standing by with some details of this.



Paul, tell us what's happening at this special caucus.



PAUL STEINHAUSER, CNN DEPUTY POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Wolf, this special caucus was supposed to start at the top of the hour and as you can see, no action yet. People are starting to file into the auditorium here at the Adelson Educational Complex, named after Sheldon Adelson who donated a lot of money to build this school.



Here's the thing, Wolf. To take part in this caucus, you have to have to get into -- you have to sign this affidavit to get in, Wolf. And two things you have to sign, you have to say that you didn't take part earlier today in the caucuses in Clark County. They started at 9:00 a.m. local time. And you also have to say the reason you didn't take part and vote in the presidential preference poll in the earlier caucuses is because of your religious beliefs. This caucus is basically for a lot of Orthodox and other very observant Jews, Seventh Day Adventists and others who could not take part during the Sabbath until sun down was over.



OK, so that's the story. Why it hasn't started yet. Still about 200 people to come in. But there was a little bit of fireworks about a half hour ago, Wolf. A guy called Evan Donahue, he says he's a delegate for Ron Paul. He says he's a volunteer for the Paul campaign out here in Nevada. He was not allowed in because, obviously, he had already voted and he was not an observant Jew or a Seventh Day Adventist. There was a scuffle and take a listen how it played out.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This building is private property. You are making me very upset, sir. I'm not going nowhere. You're not taking me anywhere. All of you folks are committing a felony. This says, conducted openly in such a manner that it's open to any registered voter. I am a registered voter, sir. I want to see what is going on in there. You are not making me leave. I am not leaving. I am not leaving. I will never leave. You will never stop me. I am here to defend democracy and I want to see what's going on.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



STEINHAUSER: Well, Donahue says that the practices here by the Nevada GOP are discriminatory because to get in you have to sign this affidavit. The Nevada GOP is here, as well, obviously, the Clark County GOP, and they say, listen, this is a caucus, it's run by the party, party rules.



Well, Evan Donahue is right here behind me right now. He is here. He says he's here to observe and we'll see what happens.



Wolf? BLITZER: So there's one thing, just to be precise, one thing to actually vote in this special caucus, it's another thing to just go in and observe what's going on. That's what this Ron Paul supporter wanted to do. He didn't vote. He already voted. He was just there to observe, is that right?



STEINHAUSER: That's what he says. But just to get into the room, you have to sign this affidavit. So, according to the Nevada, you know, the Clark County rules, he shouldn't be in the room right now because he already voted earlier in the day. A lot of other people have been turned away, Wolf, because they voted and couldn't sign this affidavit and still about 100 or 200 people out there waiting to get in, so we haven't started yet here, Wolf.



BLITZER: We'll stay in close touch with you. Paul Steinhauser, thanks very, very much.



We're waiting to hear from Mitt Romney. He's the winner of the Nevada caucuses. He's getting ready to speak to his supporters at a hotel in Las Vegas.



Once again, later, Newt Gingrich is not going to be speaking to supporters, he's going to be answering questions from reporters. He's getting ready to hold a news conference. We'll take that live, as well.



I'll be speaking with Rick Santorum, another of the four remaining Republican presidential candidates. Earlier, I spoke with Ron Paul. Our special coverage will continue right after this.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



BLITZER: Check it out, two very different pictures over here. The Romney headquarters at a hotel in Las Vegas. Lots of supporters getting ready to hear from the winner of the Nevada caucuses. That would be Mitt Romney.



Over here on the right, Newt Gingrich headquarters, not a big crowd up there. No crowd at all. He's not going to give a speech. He's going to do a news conference. He's going to answer reporters' questions, supposedly getting ready to unveil a new strategy he wants to implement in the struggle to get the Republican presidential nomination.



We'll see both of those events live. We'll also speak with Rick Santorum at some point tonight. We spoke earlier with Ron Paul. In the meantime, let's check back with Soledad.



Soledad, big huge night for Mitt Romney. Not necessarily so good for the other candidates, but there is still a fierce battle under way for second place in Nevada.



O'BRIEN: Yes, absolutely. I think those pictures behind you kind of say it all, don't they? The cheering Romney supporters. And then, waiting for a president, for a Newt Gingrich.



Let's bring you right to the contributors.



The Mormons really delivered for Mitt Romney as we look through the entrance polls. We know that they were able to deliver. Is there anything that you can take from what we know about Mormon response, Mormon commitment to Mitt Romney that you can say and transpose to the general election?



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think when you get into the general election, it becomes more -- they become your typical Republican voter, but they're also a funding source for the Romney campaign.



O'BRIEN: OK. So, funding. Organization?



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Organization will be a good thing for the Mormons. In fact, that was a selling point for Romney, although it didn't pan out for the primaries in 2008. That was one selling point a lot of people made is the way Mormons organize around the country. Those voters, young students will be able to help him. I don't know that that's true as much as hype.



O'BRIEN: David Gergen talked a little about this sort of national polls, you see Mitt Romney going down, down, down, even though he's becoming more and more sort of the de facto candidate. And when you ask the question, can the candidate connect with -- understand the problems of America? With President Obama, the polls are like at 55 percent and Mitt Romney polling at the end of January around 39 percent. How big a problem is that?



ROLAND MARTIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, first of all, it's no shock his numbers will be going down because as you get deeper into a primary, his negatives naturally go up, because you have the attacks going back and forth, you have the ads, you have Newt Gingrich slinging arrows, get Rick Santorum in his speech tonight condemning, of course, the health care plan in Massachusetts.



So, people begin to hear more about you. He is going to have an issue when it comes to connecting with voters. I go back to -- when he goes into Ohio and Pennsylvania and he goes into Michigan, what is he going to say to those voters? How is he going to say, oh, before when I say it, look, let the market take over when it comes to foreclosures, but you're under water. What did I say before when I say let GM go into bankruptcy, but down to automakers. He has to deal with that. Those are real blue collar workers. If he doesn't make the arguments to them, how is he going to win them over to ...



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's already having trouble connecting to the Republican base.



MARTIN: So I'm saying.



UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And this is critical for the general election. That's why I keep saying that his win tonight really doesn't have any implications for the general elections other than negative ones I think because he's shown that he can't win the Latino vote.



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to say I disagree. (CROSSTALK)



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Me thinks he lost this primary tonight listening to you guys.



(CROSSTALK)



UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's right. And to Roland's point, when a voter goes into the voting booth to vote and many studies have been done about this, they vote on their gut. And right now President Obama is winning that battle of who is going to be the candidate who is going to fight for you, who understands what you're going through, and who is going to put forth policies that is going to fight for you.



And that really, that's not just a talking point. If you look at Mitt Romney's plan, his economic plan, a tax cut for middle class families, $167. A tax cut for millionaires, $146,000. That's the reality that he's got to contend with.



O'BRIEN: It does make it sound like he lost today, when actually not only did he win, he won by a lot.



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But his percentage is lower this year than in 2008.



(CROSSTALK)



WILL CAIN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: It reinforces what Gloria talked about, David talked about. This word we've been batting around for months now of inevitability. When he's now winning tea party supporters, when he's now winning very conservative voters, it reinforces this. He is going to be the nominee. It reinforces inevitability.



O'BRIEN: Wolf Blitzer's got Rick Santorum now. Wolf?



BLITZER: Let's talk to Rick Santorum, Pennsylvanian senator, the Republican presidential candidate. He's joining us right now.



Senator, thanks very much for coming in. You're in Colorado. Already didn't waste any time in Nevada. I suspect when you realized you weren't going to do all that well in Nevada, that's why you got out and look ahead to Tuesday's contest in Colorado.



RICK SANTORUM (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, absolutely. I mean, you know, we're playing the demographics, you're playing on Mitt's home court in Nevada. He spent a lot of money, a lot of time there. He's been campaigning there really for five years and organizing, you know, as has Ron Raul. I mean, those are -- these early states, these first five states, you know, there's an inherent advantage to the folks who have run before, that have spent a lot of time and money in those states.



And now we're moving out to states where they had to play sort of catch up four years ago and didn't have the organization, didn't have the strength, didn't run the campaign commercials and didn't have the strong identity. And so we think this is an opportunity for us for this race to begin to turn and begin to come toward our direction.



BLITZER: Have you had the chance to call Mitt Romney and congratulate him yet?



SANTORUM: As a matter of fact, I just got off -- I just gave a speech here in Greeley, Colorado and did a couple of interviews and now I'm doing yours. So I really haven't had a moment to do so. And I understand he's going to speak here in a minute. So I'll try to reach him maybe after he gets off the platform.



BLITZER: But you will call him? I ask the question only because Newt Gingrich has made a point of not calling him to congratulate him after he won in Florida. But you will call him to congratulate?



SANTORUM: Look, you know, one of the things I feel very strongly about is that politics is a rough enough game that it shouldn't be personal. And that when someone has an accomplishment, if someone beats you fair and square, you pick up the phone and you give him a call and you congratulate him for his good work. And we'll see him on the campaign trail.



BLITZER: You know, I can't tell you how many people, so-called experts, pundits, analysts, Senator, have said to be the reason that Rick Santorum is staying in the race is that in case Newt Gingrich were to drop out, he could then emerge as the non-Mitt Romney, the so- called real conservative and develop a real challenge to Mitt Romney. Is that the way you're thinking?



SANTORUM: I think, eventually, as I said before, this race will come toward us. We're the candidate that provides the real best perspective of beating Barack Obama. I think that's going to become more and more evident. It's just the opposite of what people actually thought at the beginning of this race. I think it's going to become clear.



Look at the latest Rasmussen Poll that has us beating Obama by a point and has Romney losing by three, Gingrich losing by eighth or nine. The more that this race goes on, the more people see that we present the best chance to win this and you get a twofer. Not only do you get the best chance to win, but you get the candidate who actually holds the values that Republicans generally speak in this country hold.



BLITZER: Tell us what's going to happen on Tuesday in Colorado, Minnesota, and Missouri.



SANTORUM: You know, I think, again, demographically, Colorado is not the best state for us, but I think we can do well here. I think we will do much better than we did in Nevada. I think we can do even better maybe in Minnesota, and Missouri is an interesting one, because Newt is not on the ballot and that presents an opportunity for a one- on-one match up in a state that's a pretty key swing state for Republicans, actually a must-win state for Republicans in this election cycle. So, we're optimistic that we're going to perform very, very well in all three of those states.



BLITZER: I'm going to let you go, but very quickly, your little daughter Bella, how is she doing?



SANTORUM: Well, thank you so much for asking, and she is doing just great. She's almost back to -- back as good as new. I just want to thank you and everybody again. It's been a -- and what a relief and thank you for your prayers and for helping us out. It's certainly given a little more hop in my steps these last few days.



BLITZER: Well, give her our love, as you know. Thanks very much, Senator. We'll talk to you on the campaign trail. Rick Santorum joining us from Colorado.



Soledad?



SOLEDAD O'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR: Gloria Borger, David Gergen, first of all, we heard from Rick Santorum just now. Ron Paul we heard from a little bit earlier. We're going to hear from Newt Gingrich. We're expecting that for long for now. Mitt Romney, though, will also be coming out to give his acceptance speech. What do we need to hear from him? What you expect to hear from him?



GLORIA BORGER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I expect him to just turn to Barack Obama. I think that he's not going to be talking about Newt Gingrich. He's going to be talking about what a great win this was. But I think he's just going to pivot and talk about Barack Obama, how he can take it to Barack Obama, how he will be better at fixing the economy and all of the things that we've already heard we will hear repeated again.



DAVID GERGEN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I think Gloria is basically right. That's what he did after his New Hampshire win. That's what he did after his Florida win. I would suggest though that's not what he should do tonight. Yes, he should take it to Barack Obama and probably is going to do some of that. But it's more important now that he begin making people understand what he would do, because, you know, he's got this big economic plan. I haven't met a single person that can tell you three things that they could just reel off and say here's what Mitt Romney would do if he will president.



BORGER: 59-point.



GERGEN: He has a 59-point plan. People don't -- you don't remember that. I can tell you when Reagan was running back in 1980, he had five things he was going to do, everybody knew what they were and he got a mandate out of it.



O'BRIEN: He's got to work on connecting with people.



GERGEN: He's got to work on connecting emotionally but also there has to be -- they've got a great line about being a takeover person, somebody who can turn things around. His son did that tonight and his wife Ann has been doing that. But he has now -- will have to sort of say, I can turn things around by doing the following.



O'BRIEN: Does an improving economy make that an even trickier pivot?



BORGER: It does because you have to be a little bit more nuisance to mean Republicans cannot be seen to be rooting against an economic recovery. Of course not. What Mitt Romney has said, and probably continues to say, is that Barack Obama hasn't made the recovery occur quickly enough and that it may not be sustained and if you do these 59 things, that maybe you will sustain.



But I think this is a point for all of these campaigns. We just heard from Rick Santorum. They're all now refining their message. Rick Santorum is saying, if Gingrich goes, I'm the anti-Romney candidate, and they believe that there's a base of support out there that is anti-Romney. Romney is, I can take on Obama. Newt Gingrich is, I'm the conservative in this race, I can beat...



GERGEN: Before we leave that -- Rick Santorum, we were"	0

View the video of this debate

LEHRER: Good evening from the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. I'm Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October. Tonight's will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis. It will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments. Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss. The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. They have not been shared or cleared with anyone. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain. (APPLAUSE) Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. Quote, ""We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength,"" end quote. With that in mind, the first lead question. Gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan? First response to you, Senator Obama. You have two minutes.

OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight. I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me? How's it going to affect my job? How's it going to affect my house? How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college? So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns. Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes. And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasn't worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight.

LEHRER: Senator McCain, two minutes.

MCCAIN: Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to everybody. And I do have a sad note tonight. Senator Kennedy is in the hospital. He's a dear and beloved friend to all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate. I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight. And, Jim, I -- I've been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But I'm feeling a little better tonight, and I'll tell you why. Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in. And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. We're talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don't fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I've been around a little while. But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package. This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it. And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem. But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isn't the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable. And we've got a lot of work to do. And we've got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.

LEHRER: All right, let's go back to my question. How do you all stand on the recovery plan? And talk to each other about it. We've got five minutes. We can negotiate a deal right here. But, I mean, are you -- do you favor this plan, Senator Obama, and you, Senator McCain? Do you -- are you in favor of this plan?

OBAMA: We haven't seen the language yet. And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there. So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan. The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place? Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it. So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that. But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.

LEHRER: Are you going to vote for the plan, Senator McCain?

MCCAIN: I -- I hope so. And I...

LEHRER: As a United States senator...

MCCAIN: Sure.

LEHRER: ... you're going to vote for the plan?

MCCAIN: Sure. But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae (NYSE:FNM) and Freddie Mac (NYSE:FRE) and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming. But there's also the issue of responsibility. You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy. Somehow we've lost that accountability. I've been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed. But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded. As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen.

LEHRER: Do you have something directly to say, Senator Obama, to Senator McCain about what he just said?

OBAMA: Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis. I mean, we've had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what's good for Wall Street, but not what's good for Main Street. And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place. And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.

LEHRER: Say it directly to him.

OBAMA: I do not think that they are.

LEHRER: Say it directly to him.

OBAMA: Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. And...

MCCAIN: Are you afraid I couldn't hear him? (LAUGHTER)

LEHRER: I'm just determined to get you all to talk to each other. I'm going to try.

OBAMA: The -- and I just fundamentally disagree. And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on. They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. We haven't been paying attention to them. And if you look at our tax policies, it's a classic example.

LEHRER: So, Senator McCain, do you agree with what Senator Obama just said? And, if you don't, tell him what you disagree with.

MCCAIN: No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system. We've got fundamental problems in the system. And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street. So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go. And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis. But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker. And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative. America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer. But we've got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America. And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.

LEHRER: All right, let's go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject. And you get two minutes to begin with, Senator McCain. And using your word ""fundamental,"" are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obama's approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?

MCCAIN: Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington. It's completely out of control. It's gone -- we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it's a gateway. It's a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption. And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending. You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money. And it has got to be brought under control. As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I've got a pen. This one's kind of old. I've got a pen, and I'm going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. I will make them famous. You will know their names. Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate. I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they'll look at those projects. That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. That's one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.

LEHRER: Senator Obama, two minutes.

OBAMA: Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up. And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me. But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget. Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out. So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent. And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.

LEHRER: Senator McCain?

MCCAIN: Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he... (CROSSTALK)

LEHRER: No, that's fine.

MCCAIN: Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States. He didn't happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests. Maybe to Senator Obama it's not a lot of money. But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time. ""It's only $18 billion."" Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years? Do you know that it's gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people? It corrupts people. That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges. It's a system that's got to be cleaned up. I have fought against it my career. I have fought against it. I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee. I didn't win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate. Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs. Now, that's a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. I want to cut spending. I want to keep taxes low. The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people's taxes.

OBAMA: I -- I don't know where John is getting his figures. Let's just be clear. What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage. I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it. But let's go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely. But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.

OBAMA: And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.

LEHRER: Respond directly to him about that, to Senator Obama about that, about the -- he's made it twice now, about your tax -- your policies about tax cuts.

MCCAIN: Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax. Right now, the United States of American business (OOTC:ARBU) pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent. Now, if you're a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it's 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you're going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera. I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs. But, again, I want to return. It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. I can tell you, it's rife. It's throughout. The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends. Look at them. You'll be appalled. And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects. So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America. I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of ""rich.""

LEHRER: Senator Obama, you have a question for Senator McCain on that? OBAMA: Well, let me just make a couple of points.

LEHRER: All right.

OBAMA: My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut. And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase. Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right. Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. It's not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And that's a problem. Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit. Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. It is not a good deal for the American people. But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.

MCCAIN: Well, you know, let me just...

LEHRER: We've got to go to another lead question.

MCCAIN: I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk. We had an energy bill before the United States Senate. It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments. It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth. I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.

OBAMA: John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.

MCCAIN: You've got to look at our record. You've got to look at our records. That's the important thing. Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending? Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control? Who's the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair? And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it. Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code. And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill. But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions. He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.

OBAMA: That's not true, John. That's not true.

MCCAIN: And that's just a fact. Again, you can look it up.

OBAMA: Look, it's just not true. And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody. But here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them. And...

MCCAIN: With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.

OBAMA: No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out. We've got an emergency bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.

LEHRER: All right. All right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue -- the financial rescue thing that we started -- started asking about. And what -- and the first answer is to you, Senator Obama. As president, as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion, $700 billion, whatever it is it's going to cost, what are you going to have to give up, in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the United States, as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan?

OBAMA: Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed. We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so it's hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year. But there's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done. We have to have energy independence, so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy (OOTC:AEGC) , solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we're developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea. We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families. They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. I'm meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off. The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education. We've got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science. And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America. And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities. Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them. So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We can't shortchange those things. We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.

LEHRER: Are you -- what priorities would you adjust, as president, Senator McCain, because of the -- because of the financial bailout cost?

MCCAIN: Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending. We have -- as I said, we've let government get completely out of control. Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate. It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government. First of all, by the way, I'd eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies. I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control. We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven't done it. So we need to have fixed-cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control. I know how to do that.

MCCAIN: I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years. But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren't and eliminate them and we'll have to scrub every agency of government.

LEHRER: But if I hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout? Is that what you're saying?

OBAMA: No. As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...

LEHRER: Like what?

OBAMA: ... deferred and delayed. Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil. That is a big project. That is a multi-year project.

LEHRER: Not willing to give that up?

OBAMA: Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do. But John is right we have to make cuts. We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system. Doesn't work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15 billion. That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works. They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture. Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal. Mostly that's just me opposing George Bush's wrong headed policies since I've been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I work with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John's been railing about.

LEHRER: What I'm trying to get at this is this. Excuse me if I may, senator. Trying to get at that you all -- one of you is going to be the president of the United States come January. At the -- in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved. And what I'm trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific -- small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency.

MCCAIN: How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.

LEHRER: Spending freeze?

MCCAIN: I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions the caring of veterans national defense and several other vital issues.

LEHRER: Would you go for that?

OBAMA: The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. There are some programs that are very important that are under funded. I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy doesn't make sense. Let me tell you another place to look for some savings. We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.

MCCAIN: Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don't like us very much. Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power. Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. You can't get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it's also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned and the issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with President Clinton.

LEHRER: Before we go to another lead question. Let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here. Are you -- are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already -- I mean, is it a major move? Is it going to have a major affect?

OBAMA: There's no doubt it will affect our budgets. There is no doubt about it. Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we' holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. If we're lucky and do it right, that could potentially happen but in the sho"	0

These adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.

Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.

WhatÃ¢ÂÂs in Tripedia?

According to the TripediaÃ¢ÂÂs package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.

What is the content of these two growth mediums?

Mueller and Miller medium contains:

Glucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution. Basically a mixture of sugar, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.

Tris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate (monosodium salt) [MSG], proline, salt, monopotassium phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, niacin, glutathione.

The vaccine is formulated without preservatives, but contains a trace amount of thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (Ã¢ÂÂ¤0.3 ÃÂ¼g mercury/dose)] from the manufacturing process. Each 0.5 mL dose also contains, by assay, not more than 0.170 mg of aluminum and not more than 100 ÃÂ¼g(0.02%) of residual formaldehyde. The vaccine contains gelatin and polysorbate 80 (Tween-80), which are used in the production of the pertussis concentrate.

62	"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.

The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole ""nay,"" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)

Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.

Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the ""black tar"" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from MexicoÃ¢ÂÂs border, we were skeptical.

Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement AdministrationÃ¢ÂÂs National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.

""Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,"" the report state. ""Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.""

The report also says that Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" (the DEAÃ¢ÂÂs term for drug-dealing gangs) ""pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.""

The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.

Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.

Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent.

SmugglersÃ¢ÂÂ creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.

Our ruling

Portman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been studying drug facts for nothing.

We rate this claim True."	0
63	"Immigration reform was a major component of President Barack Obama's campaign platform. He promised to secure the border, crack down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants, and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.



While watching ABC's This Week as part of our fact-checking partnership with the show, we learned of a promise that we hadn't heard before. During the campaign, then-candidate Obama was interviewed by Univision's Jorge Ramos, a prominent voice within the Latin American community. During that interview, Obama said he would pursue immigration reform aggressively. ""I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days,"" Obama said. ""But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.""



We checked our database of promises, and found that that while we did have promises from Obama on immigration reform, we missed this one with its specific deadline. So we're adding it, along with a rating.



Obama set a timetable for this promise, saying he would ""strongly support"" an immigration bill in his first year. But, well into his second year, no comprehensive immigration reform measure supported by Obama has been introduced in Congress.



We searched his speeches on VoteSmart.org and found numerous mentions of immigration reform. In April 2009, in response to a question about the one-year deadline, he said that he saw the ""process moving this first year."" In June 2009, he assigned Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to begin putting together a comprehensive immigration reform framework. Finally, in September 2009, he said that he anticipated ""that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.""



Alas, the year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On December 15, 2009, Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez introduced a bill of his own, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies said that Obama administration has not promoted or publicly supported Gutierrez's bill.



Over the course of 2010, Obama continued to push for immigration reform in his speeches. He mentioned it in his State of the Union address and announced in March that Senators Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., finished working on a bipartisan framework ""to fix our broken immigration system."" That was followed by a release of a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the President called a ""a very important step.""



Finally, Obama reiterated his call for bipartisan reform in a major speech at American University on July 1, 2010. ""In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we""ve seen across America. Some have rallied behind this new policy. Others have protested and launched boycotts of the state. And everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken,"" said Obama.



Obama promised to strongly support a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would be introduced during his first year in office. As president, he has repeatedly called for reform and several immigration-related bills are pending in Congress. But we're well into the second year of Obama's presidency, and all that we've seen are proposals and frameworks, no actual bills. Unless the White House has a time machine that we don't know about, this is a Promise Broken."	0
64	"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.

Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.

Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.

When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, Ã¢ÂÂThis is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.Ã¢ÂÂ

According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.

Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.

According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.

Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.

CLINTON: Thank you. (APPLAUSE)

Thank you all very much.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. Thank you all.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. Thank you. I am -- I'm absolutely -- I'm absolutely delighted to be back in Cleveland and to be here at the Industrial Innovation Center. I've had a chance to learn about the great work you do here. I especially want to applaud Team Wendy for everything you do to protect our troops, first responders.

(APPLAUSE)

And others from traumatic brain injury. It is so important that we continue to support those who protect us.

AUDIENCE: We want Hillary!

CLINTON: Thank you.

AUDIENCE: We want Hillary!

CLINTON: Thank you all.

AUDIENCE: We want Hillary!

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: It is good to be back in Cleveland, I can tell you that.

(APPLAUSE)

I want to thank -- I wan to thank your extraordinary senator, Sherrod Brown, for his leadership, for that very kind and generous introduction. You are very fortunate to -- to have him representing you. I want to thank your congresswoman, Marcia Fudge...

(APPLAUSE)

Who is both indomitable and indefatigable. She is such a tenacious advocate for the people she represents. I want to acknowledge the mayor, Mayor Jackson, who was here, County Executive Budish (ph). And I particularly want to recognize the passing of George Voinovich, and he devoted his life to serving the people of Ohio as mayor of Cleveland, as governor and senator. And we send our prayers and sympathy to his family.

I also want to thank Dan Moore, the owner and founder of this company and Team Wendy for his belief in Cleveland, for his commitment to create jobs. I can't wait to work with him to do more of what he has accomplished here.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, originally, I had intended to come to Cleveland under very different circumstances. We are heading into a general election that could be the most consequential of our lifetimes. But today is not a day for politics.

On Sunday, Americans woke up to a nightmare that's become mind numbingly familiar. Another act of terrorism in a place no one expected. A madman filled with hate, with guns in his hands, and just a horrible sense of vengeance and vindictiveness in his heart, apparently consumed by rage against LGBT Americans, and by extension, the openness and diversity that defines our American way of life.

We will learn more about the killer in the days to come. We know that he pledged allegiance to ISIS, that they are now taking credit and that part of their strategy is to radicalize individuals and encourage attacks against the United States, even if they are not coordinated with ISIS leadership. But there's a lot we still don't know, including what other mix of motives drove him to kill.

The more we learn about what happened, the better we'll be able to protect our people going forward. In the days ahead, we will also learn more about the many lives he viciously cut short, many of them young people, just starting out in their lives. They were travel agents and pharmacy techs, college students and amusement park workers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, and they had one thing in common. They all had a lot more to give.

CLINTON: We should take a moment today amid our busy lives to think about them, to pray for everyone who was killed, for the wounded, those who are fighting to regain their lives and futures, for our first responders who walked into danger one more time. As a mother, I can't imagine what those families are going through.

But let's also remember the other scenes we saw on Sunday. We saw the faces of some of those first responders who rushed into danger and tried to save as many people as they could. We saw survivors like Chris Hansen who risked their lives to help others.

People gathering outside hospitals to comfort anxious family members, waiting for news of their loved ones and waiting, too, to learn more about what they could do to make sure this never happened again.

Religion leaders condemning hate and appealing for peace. People lining up to donate blood. Americans refusing to be intimidated or divided.

Yesterday I called Mayor Dyer of Orlando and offered my support and my appreciation for the leadership that he and the other officials have shown. This is a moment when all Americans need to stand together.

No matter how many times we endure attacks like this, the horror never fades. The murder of innocent people breaks our hearts, tears at our sense of security and makes us furious.

Now we have to steal our resolve to respond. And that's what I want to talk to you about. How we respond.

The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive. And we must attack it with clear eyes, steady hands, unwavering determination and pride in our country and our values.

(APPLAUSE)

I have no doubt -- I have no doubt we can meet this challenge if we meet it together. Whatever we learn about this killer, his motives in the days ahead, we know already the barbarity that we face from radical jihadists is profound.

In the Middle East, ISIS is attempting a genocide of religious and ethnic minorities. They are slaughtering Muslims who refuse to accept their medieval ways. They are beheading civilians, including executing LGBT people. They are murdering Americans and Europeans, enslaving, torturing and raping women and girls.

Advertisement

In speeches like this one, after Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, I have laid out a plan to defeat ISIS and the other radical jihadist groups in the region and beyond.

The attack in Orlando makes it even more clear, we cannot contain this threat. We must defeat it. And the good news is that the coalition effort in Syria and Iraq has made recent gains in the last months.

So we should keep the pressure on ramping up the air campaign, accelerating support for our friends fighting to take and hold ground and pushing our partners in the region to do even more.

We also need continued American leadership to help resolve the political conflicts that fuel ISIS recruitment efforts.

But as ISIS loses actual ground in Iraq and Syria, it will seek to stage more attacks and gain stronger footholds wherever it can, from Afghanistan, to Libya, to Europe.

Advertisement

The threat is metastasizing. We saw this in Paris. And we saw it in Brussels. We face a twisted ideology and poisoned psychology that inspires the so-called lone wolves, radicalized individuals who may or may not have contact and direction from any formal organization.

CLINTON: So, yes, efforts to defeat ISIS on the battlefield must succeed. But it will take more than that.

(APPLAUSE)

Share this article Share

We have to be just as adaptable and versatile as our enemies. As president, I will make identifying and stopping lone wolves a top priority.

(APPLAUSE)

I will put a team together from across our government, the entire government, as well as the private sector and communities to get on top of this urgent challenge. And I will make sure our law enforcement and intelligence professionals have all the resources they need to get the job done.

Advertisement

As we do this, there are three areas that demand attention. First, we and our allies must work hand-in-hand to dismantle the networks that move money, and propaganda, and arms and fighters around the world.

(APPLAUSE)

We have to flow -- we have to stem the flow of jihadists from Europe and Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and then back again. The only way to do this is by working closely with our partners, strengthening our alliances, not weakening them or walking away from them.

Second, here at home, we must harden our own defenses. We have to do more to support our first responders, law enforcement and intelligence officers who do incredible work every day at great personal risk to keep our country safe.

(APPLAUSE)

I have seen firsthand how hard their job is, and how well they do it.

In Orlando, at least one police officer was shot in the head. Thankfully, his life was saved by a Kevlar helmet, something folks here at Team Wendy know a lot about.

(APPLAUSE)

It has often been said that our law enforcement, our intelligence agencies, our first responders have to be right 100 percent of the time, but terrorists only have to be right once.

What a heavy responsibility. These men and women deserve both our respect and gratitude. And they deserve the right tools, and resources and training. Too often, state and local officials can't get access to intelligence from the federal government that would help them do their jobs.

We need to change that. We also need to work...

(APPLAUSE)

We also need to work with local law enforcement and business owners on ways to protect vulnerable, so-called soft targets, like nightclubs and shopping malls and hotels and movie theaters and schools and houses of worship.

Now, I know a lot of Americans are asking how it was possible that someone already on the FBI's radar could have still been able to commit an attack like the one in Orlando, and what more we can do to stop this kind of thing from happening again.

Well, we have to see what the investigation uncovers. If there are things that can and should be done to improve our ability to prevent, we must do them. We already know we need more resources for this fight. The professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out.

That's why I have proposed an intelligence surge to bolster our capabilities across the board with appropriate safeguards here at home.

Even as we make sure our security officials get the tools they need to prevent attacks, it's essential that we stop terrorists from getting the tools they need to carry out the attack.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And that is especially true when it comes to assault weapons like those used in Orlando and San Bernardino.

(APPLAUSE)

I believe weapons of war have no place on our streets and we may have our disagreements about gun safety regulations, but we should all be able to agree on a few essential things.

If the FBI is watching you for a suspected terrorist link, you shouldn't be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.

And you shouldn't be able to exploit loopholes and evade criminal background checks by buying online or at a gun show.

And yes, if you're too dangerous to get on a plane, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in America.

Now, I know some will say that assault weapons and background checks are totally separate issues having nothing to do with terrorism. Well, in Orlando and San Bernardino terrorists used assault weapons, the AR-15. And they used it to kill Americans. That was the same assault weapon used to kill those little children in Sandy Hook.

We have to make it harder for people who should not have those weapons of war. And that may not stop every shooting or every terrorist attack, but it will stop some and it will save lives and it will protect our first responders.

And I want you to know, I'm not going to stop fighting for these kinds of provisions.

Now, the third area that demands attention is preventing radicalization and countering efforts by ISIS and other international terrorist networks to recruit in the United States and Europe.

For starters, it is long past time for the Saudis, the Qataris and the Kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations. And they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path towards extremism.

We also have to use all our capabilities to counter jihadist propaganda online. This is something that I spend a lot of time on at the State Department.

As president, I will work with our great tech companies from Silicon Valley to Boston to step up our game. We have to a better job intercepting ISIS' communications, tracking and analyzing social media posts and mapping jihadist networks, as well as promoting credible voices who can provide alternatives to radicalization.

And there is more to do offline as well.

CLINTON: Since 9/11, law enforcement agencies have worked hard to build relationships with Muslim American communities. Millions of peace-loving Muslims live, work and raise their families across America. And they are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects of radicalization before it's too late, and the best positioned to help us block it. So we should be intensifying contacts in those communities, not scapegoating or isolating them.

(APPLAUSE)

Last year, I visited a pilot program in Minneapolis that helps parents, teachers, imams, mental health professionals and others recognize signs of radicalization in young people and work with law enforcement to intervene before it's too late.

I've also met with local leaders pursuing innovative approaches in Los Angeles and other places. And we need more efforts like that in more cities across America. And as the director of the FBI has pointed out, we should avoid eroding trust in that community, which will only make law enforcement's job more difficult.

Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric and threatening to ban the families and friends of Muslim Americans as well as millions of Muslim business people and tourists from entering our country hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror.

(APPLAUSE)

So does saying that we have to start special surveillance on our fellow Americans because of their religion. It's no coincidence that hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques have tripled after Paris and San Bernardino. That's wrong. And it's also dangerous. It plays right into the terrorists' hands.

Still, as I have said before, none of us can close our eyes to the fact that we do face enemies who use their distorted version of Islam to justify slaughtering $ innocent people. They'd take us all back to the Stone Age if they could, just as they have in parts of Iraq and Syria.

The terrorist in Orlando targeted LGBT Americans out of hatred and bigotry. And an attack on any American is an attack on all Americans.

(APPLAUSE) And I want to say this to all the LGBT people grieving today in Florida and across our country. You have millions of allies who will always have your back.

(APPLAUSE)

And I am one of them.

(APPLAUSE)

From Stonewall to Laramie, and now Orlando, we've seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely, openly and without fear has been met by violence. We have to stand together, be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate.

Our open, diverse society is an asset in the struggle against terrorism, not a liability. It makes us stronger and more resistant to radicalization. And this raises a larger point about the future of our country.

America is strongest when we all believe that we have a stake in our country and our future.

CLINTON: This vision has sustained us from the beginning. The belief that, yes, we are all created equal and the journey we have made to turn that into reality over the course of our history, that we are not a land of winners and losers, that we should all have the opportunity to live up to our God-given potential. And we have a responsibility to help others do so as well.

(APPLAUSE)

As I look at American history, I see that this has always been a country of ""we"" not ""me."" We stand together because we are stronger together. E pluribus unum. One -- out of many, one -- has seen us through the darkest chapters of our history. Ever since 13 squabbling colonies put aside their disagreements and united because they realized they were going to rise together or fall separately, generation after generation has fought and marched and organized to widen the circle of dignity and opportunity. Ending slavery. Securing and expanding the right to vote. Throwing open the doors of education. Building the greatest middle class the world has ever seen.

And we are stronger when more people can participate in our democracy.

(APPLAUSE)

And we are stronger when everyone can share in the rewards of our economy and contribute to our communities, when we bridge our divides and lift each other up instead of tearing each other down. Now we have overcome a lot together and we will overcome the threats of terror and radicalization and all of our other challenges. Here in Ohio and across America, I've listened to people talk about the problems that keep you up at night.

The bonds that hold us together as communities, as one national community, are strained by an economy with too much inequality and too little upward mobility. By social and political divisions that have diminished our trust in each other and our confidence in our shared future. I have heard that, and I want you to know as your president I will work every day to break down all the barriers holding you back and keeping us apart. We're gonna get an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, we're gonna forge a new sense of connection and shared responsibility to each other and our nation.

And finally,

(APPLAUSE) finally let me remind us all, I remember, I remember how it felt, on the day after 9/11, and I bet many of you do as well. Americans from all walks of life rallied together with a sense of common purpose on September the 12th and in the days and weeks and months that followed. We had each others' backs. I was a senator from New York. There was a Republican president, a Republican governor, and a Republican mayor. We did not attack each other. We worked with each other to protect our country and to rebuild our city (ph).

(APPLAUSE)

President Bush went to a Muslim community center just six days after the attacks to send a message of unity and solidarity. To anyone who wanted to take out their anger on our Muslim neighbors and fellow citizens, he said, ""That should not, and that will not, stand in America."" It is time to get back to the spirit of those days, spirit of 9/12. Let's make sure we keep looking to the best of our country, to the best within each of us. Democratic and Republican presidents have risen to the occasion in the face of tragedy. That is what we are called to do my friends and I am so confident and optimistic that is exactly what we will do.

Thank you all so much."	0
66	"Breaking down barriers for African Americans Hillary Clinton ÃÂ· Follow Published in Hillary for America ÃÂ· 18 min read ÃÂ· Feb 17, 2016 -- 18 Listen Share

Thank you so much Charlie [Rangel]. Thanks for your friendship. Thanks for your leadership. The Congress will miss you when you leave its ranks, but I have a feeling that you are going to be spending a lot of time right here in Harlem. Charlie didnÃ¢ÂÂt tell you the whole story.

He was actually the person who called to encourage me to run for the Senate. He basically said that I had no choice. But it took me a long time before I realized he was right. HeÃ¢ÂÂs been a great friend and partner since then.

I want to tell you how special it is for me to be back here in Harlem to make this set of comments. I loved representing New York for eight years. And Harlem looms large in the American imagination, as the birthplace of so much art and culture and such vibrant public life. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs really no place like it in the world.

I appreciate being joined by the Governor [Cuomo] and Sandra, by the Mayor [De Blasio] and Chirlane, by the former Attorney General, Eric Holder, Representative Yvette Clark, and Representative Nydia VelÃÂ¡zquez, our Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, Public Advocate Letitia James. I want to thank Dr. Khalil Gibran Muhammad, and to all of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian caucus members and members of the New York City Council. The Black, Latino, and Asian Caucus: I thank you all so much for being here.

I want to pick up on what I just said about Harlem, because Harlem, and many other communities across America, remind us that any view of Black America that focuses exclusively on crime, poverty, or other challenges is missing so much. Missing the strength and the pride and the achievement that is evident on every street here.

That narrative is missing the remarkable rise of the African American middle class, the rise of African American Ã¢ÂÂ¦ leadership in all walks of life: in business, law, politics, science, the arts, sports, and all the professions. ItÃ¢ÂÂs missing the vibrancy of the black church, the passionate advocacy of the next generation of changemakers, and the service of leaders at every level, who never tire of making othersÃ¢ÂÂ lives better.

Earlier today, I spent some time with the heads of nine of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs historic civil rights groups, hosted by Marc Morial of the National Urban League. Reverend Al Sharpton attended. And we had a great conversation, because they are working to drive a 21st century agenda for jobs and freedom. I am grateful for their guidance and wisdom. I am also grateful to be speaking in this building that honors two men who represent just some of the diversity of the African American community.

Arturo Schomburg, who was from the Caribbean, and Langston Hughes, whose ashes are housed here, reminded all of us that when life ainÃ¢ÂÂt no crystal stair, youÃ¢ÂÂve got to keep climbing. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a good lesson for everyone.

But even as we acknowledge and even celebrate successes, itÃ¢ÂÂs important to remember: There are still very real barriers holding back African Americans from fully participating in our society. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what I am here to talk about today.

Last week on the debate stage in Milwaukee, I said I want to tear down all the barriers that hold back Americans across racial lines, because our country can only live up to its potential when every single American has the chance to live up to theirs. So I want to talk with you about how we break down the barriers that disproportionately affect African Americans and build ladders of opportunity in their place.

Last week, I went to Flint, Michigan. By now, we all know whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening there. Families, children, babies, drinking poisoned water for nearly two years because their government wanted to save a little money. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a horrifying story, but what makes it even worse is that itÃ¢ÂÂs not a coincidence that this was allowed to happen in a largely black, largely poor community. Just ask yourself, would this have ever occurred in a wealthy white suburb of Detroit? Absolutely not.

And as we have learned more about this crisis, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen other barriers holding back the people of Flint coming into clearer focus.

Years of under-investment have left behind a hollowed out community without enough jobs or opportunity for the people living there. Not enough families have access to the quality education that their children deserve. And they have too little political power, which left them vulnerable to a state government that ignored and dismissed their concerns.

Just imagine Ã¢ÂÂ every one of you a parent, a grandparent, an aunt, an uncle Ã¢ÂÂ going to the authorities holding a bottle of brown, smelly water. Telling those in authority, Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs something wrong with this water. My baby has a rash. I feel funny when I drink it or take a bath,Ã¢ÂÂ and being told, Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs nothing wrong with the water. Just go away.Ã¢ÂÂ

Flint is not alone. There are many Flints across our country: places where people of color and the poor have been left out and left behind.

Now, in the contest for the Democratic nomination, we have spent a lot of time debating about the big banks and the excesses of Wall Street, and these are important issues. And I am absolutely committed to ensuring that no bank is too big to fail, and no executive too powerful to jail.

But Flint reminds us thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot more going on in our country that we should be concerned about. The truth is we arenÃ¢ÂÂt a single-issue country. We face a complex set of economic, social, and political challenges.

They are intersectional, they are reinforcing, and we have got to take them all on.

So itÃ¢ÂÂs not enough for your economic plan to be, Ã¢ÂÂbreak up the banks.Ã¢ÂÂ You also need a serious plan to create jobs, especially in places where unemployment remains stubbornly high. You need a plan to address the generations of underinvestment and neglect.

Now even if we succeed on raising taxes on every millionaire and billionaire in America Ã¢ÂÂ and believe me, I do intend to succeed at that Ã¢ÂÂ we still need to face the painful reality that African Americans are nearly three times as likely as whites to be denied a mortgage. SomethingÃ¢ÂÂs wrong when the median wealth for black families is just a tiny fraction of the median wealth of white families.

And when gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined, there is something deeply wrong.

Something is wrong when African American men are far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men convicted of the same offenses. And when black kids get arrested for petty crimes, but white CEOÃ¢ÂÂs get away with fleecing our entire country, there is something wrong.

Just imagine with me, for a minute, if white kids were 500 percent more likely to die from asthma than black kids. Five hundred percent. Imagine if a white baby in South Carolina were twice as likely to die before her first birthday than an African American baby. Imagine the outcry. Imagine the resources that would flood in.

Now, these inequities are wrong Ã¢ÂÂ but theyÃ¢ÂÂre also immoral. And itÃ¢ÂÂll be the mission of my presidency to bring them to an end. We have to begin by facing up to the reality of systemic racism. Because these are not only problems of economic inequality.

These are problems of racial inequality. And we have got to say that loudly and clearly.

Now, I donÃ¢ÂÂt by any means intend to imply that we are not still making progress. We do have a lot to celebrate, as Congressman Rangel said. The people in this room know that Ã¢ÂÂ you have helped to make it happen.

And there is no better example of that progression than our president. And for all the partisan resistance President Obama has faced every day, remember Ã¢ÂÂ and celebrate Ã¢ÂÂ he brought our economy back from the brink of another Great Depression. On his watch, 14 million jobs have been created, health care has been brought to 18 million people, the auto industry was saved, and so much else.

Now, he would be the first to say Ã¢ÂÂ as weÃ¢ÂÂve heard him say Ã¢ÂÂ that despite our best efforts and our highest hopes, AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs long struggle with race is far from finished.

For many white Americans, itÃ¢ÂÂs tempting to believe that bigotry is largely behind us. That would leave us with a lot less work, wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt it? But more than half a century after Rosa Parks sat and Dr. King marched and John Lewis bled, race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind.

Now anyone Ã¢ÂÂ anyone Ã¢ÂÂ asking for your vote has a responsibility to grapple with this reality. To see things as they actually are, not just as we want them to be.

IÃ¢ÂÂd be the first to admit I donÃ¢ÂÂt have all the answers. IÃ¢ÂÂve made my own mistakes. IÃ¢ÂÂve walked my own journey. But I believe with all my heart we can and must do better. WeÃ¢ÂÂve made progress before, which gives me hope we can do it again. In the 1990s, economic programs like the new market tax credit, the earned income tax credit, and empowerment zones like the one right here in Harlem made a real difference in peopleÃ¢ÂÂs lives.

They helped to create the highest increase in black incomes and the lowest black unemployment in history. We achieved record small-business lending to minority-owned businesses, and record bank lending in minority communities. Right here in Harlem, the unemployment rate dropped by two-thirds, and we saw a drop in child poverty and an increase in employment and income for single mothers, too.

We also learned about what doesnÃ¢ÂÂt work. Some of what we tried didnÃ¢ÂÂt resolve problems. Some ended up creating new ones, and caused disappointment, frustration, even anger. So as we face todayÃ¢ÂÂs challenges, we have to bring all those lessons to bear.

HereÃ¢ÂÂs the bottom line, as I see it: When we make direct strategic investments in communities that have been left behind, and when we guarantee justice and dignity to every American, then we really can make progress. Lasting progress. Progress that will catapult us into the future. We can reduce poverty. We can build ladders of opportunity.

So IÃ¢ÂÂm proposing a comprehensive new commitment to equity and opportunity for African American communities. That means a real plan to create jobs. If IÃ¢ÂÂm elected president, we will direct hundreds of billions of dollars in new investments to places like Harlem and rural South Carolina Ã¢ÂÂ including $20 billion aimed specifically at creating jobs for young people.

The unemployment rate among young African Americans is twice as high as for young white people. Now, we need to get young people working, developing their skills, unlocking the full extent of the contributions they can make to themselves, their families, and our country. We need to make sure weÃ¢ÂÂre not only creating good jobs, but connecting black communities to where the good jobs are.

So weÃ¢ÂÂve got to be strategic about our investments in transit and infrastructure. And we need a real plan, including expanding access to capital to support black entrepreneurs Ã¢ÂÂ especially black women, who represent the fastest-growing segment of women-owned businesses in America. And while weÃ¢ÂÂre at it, letÃ¢ÂÂs finally ensure equal pay for equal work for women.

That would benefit women of color most of all, and would lift up an awful lot of families. And letÃ¢ÂÂs go even further. LetÃ¢ÂÂs follow Governor CuomoÃ¢ÂÂs lead and raise the minimum wage to help people get out of poverty.

Now we need to support African American homeownership, which has always been one of the surest ways for black families to build wealth. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why I have a plan that would, among things, help African American families save for a down payment.

We need to make sure every family also has access to quality pre-school. And I applaud Mayor De Blasio for what heÃ¢ÂÂs achieved here in New York with his pre-K program.

And please, help us reverse the dangerous slide towards re-segregation in our schools. Our schools are now more segregated than they were in 1968. That is appalling, and weÃ¢ÂÂve got to fix it.

We also have to make sure everyone who wants to go to college can afford to. And everyone with student debt can have that debt refinanced, and take thousands of dollars off the burden that they are carrying!

LetÃ¢ÂÂs give tax credits to businesses that actually invest in training and in apprenticeship programs to help young people who donÃ¢ÂÂt go for a two or four-year degree.

And my plan gives special support to historically black colleges and universities.

The HBCUs have produced some of the finest leaders in our country. And itÃ¢ÂÂs not just who they graduated in the past, itÃ¢ÂÂs the work theyÃ¢ÂÂre still doing today Ã¢ÂÂ often against great odds.

And then finally, and so importantly, we need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system.

Not half measures, but a full commitment with real follow-through. Now, this is something we can talk about for hours. In fact, I gave my first speech of this campaign in April not far from here, and it was about reforming criminal justice. Because the inequities that persist in our justice system undermine our shared vision of what America can Ã¢ÂÂ and should Ã¢ÂÂ be.

Our legal system is still, all too often, stacked against those who have the least power, who are the most vulnerable. And weÃ¢ÂÂve seen the toll it takes on families torn apart by excessive incarceration, and children growing up in homes shattered by prison and poverty.

WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to get back to that fundamental principle that everyone, in every community, benefits when there is respect for the law Ã¢ÂÂ and when everyone is respected by the law. That is the formula for building trust and cooperation, and we need to not only acknowledge but fix the crisis of mass incarceration.

LetÃ¢ÂÂs finally, once and for all, eliminate the remaining disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine. LetÃ¢ÂÂs rebuild the bonds of trust between law enforcement and communities by creating more opportunities for people to actually interact with one another, to build relationships.

LetÃ¢ÂÂs the end the epidemic of African Americans being killed by police or dying in custody.

Now I think you know Ã¢ÂÂ because I sure believe Ã¢ÂÂ there are many police officers out there every day inspiring trust and confidence, putting themselves on the line to save lives. So letÃ¢ÂÂs learn from those who are doing it right, and apply those lessons across the country.

LetÃ¢ÂÂs make sure the Justice Department has the resources to hold departments Ã¢ÂÂ like FergusonÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ accountable when they do it wrong.

Again and again, something terrible happens Ã¢ÂÂ and no one is held accountable; the deeply troubling pattern, and weÃ¢ÂÂve got to break it. WeÃ¢ÂÂve also got to do a much better job of helping people who have paid their debt to society find jobs and support when they get out.

Up to 60 percent of prisoners who re-enter society face long-term unemployment. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a recipe for hopelessness and repeat offending. My jobs plan would make significant investments in re-entry programs for the formerly incarcerated.

In my faith, we believe in second chances. In America, we believe in second chances. LetÃ¢ÂÂs give those chances to people who need our help the most. LetÃ¢ÂÂs give them a fair shot Ã¢ÂÂ which is also why I will Ã¢ÂÂban the boxÃ¢ÂÂ in the federal government. And I want to thank Attorney General Holder, who has been really in the forefront of making so many of these changes happen. And I also want to thank another great New Yorker, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who is continuing the work for equity and justice!

And letÃ¢ÂÂs roll up our sleeves and get to work to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline. ItÃ¢ÂÂs diverting too many African-American kids into the criminal justice system, instead of giving them the education they deserve.

WeÃ¢ÂÂve seen a significant increase in police involvement in school discipline, especially in schools with majority-black students. WeÃ¢ÂÂre seeing an over-reliance on suspensions and expulsions. IÃ¢ÂÂm sure many of us remember that horrifying video of the girl in South Carolina being thrown out of her desk and dragged across her classroom by a school police officer.

A classroom should be a safe place for our children. We shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt even have to say that, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think.

So today IÃ¢ÂÂm announcing my plan to end the school to prison pipeline. It includes major investments in school districts that reform their discipline practices. We want districts to know, if they do the right thing, weÃ¢ÂÂll have their backs. And we will dramatically expand support for guidance counselors, school psychologists and social workers Ã¢ÂÂ so instead of just labeling kids problem students, they can actually help kids with their problems, and keep them in school!

And for schools that refuse to reform and states that refuse to take this issue seriously, I want the Department of EducationÃ¢ÂÂs Office of Civil Rights to intervene, because this Ã¢ÂÂ this is not just an education issue, this is a civil rights issue and we cannot ignore it any longer.

The bottom line is this: We need to be sending our kids to college. We need a cradle-to-college pipeline, not sending them into court and into prison.

ThereÃ¢ÂÂs much more to do. If you go to my website, hillaryclinton.com, you can read our full agenda.

Sometimes people make fun of me because I actually tell you what I want to do as president. I actually give you plans about what I want to do. I kind of think itÃ¢ÂÂs my duty to help inform voters, so that you can make a good decision!

But I want to mention one more critical area: Protecting that most fundamental of rights Ã¢ÂÂ the right to vote. Across our country, Republican governors and legislatures are erecting one barrier after another that make it harder for black people to vote. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a blast from the Jim Crow past, and we need to call it for what it is.

And in the past few days the stakes got even higher. Justice ScaliaÃ¢ÂÂs passing means the court hangs in the balance. Now the Republicans say theyÃ¢ÂÂll reject anyone President Obama nominates, no matter how qualified. Some are even saying he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have the right to nominate anyone, as if somehow heÃ¢ÂÂs not the real president.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs in keeping with what weÃ¢ÂÂve heard all along, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it? Many Republicans talk in coded, racial language about takers and losers. They demonize President Obama and encourage the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe. This kind of hatred and bigotry has no place in our politics Ã¢ÂÂ or our country.

The president has the right to nominate, under the Constitution, and the Senate has the obligation to process that nomination. And I hope the Senate will start paying more attention to statesmanship than partisanship. And I hope that they will understand that we can have our differences, but letÃ¢ÂÂs not go right after fundamental rules of how we govern ourselves. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a bridge way too far, my friends.

Now, I will appoint Supreme Court justices who will see the Constitution as a blueprint for progress, not as an excuse to try to roll back decisions going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt Ã¢ÂÂ which is apparently what some of them would prefer to do!

Now I suppose some people will hear what IÃ¢ÂÂm proposing and think, Ã¢ÂÂWell, sheÃ¢ÂÂs saying this because sheÃ¢ÂÂs in an election.Ã¢ÂÂ But many of you in this audience know me, and you know that these issues have always been part of my North Star.

In my first semester at law school, a woman named Marian Wright Edelman came to speak on campus at Yale. She was the first African American woman admitted to the Mississippi bar, a lawyer for the NAACP in Jackson, a friend of Dr. King before he was murdered Ã¢ÂÂ altogether a remarkable person. She talked about starting a Head Start program in Mississippi and using her legal education on behalf of poor children who were invisible to the rest of the country.

Something clicked in my brain that day. Until I heard Marian speak, it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt clear to me how to channel my faith and commitment to social justice to try to make a real difference in the world. But she put me on the path of service.

I went to work for her at the ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Defense Fund. She sent me to her home state of South Carolina to take on the problem of black teenagers who were being incarcerated along with adults. And when I look back, everything else IÃ¢ÂÂve done Ã¢ÂÂ whether it was going undercover to Alabama to expose segregated academies and try to skip them of their tax exemptions, or running a legal clinic at the University of Arkansas, to represent inmates Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs been part of my mission. Representing poor people through the Legal Services Corporation: ItÃ¢ÂÂs about making peopleÃ¢ÂÂs lives better.

And it taught me that, even if youÃ¢ÂÂre young and you donÃ¢ÂÂt have a powerful job, if you work at it and you stick with it, you can make a difference.

Ã¢ÂÂ¦ You know, to quote Dr. King, the time is always right to do right Ã¢ÂÂ no matter who you are. And when I had the great privilege of representing New York, I worked with members of our congressional delegation. We fought to bring investments and jobs to neighborhoods that needed them, to improve health care, to get cleaner air and water for low-income communities.

One of the highlights was partnering with the organization, One Hundred Black Men, to create the Eagle Academy, which has been so successful Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs grown to six schools now in New York Ã¢ÂÂ taking young African American and Latino men.

There was always something to be done, and I had so many partners here in New York. We championed reforms to probation and drug diversion programs. We promoted specialized drug courts and juvenile programs, coming full circle with the work that I had done for Marion.

So when I decided to run for president, I knew these issues had to be at the heart of my campaign. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs where theyÃ¢ÂÂve always been, thatÃ¢ÂÂs where they will always be.

And I want to add something else: We Democrats have a special obligation: If weÃ¢ÂÂre serious about our commitment to the poor, to those who need some help, including African Americans, if we continue to ask black people to vote for us, we cannot minimize the realities of the lives they lead or take their concerns for granted.

You know, you canÃ¢ÂÂt just show up at election time and say the right things and think thatÃ¢ÂÂs enough. We canÃ¢ÂÂt start building relationships a few weeks before a vote. We have to demonstrate a sustained commitment to building opportunity, creating prosperity, and righting wrongs. Not just every two or four years, not just when the cameras are on and people are watching, but every single day.

So hereÃ¢ÂÂs what I ask of you: Hold me accountable. Hold every candidate accountable. What we say matters Ã¢ÂÂ but what we do matters more. And you deserve leaders who will do whatever it takes to tear down all the barriers holding you back, and then replace them with those ladders of opportunities that every American deserves to have.

IÃ¢ÂÂm also asking all Americans to join in that effort. As Cornell Brooks, the new head of the NAACP, said in our meeting this morning: None of this is a Ã¢ÂÂtheyÃ¢ÂÂ problem. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a Ã¢ÂÂweÃ¢ÂÂ problem, and all of us have to admit that. And you know what? It is not an urban problem. ItÃ¢ÂÂs an American problem.

Ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of us Ã¢ÂÂ especially those of us who havenÃ¢ÂÂt experienced it ourselves. White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day.

We need to recognize our privilege and practice humility, rather than assume that our experiences are everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs experiences. All of us need to bring our skills to bare Ã¢ÂÂ and especially young people coming up today, who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems.

And we all need to try as best we can to walk in one anotherÃ¢ÂÂs shoes. Imagine what it would be like to sit our son or daughter down and have the talk. Or if people followed us around stores or locked our car doors whenever we walked past.

That kind of empathy is critical. ItÃ¢ÂÂs what makes it possible for people from every background, every race, every religion to come together in this great city, and to come together as one nation. ItÃ¢ÂÂs what makes a country like America endure.

You know, I started my remarks by talking about Flint. IÃ¢ÂÂm going to keep talking about Flint until the families there get the help they need Ã¢ÂÂ for as long as it takes.

But thereÃ¢ÂÂs another side to the story of this tragedy.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs the story of hundreds of union plumbers from across the country travelling to Flint to install water filters for free.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs students at universities all over the Midwest raising funds for water deliveries and student athletes showing up in Flint to distribute supplies.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs the United Auto Workers and General Motors donating millions.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs money pouring in to organizations where people are donating, if you wish, to try and help the kids and the people of Flint. And IÃ¢ÂÂm grateful to everyone who has responded to our request sent out to our campaign.

And itÃ¢ÂÂs the story of that kindergartner in Wilton, NH who lost his first tooth just a few days ago. The tooth fairy left him five dollars. I got a dime, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know about you.

And he said to his mother, Ã¢ÂÂI want to give it so those little kids can have water.Ã¢ÂÂ His mom sat right down and wrote me a letter about it.

To me, thatÃ¢ÂÂs the best of America, and it keeps me going. That sense we are all in this together. We all have vital contributions to make, and that when we come together Ã¢ÂÂ all of us Ã¢ÂÂ with a sense of shared purpose and shared humanity, we can solve any problem we face.

And we can heal any divide. We can build a future that is far, far better than our past. That is my hope for our country, that is my goal for this election, and I promise to keep fighting right alongside all of you, every day, to make the United States a place where all men and all women are treated as equals Ã¢ÂÂ just as we are, just as we deserve to be.

That is my hope for America.

Thank you all very much."	0

68	"The Bodybuilding community has long coveted the best performance-enhancing drug to boost muscle growth and improve energy levels. For starters, you have dbols, one of the most popular steroids today. It has also been said that this steroid can be found in muscle cells in as little as 6 hours after injection. Bodybuilders use this drug because it has an anabolic effect on muscle proteins. It speeds up protein synthesis and cures some minor health issues.

This muscle catalyst is also known to promote the growth of new muscle tissue. However, its effects can last up to two weeks, making it a popular choice among bodybuilders. This steroid has also been shown to improve nitrogen balance and enhance recovery from training. It also provides an increase in lean body mass as well as bone density. Here is the list of the best performance-enhancing drugs for bodybuilding:

Anabolic Drugs Or Steroids

Anabolic drugs or steroids are involved in building and maintaining muscles. The steroid substances that promote muscle tissue growth are, in fact, precursors to basic hormones. The pituitary gland produces anabolic hormones. It is controlled by a hormone gland located at the base of the brain.

These hormones control several functions such as; metabolism and protein synthesis. When you take this steroid, it will help you to gain muscle, strength, and stamina. This dbols supplement also plays an important role in building muscle and bones through stimulating protein.

Beta-2 Agonists

These synthetic drugs help expand the lungsÃ¢ÂÂ capacity, which means more oxygen is forced into your bloodstream. This, in turn, will increase metabolism rates and build lean muscles. These drugs are used during training sessions and events where a bodybuilder will be working out. The Beta-2 Agonists allow the body to burn more carbohydrates, and at the same time, they help you to use fat as energy. It also provides great energy that helps to reduce fatigue, stress, and anxiety.

Human Growth Hormone

Also referred to as HGH, this drug has increased lean muscles. Human Growth Hormone is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland responsible for growth during childhood. It remains active the whole life and can be stimulated by taking HGH. In addition, testosterone and other human growth hormone are factors that lead to building muscle. Athletes who take this drug have an increase in insulin which is also an indirect anabolic effect of HGH.

Ephedrine

Bodybuilders have used ephedrine for a long time. It has been around there for so long because of its ability to burn fat, boost metabolism, and enhance physical performance. Ephedrine is a popular drug for bodybuilders because it can be helpful while training and events to burn fat and increase muscles.

Methenolone

Methenolone is another popular steroid that is considered to be milder than most. Athletes use it for its potency in enhancing recovery time and prevention of injury. This steroid has also been used to increase muscle size and strength. It has the specialty of recovering the injury, whether external or internal. That is why athletes and sports people mostly consume it."	1

The following is a transcript of Wednesday nightÃ¢ÂÂs presidential debate in Denver.

21:01:40: JIM LEHRER: Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. IÃ¢ÂÂm Jim Lehrer of the Ã¢ÂÂPBS NewsHour,Ã¢ÂÂ and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 presidential debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.

This debate and the next three Ã¢ÂÂ two presidential, one vice presidential Ã¢ÂÂ are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. TonightÃ¢ÂÂs 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment.

Thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates.

The segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements.

The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent Ã¢ÂÂ no cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney.

(APPLAUSE)

Gentlemen, welcome to you both. LetÃ¢ÂÂs start the economy, segment one, and letÃ¢ÂÂs begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?

You have two minutes. Each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.

21:04:24: PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.

There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.

And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.

(LAUGHTER)

You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up.

And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, weÃ¢ÂÂve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise.

But we all know that weÃ¢ÂÂve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where weÃ¢ÂÂve been, but where weÃ¢ÂÂre going.

Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that weÃ¢ÂÂll be better off. IÃ¢ÂÂve got a different view.

I think weÃ¢ÂÂve got to invest in education and training. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that weÃ¢ÂÂre helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that weÃ¢ÂÂre saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.

Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters Ã¢ÂÂ to you Ã¢ÂÂ which path we should take. Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And IÃ¢ÂÂm looking forward to having that debate.

21: 06:31: LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.

21:06:32: FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. ItÃ¢ÂÂs an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president. IÃ¢ÂÂm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.

And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. IÃ¢ÂÂm sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here Ã¢ÂÂ here with me. So IÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(LAUGHTER)

Congratulations.

This is obviously a very tender topic. IÃ¢ÂÂve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve been out of work since May. Can you help me?Ã¢ÂÂ

Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, Ã¢ÂÂAnn, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. HeÃ¢ÂÂs lost his most recent job and weÃ¢ÂÂve now just lost our home. Can you help us?Ã¢ÂÂ

And the answer is, yes, we can help, but itÃ¢ÂÂs going to take a different path. Not the one weÃ¢ÂÂve been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not what IÃ¢ÂÂm going to do.

My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs.

Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.

Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. WeÃ¢ÂÂre far away from that now.

Number four, get to us a balanced budget.

Number five, champion small business. ItÃ¢ÂÂs small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.

Now, IÃ¢ÂÂm concerned that the path that weÃ¢ÂÂre on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more Ã¢ÂÂ if you will, trickle-down government Ã¢ÂÂ would work.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not the right answer for America. IÃ¢ÂÂll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.

21:08:40: LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down Ã¢ÂÂ his trick-down approach, as he said yours is.

21:08:50: OBAMA: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, weÃ¢ÂÂve got to improve our education system and weÃ¢ÂÂve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.

So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.

When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.

On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that weÃ¢ÂÂve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than theyÃ¢ÂÂve been in years. But I also believe that weÃ¢ÂÂve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.

So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things IÃ¢ÂÂm sure weÃ¢ÂÂll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?

And this is where thereÃ¢ÂÂs a difference, because Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut Ã¢ÂÂ on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs another trillion dollars Ã¢ÂÂ and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasnÃ¢ÂÂt asked for. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.

21:11:03: LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can.

But, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that youÃ¢ÂÂd like to ask the president directly about something he just said?

21:11:03: ROMNEY: Well, sure. IÃ¢ÂÂd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.

First of all, I donÃ¢ÂÂt have a $5 trillion tax cut. I donÃ¢ÂÂt have a tax cut of a scale that youÃ¢ÂÂre talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. TheyÃ¢ÂÂll do fine whether youÃ¢ÂÂre president or I am.

The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a Ã¢ÂÂ this is a tax in and of itself. IÃ¢ÂÂll call it the economy tax. ItÃ¢ÂÂs been crushing.

At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed.

And so the question is how to get them going again. And IÃ¢ÂÂve described it. ItÃ¢ÂÂs energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the Ã¢ÂÂ the cornerstones of my plan.

But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas IÃ¢ÂÂll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, weÃ¢ÂÂve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.

The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.

The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies.

Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If IÃ¢ÂÂm president, IÃ¢ÂÂll double them, and also get the Ã¢ÂÂ the oil from offshore and Alaska. And IÃ¢ÂÂll bring that pipeline in from Canada.

And, by the way, I like coal. IÃ¢ÂÂm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like itÃ¢ÂÂs getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.

And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, IÃ¢ÂÂm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the Ã¢ÂÂ the revenues going to the government. My Ã¢ÂÂ my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.

But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I Ã¢ÂÂ and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any Ã¢ÂÂ any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?

21:14:22: OBAMA: Well, I think Ã¢ÂÂ letÃ¢ÂÂs talk about taxes, because I think itÃ¢ÂÂs instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.

And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid whoÃ¢ÂÂs going off to college, which means theyÃ¢ÂÂre spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.

Now, Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that heÃ¢ÂÂs been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been able to identify them.

But IÃ¢ÂÂm going to make an important point here, Jim.

21:16:34: LEHRER: All right.

21:16:36: OBAMA: When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can Ã¢ÂÂ are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you donÃ¢ÂÂt come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.

OBAMA: And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs pledge of not reducing the deficit or Ã¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂ or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families. The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.

Now, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not my analysis. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And Ã¢ÂÂ and that kind of top Ã¢ÂÂ top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.

21:16:37: LEHRER: All right. What is the difference? LetÃ¢ÂÂs just stay on taxes.

(CROSSTALK)

LEHRER: Just Ã¢ÂÂ letÃ¢ÂÂs just stay on taxes for (inaudible).

(CROSSTALK)

LEHRER: What is the differenceÃ¢ÂÂ¦

21:16:42: ROMNEY: Well, but Ã¢ÂÂ but virtually Ã¢ÂÂ virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.

21:16:43: LEHRER: All right.

21:16:44: ROMNEY: So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, IÃ¢ÂÂd say absolutely not. IÃ¢ÂÂm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What IÃ¢ÂÂve said is I wonÃ¢ÂÂt put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs part one. So thereÃ¢ÂÂs no economist that can say Mitt RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.

Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know itÃ¢ÂÂs a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but itÃ¢ÂÂs just not the case. Look, IÃ¢ÂÂve got five boys. IÃ¢ÂÂm used to people saying something thatÃ¢ÂÂs not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping IÃ¢ÂÂll believe it. But that Ã¢ÂÂ that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.

And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say itÃ¢ÂÂs completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said youÃ¢ÂÂre going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.

There are all these studies out there. But letÃ¢ÂÂs get at the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And youÃ¢ÂÂd think, well, then why lower the rates.

And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people.

(CROSSTALK)

21:18:30: LEHRER: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs where we started. Yeah.

Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?

21:18:34: OBAMA: Well, for 18 months heÃ¢ÂÂs been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, heÃ¢ÂÂs saying that his big, bold idea is, Ã¢ÂÂNever mind.Ã¢ÂÂ

And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. ItÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs math. ItÃ¢ÂÂs arithmetic.

Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates Ã¢ÂÂ the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.

But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.

And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but weÃ¢ÂÂre also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.

And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under Ã¢ÂÂ under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, theyÃ¢ÂÂre the job creators, theyÃ¢ÂÂd be burdened.

But under Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesnÃ¢ÂÂt like to think of himself as small anything, but Ã¢ÂÂ but thatÃ¢ÂÂs how you define small businesses if youÃ¢ÂÂre getting business income.

And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.

21:21:01: LEHRER: All right.

21:21:03: ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on that Ã¢ÂÂ on that point, which is theseÃ¢ÂÂ¦

21:21:04: LEHRER: Just for the Ã¢ÂÂ just for recordÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

21:21:07: ROMNEY: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ the small businesses weÃ¢ÂÂre talking aboutÃ¢ÂÂ¦

21:21:09: LEHRER: Excuse me. Excuse me. Just so everybody understands, weÃ¢ÂÂre way over our first 15 minutes.

21:21:10: ROMNEY: ItÃ¢ÂÂs fun, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it?

21:21:11: LEHRER: ItÃ¢ÂÂs OK, itÃ¢ÂÂs great. No problem. Well, you all donÃ¢ÂÂt have Ã¢ÂÂ you donÃ¢ÂÂt have a problem, I donÃ¢ÂÂt have a problem, because weÃ¢ÂÂre still on the economy. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to come back to taxes. I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too.

OK, but go ahead, sir.

21:21:38: ROMNEY: You bet. Well, President, youÃ¢ÂÂre Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. President, youÃ¢ÂÂre absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not Ã¢ÂÂ not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, theyÃ¢ÂÂre taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half Ã¢ÂÂ half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.

Now, and Ã¢ÂÂ and IÃ¢ÂÂve talked to a guy who has a very small business. HeÃ¢ÂÂs in the electronics business in Ã¢ÂÂ in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.

I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because thereÃ¢ÂÂs nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.

21:22:58: OBAMA: Jim, I Ã¢ÂÂ you may want to move onto another topic, but I Ã¢ÂÂ I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion Ã¢ÂÂ just to give you a sense, over 10 years, thatÃ¢ÂÂs more than our entire defense budget Ã¢ÂÂ and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs plan may work for you.

But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us thatÃ¢ÂÂs not a recipe for job growth. Look, weÃ¢ÂÂve tried this. WeÃ¢ÂÂve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

Bill Clinton tried the approach that IÃ¢ÂÂm talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways, weÃ¢ÂÂve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that theyÃ¢ÂÂve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure weÃ¢ÂÂre not blowing up the deficit.

21:24:40: ROMNEY: Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.

(CROSSTALK)

21:24:42: LEHRER: Well, youÃ¢ÂÂre going to get the first word in the next segment.

21:24:48: ROMNEY: All right. Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word (inaudible) I hope. Let me just make this comment.

(CROSSTALK)

21:24:50: ROMNEY: I think first of all, let me Ã¢ÂÂ let me repeat Ã¢ÂÂ let me repeat what I said. IÃ¢ÂÂm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs point one.

So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but thatÃ¢ÂÂs not my plan.

Number two, letÃ¢ÂÂs look at history. My plan is not like anything thatÃ¢ÂÂs been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.

My priority is putting people back to work in America. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. ItÃ¢ÂÂs absolutely extraordinary. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. ItÃ¢ÂÂs just Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂve got Ã¢ÂÂ when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.

Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.

21:26:01: LEHRER: All right. LetÃ¢ÂÂs talk Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂre still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt.

And the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you Ã¢ÂÂ you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?

21:26:31: ROMNEY: Good. IÃ¢ÂÂm glad you raised that, and itÃ¢ÂÂs a Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs a critical issue. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs not just an economic issue, I think itÃ¢ÂÂs a moral issue. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.

And the amount of debt weÃ¢ÂÂre adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.

So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, theyÃ¢ÂÂre paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.

The presidents would Ã¢ÂÂ president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.

What things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they donÃ¢ÂÂt pass it: Is the program so critical itÃ¢ÂÂs worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, IÃ¢ÂÂll get rid of it. ObamacareÃ¢ÂÂs on my list.

I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way.

OBAMA: I like it.

ROMNEY: Good. OK, good. So IÃ¢ÂÂll get rid of that.

IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry, Jim, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to stop the subsidy to PBS. IÃ¢ÂÂm going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs number one.

Number two, IÃ¢ÂÂll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.

Number three, IÃ¢ÂÂll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.

This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.

The president said heÃ¢ÂÂd cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The presidentÃ¢ÂÂs put it in place as much public debt Ã¢ÂÂ almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.

21:28:35: LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes.

21:28:37: OBAMA: When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.

And despite that, what weÃ¢ÂÂve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didnÃ¢ÂÂt slip into a Great Depression, but what weÃ¢ÂÂve also said is, letÃ¢ÂÂs make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.

So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but werenÃ¢ÂÂt working very well, 18 government Ã¢ÂÂ 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not werenÃ¢ÂÂt helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.

And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.

Now, we all know that weÃ¢ÂÂve got to do more. And so IÃ¢ÂÂve put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. ItÃ¢ÂÂs on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.

And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, thatÃ¢ÂÂs how the commission Ã¢ÂÂ bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.

Let Ã¢ÂÂ let me just finish their point, because youÃ¢ÂÂre looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no.

Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

21:31:15: OBAMA: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.

21:31:22: LEHRER: Mr. President, IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry.

21:31:26: OBAMA: And Ã¢ÂÂ and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.

21:31:28: LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.

21:31:28: OBAMA: Sorry.

21:31:34: LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles? Do you support Simpson-Bowles?

21:31:34: ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.

21:31:35: LEHRER: No, I mean, do you support Simpson-Bowles?

21:31:36: ROMNEY: I have my own plan. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not the same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the president should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.

21:31:48: OBAMA: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what weÃ¢ÂÂve done, made some adjustments to it, and weÃ¢ÂÂre putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion planÃ¢ÂÂ¦

ROMNEY: But youÃ¢ÂÂve been Ã¢ÂÂ but youÃ¢ÂÂve been president four yearsÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

21:31:54: ROMNEY: YouÃ¢ÂÂve been president four years. You said youÃ¢ÂÂd cut the deficit in half. ItÃ¢ÂÂs now four years later. We still have trillion-doll"	0

State of the Union

Interview With Congressmen Larson, Pence; Interview With Senators Hatch, Feinstein

Aired March 21, 2010 - 09:00 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



CROWLEY: Normally, on Sundays, we take a reflective look at the past week and set the agenda for the coming days, but today is no normal Sunday. We are four hours away from a showdown in the House of Representatives, a series of votes that will determine the future of health care reform, impact the economy, influence this November's election and set the stage for the rest of President Obama's agenda. Today is no normal Sunday. Today is game day. I am Candy Crowley and this is State of the Union.



This morning, health reform from all angles. Two House leaders, John Larson and Mike Pence, on today's vote. Two senior senators, Dianne Feinstein, and Orrin Hatch, on the week ahead. And analysis from Donna Brazile and Bill Bennett.



We have heard the words ""end game"" so many times in this health care debate, I wouldn't try it now. That said, it would in fact be the end if Republicans prevailed in today's vote. For Democrats, the magic number is 216. That's how many yeas needed to pass the health care bill in the House, 216 votes among the 253 Democratic members. It has been a struggle all week to get there. We begin with seven days in two minutes.



(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)



DAVID AXELROD, SR. ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT: I think we will have the votes.



REP. JOHN A. BOEHNER, R-OHIO: If she had 216 votes, this bill would be long gone.



PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Hello, Ohio!



REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: When we bring the bill to the floor, we will have the votes.



REP. JAMES E. CLYBURN, D-S.C., MAJORITY WHIP: We need to get to 216. And we are still tweaking stuff.



OBAMA: Your own congressman, who is tireless on behalf of the working people, Dennis Kucinich.



ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It is an important trip that the president will take. And I think he looks forward to it. REP. ERIC CANTOR, R-VA.: I mean, it is clear. They don't have the votes, because the American people can't stand this bill.



REP. DENNIS J. KUCINICH, D-OHIO: I've decided to cast a vote in favor of the legislation.



GIBBS: That he must postpone his planned visits for a later date.



REP. BART STUPAK, D-MICH.: As of today, I am still voting no. Yes, I am still standing with this principle, protecting the sanctity of life. Yes.



OBAMA: Hello, George Mason!



(UNKNOWN): Yes. I will be voting yes for the bill.



PELOSI: Right now, we are just getting votes to pass a bill.



OBAMA: And in just a few days, a century-long struggle will culminate in a historic vote.



BOEHNER: We are about 24 hours from Armageddon.



CROWD: Kill the bill, kill the bill, kill the bill!



REP. ANH ""JOSEPH"" CAO, R-LA.: Tomorrow will be a sad day for me as I cast a no vote against something I believe we need.



(UNKNOWN): I will be a proud supporter of health care reform.



REP. STENY H. HOYER, D-MD., MAJORITY LEADER: Clearly, we believe we have the vote.



(UNKNOWN): We feel like we have been pregnant for 17 months. Let's get on with it already.



OBAMA: We have been debating health care for decades. It has now been debated for a year. It is in your hands.



(END VIDEOTAPE)



CROWLEY: Here to look ahead to today's vote and the high stakes politics surrounding it, House Democratic Caucus Chairman, John Larson of Connecticut, and the House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence of Indiana. Gentlemen, thank you both for joining me.



PENCE: Thank you, Candy.



LARSON: Great to be with you, Candy.



CROWLEY: State of play, where are you? 216, do you have it locked in?



LARSON: This is a historic day. And we are happy warriors. We are so proud of the Democratic caucus, that we will be a part of history, joining Franklin Delano Roosevelt's passage of Social Security, Lyndon Johnson's passage of Medicare, and now Barack Obama's passage of health care reform.



CROWLEY: So you have got the 216?



LARSON: We've got the votes. And the reason for that, Candy, I think it started earlier this week with Natoma Canfield becoming the poster child for -- or lady for health care reform. And that struck such a cord within our caucus. And Dennis Moore standing up to give a speech in the caucus was Blackberried by a woman who works with him in Kansas. She said thank you for voting for this. I know I am losing my job at the end of this year, and unfortunately, I have just been diagnosed with cancer. Without this bill, I'm lost. Dennis ended by saying, and she is 24. You could have heard a pin drop.



This is about whose side you are on. And clearly, this historic moment in the people's chamber, we are on the side of the American people and those that have been denied access to health care, and those who have pre-existing conditions who have been denied, and those who have had their policies rescinded.



CROWLEY: Congressman Pence, I think that puts you on the side not of the people, if we take his calculation. What is left for Republicans to do? Congressman Larson says they have the 216. So it is all over but the shouting? You guys vote no and move on?



PENCE: Well, I don't know if they have the votes. House Republicans are going to use every means at our disposal.



CROWLEY: What is that?



PENCE: Well, stay tuned, Candy. It's going to be an interesting day.



CROWLEY: Can you disrupt the vote? I mean, what's available?



PENCE: We are going to use every means at our disposal to oppose this government takeover of health care. Because quite frankly, as thousands gather at rallies all across this country and here in the nation's capital, yesterday, you know, the American people are sick and tired of runaway federal spending by both parties, of borrowing and bailouts and takeovers. And I believe this is going to be a historic weekend.



LARSON: It is.



PENCE: But I think it is going to be different from the way John thinks it is going to be. I think this is going to be a historic weekend because I think this weekend is going to be the beginning of the end of business as usual in Washington, D.C. I think the American people see an administration and see a Congress that are in a headlong rush to confront the very real challenges that we have in health care with more government instead of more freedom.



They know -- the Republicans have been offering solutions from the beginning. Let people purchase health insurance across state lines, pass malpractice reform, cover preexisting conditions. All of that can be done without a massive, trillion-dollar expansion of the federal government and burdening future generations with more deficits and more debt.



CROWLEY: But the reality of this day is that you don't have the votes to stop it. You may have the means to delay it. PENCE: Right. You know, the Republicans, it shouldn't be a news flash to anybody, Republicans don't have the votes to stop anything in the House of Representatives. We are in a decisive minority.



CROWLEY: (inaudible) politically.



PENCE: But what's remarkable about this one-year debate has proven my point, that a minority in Congress plus the American people equals a majority. Republicans -- the reason they weren't able to do this last year -- remember all the deadlines? We had deadlines in the summer, we had deadlines in the fall, we had deadlines at the end of the year. The American people don't want this government takeover of health care. And I don't know if they have the votes today, but I guarantee you, the American people know they have the votes in America.



LARSON: The American people who are already on Medicare, all of our veterans who already receive Tricare, understand the importance and the value of having insurance coverage. For 47 million Americans who have none, 31 million will now be able to have access to insurance, lowering costs, lowering costs for small businesses, lowering the national debt. First, $138 billion, and then $1.2 trillion. We can't afford not to do this. And taking care of those people--



(CROSSTALK)



CROWLEY: I want to talk about the debt. Hang on one second. I have got to take a small break--



(CROSSTALK)



CROWLEY: We will come back. I do want to talk about the costs. There are some figures out there floating. I'll do that, we'll be back with Congressmen Larson and Pence right after this.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CROWLEY: We are back with Democratic Congressman John Larson of Connecticut and Republican Congressman Mike Pence of Indiana. We were talking about the cost of this. The CBO has said over 10 years this health care bill will reduce the deficit by $143 billion.



However, that doesn't include what might come and what has been promised, with more than a wink and a nod to doctors, which is to up their Medicare payments, their reimbursements, which would cost $208 million, which then means it actually would be -- would add to the deficit.



Is that -- is my math correct there? LARSON: Well, if that were to be true. But here is the thing, there is no question about the fact that we need to take care of the docs and we need to emphasize primary care. But also what never gets discussed, Candy, is something that Reuters came out with earlier this year, $700 billion annually in inefficiencies in this system, lack of interoperability in hospitals, lack of a continuum of care, and fraud and abuse -- $700 billion.



I think that we're going to -- that's $7 trillion over a 10-year period. I think that we're more than going to be able to wring out the cost in there. I think that's why the president brought people down to Washington, to the White House, that's why he brought the six (ph) in to try to wring out those costs as we go forward.



You know, we spend 20 percent of gross domestic product. The closest country to us is Switzerland. I can't believe that we can't get that money out of there.



CROWLEY: Can't we get that money out of there?



PENCE: Yes, yes, we do such a great job here in Washington wringing out the cost.



LARSON: Now that's in the private sector.



PENCE: One-point-six trillion dollar deficit this year, you know, only in Washington D.C. could you say with a straight face that you are going to spend $1 trillion and save tax-payers money. Look, you point out the doc fix. This is a total fraud. The Democrats are leaving out $200 billion in spending that the speaker of the house committed again this week to spend, which makes this -- even using this CBO's numbers, it makes it a bill that adds to the deficit in the short term and in the long term.



But look, even beyond that, Candy, the American people know that you expand the federal government's role in health care without giving the American people more health care choices by purchasing across state lines, without passing any medical malpractice reform at all -- roughly a third of health care costs in this country I hear are actually defensive medicine driven by junk lawsuits.



The American people know this is going to cost more and add more to the deficit, add more to the debt, cost higher taxes even than the rosiest scenarios that are presented...



LARSON: The CBO is the bible. The CBO says...



CROWLEY: It is, but it's not always accurate, as you know.



LARSON: We have arguments with them all of the time, but...



CROWLEY: Somebody once told me that predicting...



LARSON: ... that's all that we can -- that's all that we can vote on.



CROWLEY: Sure, absolutely. But it still is one of those things that we might not find out...



PENCE: And the president...



CROWLEY: ... except for 10 years from now.



LARSON: And the president has put in numerous reforms that are going to take effect, including the inability to rescind your insurance policy, pre-existing conditions. For women across this country, Candy, I mean, there birth is a pre-existing condition, domestic violence is a pre-existing condition, a C-section is a pre- existing condition, in-vitro fertilization, come on.



(CROSSTALK)



PENCE: My wife had to -- John, my wife had a pre-existing condition. I lost my job about 15 years ago. My wife had a pre- existing condition. She was pregnant with our daughter Audrey. We went to the state guarantee fund, a fund that would be replenished if we passed medical malpractice reform, we could use the savings to strengthen those funds to cover people like my wife was covered.



You don't need a government takeover of health care. You don't need to mandate that every American purchase health insurance whether they want it or need it or not, and you don't need to put us on a pathway towards socialized medicine.



LARSON: Where is the takeover by the government?



PENCE: And that's what this crowd is doing today.



LARSON: Where is the takeover by the government? CROWLEY: Let me ask you something, just turn...



LARSON: Humana runs Medicare currently. Tricare is run by them. Where is the takeover of government?



PENCE: Well, I'll break it down. John, if you mandate that every American purchase health insurance, you mandate that every business provide it...



LARSON: Do we mandate that people get car insurance?



PENCE: ... you create a...



(CROSSTALK)



PENCE: ... so that people end up in government-run insurance, and you provide public funding for abortion, you mandate insurance plans, cover it within the exchange...



LARSON: There is no funding for abortion in this bill.



PENCE: It is a government takeover of health care.



LARSON: There is no funding for abortion in this bill. It follows Hyde. That's not -- that's the case. PENCE: John, you know that is not true. The Catholic Church...



LARSON: I know it's absolutely true.



PENCE: ... the Catholic bishops, the right to life says...



LARSON: Sixty thousand nuns can't be wrong.



PENCE: ... public funding for abortions is in this bill.



LARSON: Thank God for the sisters of Notre Dame, that's what I think.



CROWLEY: Let me call a time here, because we are out of time. But for more of this, our audience can tune into the House debate starting this afternoon. And I suspect that pass or not pass, this debate continues as we watch how it goes.



LARSON: That's right. Very strong disagreements. But Mike Pence is an honorable man. And I look forward to this debate, and as are our colleagues. I hope that we do ratchet down the conversation though, because when two of our colleagues are spat on and hurled racial slurs, it is time...



CROWLEY: It did indeed happen.



LARSON: ... it's time to ratchet down things a little bit.



PENCE: Well, I'll tell you, I was in Selma with John Lewis, if what is reported to have happened was reported is contemptible, I denounce it in the strongest terms. But I assure you, this debate will not end today.



LARSON: I agree with that.



CROWLEY: Or probably on this show.



LARSON: I agree with that.



CROWLEY: Thank you very much, I appreciate it.



LARSON: There is going to be a lot of work to go to...



CROWLEY: If health care reform wins passage in the House today, the measure heads back to the Senate. Up next, a quick tutorial on what happens next. And then a conversation with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein and Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CROWLEY: A quick reality check for those who today's House votes will bring us to the finish line, not quite, not yet. If House Democrats muster the votes today, two things happen. First the Senate version of health care reform will be passed by the House and will then be ready for the president to sign into law. Second, House Democrats will pass a fix-it bill, a companion measure of sorts to correct the things they don't like about the Senate measure. That bill has to go to the Senate. If the Senate goes the easy route, they will pass the fixes without change and send it off to the president. But if the Senate changes anything, if it adds or subtracts from the House measure, it must go back to the House for another vote before it goes to the president.



Senate Republicans have some options which could delay or change the bill, including parliamentary challenges to any part of it as unrelated to the budget. Why didn't the ""Schoolhouse Rock"" teach us about this? We will do our best to get answers on what comes next from senators Orrin Hatch and Dianne Feinstein right after the break.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CROWLEY: As we explained, even if the health care reform bill wins passage in the House later today, it still has another legislative hurdle to clear, back to the Senate for those changes or fixes, if you will, that House Democrats want.



Joining us, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.



So the other day I noticed, Senator Hatch, that you said it would be nuts for anyone to believe that this is the House's last word on this. You think the Senate will change the fix-it bill that's coming over to you?



HATCH: Well, if the rules are followed, they'd have to. Because there is a Social Security component. And you can't do that on reconciliation. There's also an appropriations component as well.



So if -- if the parliamentarian upholds that and Joe Biden doesn't overrule the parliamentarian, which would be a first, then it seems to me that it's going to have to be sent back to the House. So anybody that thinks that this is only going to be a one-time deal today in the House, I think, is grossly mistaken.



CROWLEY: Senator Feinstein, do you think it's possible for the Senate to take that bill and just go, OK, fine with us?



FEINSTEIN: Yes, I do. And I think that's exactly what we'll do. And I really disagree with my friend and colleague. I believe there are at least 51 votes there. I think the bill has been carefully vetted with the parliamentarian. I believe he will stand for each part of it.



And the bill that the House passes today goes to the president. He signs it. Then the reconciliation bill comes over to us. We'll probably begin debate on Tuesday. It will be posted -- it takes some time -- begin debate on Tuesday.



Now, I'm sure what Senator Hatch's party will do is submit a whole host of amendments. We'll have a major vote-a-thon. And this will go on for several days. And I believe, at the end, more than 51 Democrats will hold firm and will pass the reconciliation bill and we will have health care reform. I can say, for my state, the reconciliation bill is very important. Because we have now 8 million people without any insurance in California. The number has gone up 1 million people a year for the last two years. So this bill is necessary.



CROWLEY: Senator Hatch, I want to ask you about the vote-a-thon, but I first want to play something Senator Reid said recently.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



SEN. HARRY REID, D-NEV., SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: We're in the last minute of play. The shot clock is turned off. The other side knows what the outcome will be. So they're trying to foul us and foul us and foul us and foul us again, just to keep the clock from reading zero. They're not just delaying the inevitable; they're delaying the imperative.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CROWLEY: Are you going on after -- after the shot clock has...



(LAUGHTER)



I mean, you know, Senator Feinstein calls it a vote-a-thon. I mean, is this the Republican approach to this now, is just to delay the inevitable?



HATCH: Well, not really. I think it's to try and get amendments passed that really are valid amendments. I think, if you have a Social Security component in it, it has -- it has to come back to the House. And a parliamentarian has to rule the right way.



But who knows? I don't know what the parliamentarian is going to do. All I can say is this. You know, as I walk around this country, and I've been all over the country, people come up to me from everywhere, Democrats, Republicans, saying, we can't afford this; we can't do this. We do not even have solid, final scoring on this.



As a matter of fact, the actuary at CMS said he cannot get the final scoring. They also don't include the doc fix in it, which is $371 billion, and that's at present worth. And that doesn't even take care of Medicaid.



Of the 31 million people you're going to cover, 16 million are pushed into Medicaid.



I mean, let me just tell you, we're coming to a Europeanization of America. And the American people sense it. They feel it. They know that we can't afford this.



And, frankly, the doc fix that they have on Medicaid...



(CROSSTALK) HATCH: He's a letter -- here's a letter from my governor saying -- now, for two years, they say they'll hold the states free. But then you go off the clip because they cannot afford to pay for it in the federal government.



And -- and Medicaid, they're paying -- the doctors are getting 66 percent of what the private sector pays doctors. And they're up in arms. They're not going to take patients now. You can imagine how bad this is going to be if this bill goes through.



CROWLEY: Senator Feinstein, do you worry about either unintended consequences or changes in the economy that could, in the end, if this is made into law, really ruin some aspects of health care?



FEINSTEIN: Well, of course. This isn't the perfect bill. We all know that.



HATCH: Well, that's for sure.



FEINSTEIN: We all know that there are going to have to be fixes down the road, just as every major program has had; Medicare has had; Social Security will likely have because of the explosion of costs.



Having said that, you have to look at the basics. And the basics are that we pay far more than European nations do for health care. And they have a much better performance.



We're about 15 percent; France is 10 percent. And in overall performance by the World Health Organization, France is ranked number one. I think we're ranked 17.



We spend a lot of money, but we don't necessarily spend it in the right way or the right places.



Now, let me just finish. This bill is really important. Because, if we don't pass it now, you can forget health care reform forever after, I believe. So this is the opportunity. We're right at the goal line. I believe it's going to pass the House. It will be signed by the president. We should pass a reconciliation bill.



And I would really appeal to my good friend, Senator Hatch. Let this reconciliation bill get passed. Then, you can see. If it's wrong, you'll certainly say so. If it works, hopefully, you'll say so as well.



CROWLEY: And we'll get your answer right after this, because I've got to take a break. And we'll find out if you listened to her appeal, right after this.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CROWLEY: We are back with two top senators, Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Orrin Hatch.



When last we met, she was asking if you would just let this reconciliation bill go through and see what happens. FEINSTEIN: Suggesting.



(LAUGHTER)



HATCH: Well, let me tell you, Republicans are dedicated against this bill. We consider it an awful bill.



Do you realize they're going to subsidize families that make over -- families of four that make over $80,000 a year?



I mean, we're getting to where 50 percent of the people in this country are going to depend on subsidies. And, of course, I know Dianne can't agree with that or doesn't believe in that.



But -- and all I can say is -- is, everywhere I go, people say, how do we pay for this? You know, in all honesty, they have jacked up the costs of Medicare. They're going to take better than $500 billion, now, out of Medicare. They're going to increase taxes by over $500 billion. They're going to sock it to individuals who don't -- who can't afford to buy insurance. They're going to have to pay 2.5 percent of their gross income.



Businesses are now going to have to pay up to $3,000 per employee if they don't provide health insurance.



You reach a point where you say, who is going to pay for all of this? And it's going to come down to us taxpayers. And like I say, it's the Europeanization of America, and that's the worst thing that could possibly happen to our country.



CROWLEY: You -- you said earlier that, of course, there were things that worried you about the bill. If you looked at in the totality, what worries you the most?



Is there anything that he says that you think, you know, yes, that is a worry of mine?



FEINSTEIN: Well, there -- the bill is a combination of a number of different things designed to cover more people. The bill has very big strong points. For example, right away, there's a $5 billion fund for people with pre-existing conditions who can't get health insurance today.



HATCH: We're both for that. We're both for that.



FEINSTEIN: That's a very positive thing.



HATCH: Sure.



FEINSTEIN: So the bill, when really accumulated, the Congressional Budget Office says, will save, over 10 years, $138 billion.



Now, Orrin will say, well, it's not this; it's not that; it's not the other thing. But that's the fact that we go on when we assess a bill. CROWLEY: But isn't also true, Senator...



FEINSTEIN: So over 10 years, this bill, I'm confident, will not cost more.



Now, as I said, are there certain parts that may have to be tweaked, that don't work exactly right? But he has given a litany of complaints about the bill. The thrust of the bill is to provide more people with coverage.



One of the good things the bill does is it reduces the nonpremium costs for those 85 percent of people that have medical health insurance. It reduces it from 20 percent to 15 percent so that more money from insurance companies will actually go for medical care. And I think that's important.



CROWLEY: Politically, isn't it going to be hard to argue, should this bill pass, and we think it will, just given the numbers, to say, listen, people are now going to be -- not be thrown off their insurance because they got sick. There will be no more caps.



FEINSTEIN: Exactly.



CROWLEY: There will be help for people down the road, to help subsidize it. How can you argue against that? Isn't that a pretty political powerful package?



HATCH: Well, I'm not arguing -- I'm not arguing against that. I think Republicans certainly -- we could agree on a large percentage of things together. But there was really no effort to get us involved.



All I can say is this, is that everywhere I go -- and I've said it over and over -- people say, how are you going to pay for this? How do you pay for it?



Now, the CMS actuary -- that's the actuary for the administration -- says the cost curve will not be bent, that premiums are going to go up. I have to say that I believe that -- that CBO -- of course they have to decide these budgetary matters based upon the papers given them by the House of Representatives and by the Senate, and those papers are stacked in favor of trying to live within our means, but they don't.



The fact is that they double-count in this bill. They have all kinds of other gimmicks in this bill that try to get this bill down to -- everybody knows that this, extrapolated over 10 years, is going to be $2.5 trillion more on top of what we're already spending, $2.4 trillion.



You cannot tell me that this country can afford to do that and that we can't find a way, by working together, to really come up with a health care system that will work and work within financial means.



CROWLEY: I'm going to give you the last short word. And that is, are you comfortable with the cost of this bill...



FEINSTEIN: Yes.



CROWLEY: ... and comfortable the country can afford it?



FEINSTEIN: Yes. I believe we can. And I believe that will be sorted out over time.



I think there's one thing that isn't in the bill, that the president was good enough to take my bill, which would give the secretary of health and human services some control over the rate of premiums to ensure that they are reasonable for people who have private-sector insurance. Unfortunately, the parliamentarian said that could not be added to the reconciliation bill. I have introduced it as a separate bill.



I believe this is a huge problem out there. You have Anthem in California and 800,000 policies just jacking up premiums up to 39 percent in California and then saying there may be another increase in the middle of the year.



And so people are being pushed off of their health insurance because of the cost of premiums. And this is one thing we need to strengthen, in my view, and hopefully will as a separate piece of legislation.



CROWLEY: Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Orrin Hatch, I can't thank you both enough for coming. I appreciate it.



FEINSTEIN: Thank you.



HATCH: Thank you.



CROWLEY: More of this on the Senate floor next week...



FEINSTEIN: Oh, you bet.



CROWLEY: ... we promise. (LAUGHTER)



FEINSTEIN: Thank you.



CROWLEY: Up next, in our ""American Dispatch,"" why, despite the claims of some politicians, it's hard to say exactly how most Americans feel about the health reform bill. And then Donna Brazile and Ben Bennett on the potential fallout for both Democratic and Republican lawmakers up for re-election this fall.

CROWLEY: Our ""American Dispatch"" looks at a central question. What do Americans think?



House Republican Leader John Boehner answers for Republicans.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



BOEHNER: Because the American people are saying ""Stop,"" and they're screaming at the top of their lungs. (END VIDEO CLIP)



CROWLEY: But are they? Two polls released this week leave lots of room for debate. A Pew poll released Thursday asks, ""Do you favor or oppose the current bill?""



Only 38 percent said they favor it. So is Minority Leader Boehner right?



A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll asks, ""Is it better to pass the Obama plan or keep the current system?""



The respondents were split right down the middle.



Is it in the way the question is asked? Are more people more likely to support it when it's called the Obama plan or is it that people think some change is better than no change?



You be the judge. We will sort through the complicated politics of all this with Donna Brazile and Bill Bennett after a short break.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CROWLEY: Joining me here in Washington, two of my favorite people, CNN political contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile and CNN political contributor and host of ""Morning in America,"" Bill Bennett, who is also author of the new book ""A Century Turns."" These authors and stuff, OK.



The politics of all this. John Larson, head of the Democratic caucus, says they've got the 216, done deal, goes over to the Senate, Dianne Feinstein all confident they're going to pass it. It's going to be law. How does this all play out politically? I want to play you something the -- two things, actually, the president said yesterday. First, there was this.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



OBAMA: I am actually confident -- I've talked to some of you individually -- that it will end up being the smart thing to do politically, because I believe that good policy is good politics.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CROWLEY: OK, now, about two minutes later, he had this to say.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



OBAMA: Now, I can't guarantee that this is good politics. Every one of you know your districts better than I do.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CROWLEY: So, let's see, I'm thinking we're not really sure how the politics are going to play out. What do you think? BENNETT: Yes, well, as a former teacher of logic, he didn't contradict himself, because he said I believe this will be good politics because it's good policy, but I can't guarantee it. OK, we've heard that before.



I think it's bad politics, because I think it's bad policy, and not just from a partisan point of view, but let me just do it analytically. You would not have so many nervous Democrats if this looked like it was really good politics. I don't think it is.



And, again, I think, when we see how this plays out, one play will be in November with the midterm elections. Another play, we'll see what happens with budget issues.



And since misrepresentations are all over the place in this -- in this proposal, and you look at a state like Massachusetts, which is a state closest to what this federal program is, I think they're going to regret it. Be careful what you wish for, Richard Butler (ph) said, because you may get it.

74	"MR. OBAMA: I said during the campaign that Iran is a country that has extraordinary people, extraordinary history and traditions, but that its actions over many years now have been unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and prosperity both in the region and around the world; that their attacks or -- or their -- their financing of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas, the bellicose language that they've used towards Israel, their development of a nuclear weapon or their pursuit of a nuclear weapon -- that all of those things create the possibility of destabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests, but I think are contrary to the interests of international peace.

What I've also said is that we should take an approach with Iran that employs all of the resources at the United States' disposal, and that includes diplomacy. And so my national security team is currently reviewing our existing Iran policy, looking at areas where we can have constructive dialogue, where we can directly engage with them. And my expectation is, in the coming months, we will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table, face to face; of diplomatic overtures that will allow us to move our policy in a new direction.

There's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight.

And it's important that even as we engage in this direct diplomacy, we are very clear about certain deep concerns that we have as a country, that Iran understands that we find the funding of terrorist organizations unacceptable, that we're clear about the fact that a nuclear Iran could set off a nuclear arms race in the region that would be profoundly destabilizing. So there are going to be a set of objectives that we have in these conversations, but I think that there's the possibility, at least, of a relationship of mutual respect and progress.

And I think that if you look at how we've approached the Middle East, my designation of George Mitchell as a special envoy to help deal with the Arab-Israeli situation, some of the interviews that I've given, it indicates the degree to which we want to do things differently in the region. Now it's time for Iran to send some signals that it wants to act differently as well and recognize that even as it is has some rights as a member of the international community, with those rights come responsibilities.

Okay.

President Obama, joined by his wife and daughters, served Thanksgiving dinner in a D.C. shelter Wednesday to highlight the administration's efforts to end homelessness among U.S veterans. The first family visited Friendship Place, which is located in the basement of St. LukeÃ¢ÂÂs Church in Northwest Washington. The shelter, which received a $3.1 million grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs this year to improve its capacity to address veteran homelessness, operates the program Veterans First, a leading provider of housing services to veterans and their families in the area that currently serves 550 households.

The Obamas, along with some friends, served dinner as part of the shelter's ""Feast with Friends"" event. Each member of the family had assigned duties: The president served turkey and ladled gravy; Michelle Obama distributed vegetables; Malia doled out mashed potatoes; Sasha gave out stuffing and cranberry sauce and Marian Robinson dished out macaroni and cheese.

""We appreciate you,Ã¢ÂÂ the president said, asking another, Ã¢ÂÂHow you been?""

Obama also asked those partaking in the meal if they preferred white or dark meat.

The White House, which first launched an effort to end homelessness in June 2010, has intensified its push targeting homeless veterans this year. The mayors of the 25 cities with the largest populations of homeless veterans in the nation have publicly pledged to end veteran homelessness in their communities by the end of this year, and Virginia announced on Veterans Day it had become the first state to end homelessness among those who have served in the military.

Homelessness among American veterans declined 36 percent between 2010 and January 2015, according to White House officials, with unsheltered homelessness among veterans decreasing by 50 percent during that same period."	1
78	"Senator John McCain should be supporting President Donald Trump and his Congressional peers in order to make America safe again but he obviously felt the need to go around the White House and call the Australian Ambassador to offer his Ã¢ÂÂunwavering support.Ã¢ÂÂ, reports Angry Patriot.

McCain called the Australian ambassador, to pass on a message to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that might be a violation of the Logan Act. The law prevents citizens from interfering in disputes the United States is having with foreign countries.

The Senator stated that Australia is one of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs oldest friends and staunchest allies and in that spirit, he called AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs Ambassador to the United States to express his unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance.

According to the Logan Act, any citizen of the United States who Ã¢ÂÂwithout permission of the United StatesÃ¢ÂÂ either directly or indirectly Ã¢ÂÂcommences or carries on correspondenceÃ¢ÂÂ with any foreign government or any officer of another government, to Ã¢ÂÂinfluence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officerÃ¢ÂÂ in ongoing controversies or disputes with America, shall be fined or sent to prison for three yearsÃ¢ÂÂ or both.

McCain claimed that he asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote.

Even if McCain is still the sitting Senator from Arizona, that does not exempt him from the dictates of the Logan Act. Among the conflicting reports by CNN about the conversation between Trump and his Australian counterpart, Senator McCain called to offer his Ã¢ÂÂunwavering supportÃ¢ÂÂ to the foreign leader.

Former President Barack Obama created the deal shortly before leaving the office. Australia had denied access to the immigrants based upon security concerns and would not have refused entry to the refugees and detained them offshore without a valid reason. Both President Trump and Prime Minister Turnbull have denied any acrimony occurred during their phone call. Even if it had, that still does not mean that President Trump was not doing what he vowed to do, which is protecting America.

And in case you missed itÃ¢ÂÂ¦ The Gateway Pundit has previously posted on the several discrepancies with Beverly NelsonÃ¢ÂÂs press conference.

Following The Gateway PunditÃ¢ÂÂs viral story on Judge Roy MooreÃ¢ÂÂs alleged signature inside accuser Beverly Young NelsonÃ¢ÂÂs yearbook, more evidence suggested it was a forgery.

CNN published photos of the signature showing two different inks.

The signature says Ã¢ÂÂTo a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, Ã¢ÂÂMerry Christmas.Ã¢ÂÂ Love, Roy Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House.Ã¢ÂÂ

Strangely, Ã¢ÂÂTo a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, Ã¢ÂÂMerry Christmas.Ã¢ÂÂ Love, Roy,Ã¢ÂÂ is written in black ink, while Ã¢ÂÂMoore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House,Ã¢ÂÂ is in blue ink.

The shutdown isn't good for anyone in our community or our country. MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa has furloughed more than 1,500 employees, putting our national security at risk before Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sent them back to work this week. Veterans in my district are facing a possible future suspension in claims processing. Tax refunds can't go out. Citrus growers can't access the E-Verify system to ensure work authorization is approved, which limits their hiring ability.

Unfortunately, President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have been unreasonable and unwilling to negotiate, which led to this government shutdown. We can end this if they would join us at the table and compromise, but Senate leaders and our president won't budge.

I want to be clear: I have never supported Obamacare and have voted more than 40 times to defund it, delay it, or repeal it. I went a step further and introduced an amendment to the continuing resolution that would ensure that the full extent of Obamacare applies to members of Congress, the president, the vice president and staff. The House passed my amendment with bipartisan support. Unfortunately, the Democratic-controlled Senate hasn't passed any of these bills and refused to even vote on my amendment. We are badly mistaken to think there is any hope of the president eliminating his signature legislation, as awful as it is.

Shutting down the government has had zero impact on Obamacare. Unfortunately, some were led to believe that Obamacare would immediately cease if the government shut down. The reality is, however, that despite the government being shut down for multiple days, Obamacare continues to be implemented with all of its glitches and problems. That is because about 70 percent of Obamacare is funded through mandatory funding while the current funding battle only addresses discretionary funding Ã¢ÂÂ it doesn't even touch mandatory funding.

Since its grand opening on Oct. 1, Obamacare has been an abject failure. Countless technical glitches have prevented enrollees from accessing the online exchanges, and there are endless reports of consumer sticker shock from the high cost of Obamacare insurance premiums. Americans deserve to know that Obamacare is a disaster. Yet these failures and many more have been overshadowed by the government shutdown and the debate over a continuing resolution that, by law, could never fully defund Obamacare.

Obamacare will fall under its own weight of complexities, costs and inconsistencies, all at the expense of the American people. The best way to repeal Obamacare is to let it take effect, point out its impact, win control of the Senate, and elect a president who will support its repeal.

In the few years since I was elected to Congress in 2010, we have achieved huge savings and taken monumental steps. For the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row. We need to continue to take steps forward, shedding off our ""excessive funding weight"" one pound at a time. That is why I would support a continuing resolution that funds the government at sequestration levels for one year.

We need to get the government running again and end this shutdown so that our communities can get back on their feet.

81	"WASHINGTON ÃÂ Even though federal health officials have begun a criminal investigation into whether the Peanut Corporation of America deliberately sold contaminated products, the government still needed the companyÃ¢ÂÂs permission last week before announcing a huge recall of its products.

The wording of the recall statement had to be approved by the company before the Food and Drug Administration could publish it under current rules. The agency relies on cooperation from food makers to ensure the safety of the food supply even when those makers are suspected of crimes.

Some Democrats in Congress have vowed to change this by giving the F.D.A. more authority, and the agencyÃ¢ÂÂs critics say it is too timid with the power it has.

On Monday, President Obama promised a Ã¢ÂÂcomplete review of F.D.A. operations.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂI think that the F.D.A. has not been able to catch some of these things as quickly as I expect them to catch,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Obama said in an interview on the Ã¢ÂÂTodayÃ¢ÂÂ show."	0
82	"The former Paralympic athlete reportedly tried to commit suicide.

Convicted murderer Oscar Pistorius was, according to reports, rushed to a local state hospital in the early hours of Saturday after he allegedly attempted on his life.

Although information is still sketchy, a social media report claimed that the former Paralympic athlete had injured his wrists in his prison cell.

He was rushed to a nearby hospital.

According to City Press, correctional services said Pistorius claimed he had injured himself after falling out of bed.

Ã¢ÂÂAn inmate situated close to the hospital section told City Press that Pistorius had injured himself intentionally,Ã¢ÂÂ the news report stated.

The report added that sharp blades were subsequently found in PistoriusÃ¢ÂÂ cell during a search on Saturday afternoon.

The reports could not yet be confirmed.

Mashego wrote that he had also established from warders that Pistorius had been planning to harm the Kgosi Mampuru II prisonÃ¢ÂÂs health manager and a nurse, as they had testified against him, describing him as violent. A raid of his cell weeks ago allegedly found Ã¢ÂÂtoxic pillsÃ¢ÂÂ inside it, though these are likely to be prescription drugs and anti-depressants, which might also be used in a suicide attempt.

The Pistorius family told the Sunday paper that they were not aware of any investigation into PistoriusÃ¢ÂÂ alleged plot against the prison staff. They dismissed it as yet another sensationalist story like many others.

The President expressed his appreciation for Senator Ted Kennedy above all today. Lamenting that the senator could not be there for the signing of Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, he called it ""change that's been decades in the making."" By all accounts, it is the strongest measure protecting children from the dangers of smoking to date -- read the fact sheet for all of the details.

He recounted the all-too-familiar statistics: that more than 400,000 Americans now die of tobacco-related illnesses each year; that more than 8 million Americans suffer from at least one serious illness caused by smoking; and that almost 90% of all smokers began at or before their 18th birthday.

He spoke on his personal experience:

I know -- I was one of these teenagers, and so I know how difficult it can be to break this habit when it's been with you for a long time. And I also know that kids today don't just start smoking for no reason. They're aggressively targeted as customers by the tobacco industry. They're exposed to a constant and insidious barrage of advertising where they live, where they learn, and where they play. Most insidiously, they are offered products with flavorings that mask the taste of tobacco and make it even more tempting.

We've known about this for decades, but despite the best efforts and good progress made by so many leaders and advocates with us today, the tobacco industry and its special interest lobbying have generally won the day up on the Hill. When Henry Waxman first brought tobacco CEOs before Congress in 1994, they famously denied that tobacco was deadly, nicotine was addictive, or that their companies marketed to children. And they spent millions upon millions in lobbying and advertising to fight back every attempt to expose these denials as lies.

Fifteen years later, their campaign has finally failed. Today, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans, health care and consumer advocates, the decades-long effort to protect our children from the harmful effects of tobacco has emerged victorious. Today, change has come to Washington.

This legislation will not ban all tobacco products, and it will allow adults to make their own choices. But it will also ban tobacco advertising within a thousand feet of schools and playgrounds. It will curb the ability of tobacco companies to market products to our children by using appealing flavors. It will force these companies to more clearly and publicly acknowledge the harmful and deadly effects of the products they sell. And it will allow the scientists at the FDA to take other common-sense steps to reduce the harmful effects of smoking.

This legislation is a victory for bipartisanship, and it was passed overwhelmingly in both Houses of Congress. It's a victory for health care reform, as it will reduce some of the billions we spend on tobacco-related health care costs in this country. It's a law that will reduce the number of American children who pick up a cigarette and become adult smokers. And most importantly, it is a law that will save American lives and make Americans healthier.

Making clear that this legislation does not represent the end of the road on fighting back the health risks of smoking, the President nonetheless described it as another very significant sign of change in Washington:

Despite the influence of the credit card industry, we passed a law to protect consumers from unfair rate hikes and abusive fees. Despite the influence of banks and lenders, we passed a law to protect homeowners from mortgage fraud. Despite the influence of the defense industry, we passed a law to protect taxpayers from waste and abuse in defense contracting. And today, despite decades of lobbying and advertising by the tobacco industry, we've passed a law to help protect the next generation of Americans from growing up with a deadly habit that so many of our generation have lived with."	0

And it allows our law enforcement officials to focus on criminals who really posed a threat and ought to be the focus here. But the only permanent way to fix our immigration system, certainly to provide a permanently relief for DREAM Act eligible populations is for Congress to act.

WALLACE: You mentioned Governor Romney. I don't to get into the whole thing about the differences will get to the economy in a minute. But specifically for Hispanic voters, do you think there's a clear choice between Obama and Romney?

PLOUFFE: I think there's a clear choice for everybody.

WALLACE: Well, I'm asking about Hispanics.

PLOUFFE: Well, first of all --

WALLACE: On this issue of immigration.

PLOUFFE: Well, first of all, Hispanic voters highly support the health care bill, what we're trying to do in education. On immigration, yes, this is a president who's tried to get immigration done in a comprehensive way. We're getting close to getting the DREAM Act done.

So, this is someone who believed that we are a nation of laws, but also a nation of immigrants. And that people who want to staff our labs and start businesses and serve their country ought to be able to do that. Governor Romney has said he would veto the DREAM Act. Governor Romney essentially said the 11 million here ought to just go home. They ought to self deport.

So, this is someone you're not going to be able to trust. And this one of the important choices that the president talked about earlier this week in Ohio. President Romney if he's elected is not going to fix our immigration system. He's been very clear about that. You watch Republican debate after Republican debate, many of them on your network, where Governor Romney was very clear, he would veto the DREAM Act. He thinks these 11 million people ought to just be sent home.

So, I think that's a clear choice just not for the Latino community, but for the American electorate at large.

WALLACE: All right. Let's turn to the economy. The president gave a major economic speech this week in Ohio in which he called for targeted investments for things like energy and education and state workers, first responders and teachers, and tax hikes for the wealthy. But there was -- forgive me -- nothing new.

Is that the president's agenda for the next four years -- pass the jobs plan that I have been pushing for over the last 12 months and that will fix the economy?

PLOUFFE: What the president laid out is a clear choice facing the American people. And the contrast could not be clear. This is a president who believes we need to grow the economy by putting the middle class first, creating middle class jobs, by reducing the deficit in a fair or balanced way, and making sure we can invest in things like innovation and infrastructure and science and research.

The congressional Republican approach, Governor Romney's approach -- by the way, it's fitting, he's with John Boehner today -- because Governor Romney is going to rubber stamp the Republican agenda, which basically gives huge tax cuts for the wealthy. They believe the economy works best from the top down. That's failed.

By the way, Governor Romney wouldn't reduce the deficit. Every independent economists who's looked at this plan says he would add to the deficit, he would starve investment in education, he would allow infrastructure to deteriorate even more. This is not a recipe for growing the economy, reducing the deficit or helping the middle class. So, that's the stark choice --

WALLACE: Does the president's agenda -- because I did not hear anything new in Ohio -- is the president's agenda for the next four years more of the same?

PLOUFFE: Well, what it is, is what this country needs to do, which is reduce the deficit in a right way, fair and balanced way.

WALLACE: I like the fact that you keep saying fair and balanced.

PLOUFFE: Well, it's the right way, which is we need to cut more spending. This president has already signed into law, by the way, over -- almost $2 trillion on spending cuts. We have to focus on what is going to grow this economy for the middle class. And that's going to be continuing to focus on our manufacturing --

WALLACE: But you would agree, there is no new agenda beyond what he is pushing for the last year?

PLOUFFE: This is the direction he thinks that the country needs to go.

Now, let's look at the other direction, it failed miserably. When Governor Romney led Massachusetts, number one debt in the country -- think about that. Added debt. For all of this talk about government, for every private sector job created in Massachusetts by Governor Romney, six public sector jobs.

This is someone who -- his state was 47 in job creation. And he wants to return to the same policies that led to the great recession that, you know, caused a huge harm to our businesses, our economy and people in this country.

So, the choice is clear here.

WALLACE: OK.

PLOUFFE: The choice is clear.

WALLACE: I have a couple of minutes left and I want to get to these campaign questions. You were the Obama campaign manager in 2008. I ask about whether there's anything new, because you are taking hits right now -- you, the campaign -- from some notable Democrats like James Carville and Bill Clinton, who are saying that you need to stop talking about the progress we've made and start talking about a new agenda, how things in the next four years are going to be different than they were in the last one.

Are they wrong?

PLOUFFE: First of all, President Clinton, he's appeared with President Obama. He said very clearly that we are beginning to grow again. We're beginning to make progress. We can't return to the same policy.

President Clinton is someone knows something about reducing the deficit, about creating jobs, and he's been very clear -- he thinks Mitt Romney would be a disaster for this country.

So, listen, those other Democrats aren't paying attention to what the president said, which is everyday, not just on what he said, but what he does -- he understands our economy is not strong as it needs to be, that this didn't happen overnight, it's going to take us a long time to recover, there's a lot of people out there hurting.

So, we are making progress. We need to make a lot of more. That's very clear.

WALLACE: But you said, just a few months ago, that trajectory in the economy is going well. We had fewer and fewer jobs, each of the last four months. GDP growth is 1.9 percent, 69,000 jobs, the lowest in the year created. The trajectory is not going like this anymore, sir. It's going like this.

PLOUFFE: Well, compared to where we were in recession we had over 4 million jobs created over the last 26 months. We had that private sector jobs --

WALLACE: But you've got three and a half years to fix it. PLOUFFE: Well, listen, this is a deep hole caused by the same policies Mitt Romney wants to go back to. This is what folks need to focus on. We just went through recession.

Remarkably, what Mitt Romney and the congressional Republicans want to do is, hey, I guess that worked out well. Let's go back to the same rules. Let Wall Street writes its own rules, make it easier to polluters to foul our air more, huge tax cuts to people like Mitt Romney and basically paid for by raising taxes on working Americans, and making it harder for people to get education, not believing in the new energy future, not rebuilding this country.

So, listen, this is a tough recession we are recovering from. We are making slow and steady progress. Nobody is satisfied. The president most of all knows we have to recover more quickly, create jobs more quickly. But the choice is, are we going to continue and move forward -- are we going to go back to the same policies that caused the recession?

WALLACE: I got it. One last question --

PLOUFFE: It's important. Nothing is more important than this, Chris.

WALLACE: One more question real quickly, any chance you'll leave the White House, go back to Chicago and run this campaign."	0
86	"Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian Agents

Anonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.

The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds Ã¢ÂÂ literally.

This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name Ã¢ÂÂAlexi JonesinovÃ¢ÂÂ) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.

However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.

It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.

It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.

Ã¢ÂÂWe have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,Ã¢ÂÂ one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control peopleÃ¢ÂÂs actions as Ã¢ÂÂRussian neuro-brain hacking.Ã¢ÂÂ

When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were Ã¢ÂÂridiculous,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂoutrageousÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂgoofy.Ã¢ÂÂ However, Peskov suspiciously asked Ã¢ÂÂvere is Moose and Squirrel?Ã¢ÂÂ

NSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control peopleÃ¢ÂÂs brains, heÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂnever seen anything on this scale before.Ã¢ÂÂ

The Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.

You are all nutsÃ¢ÂÂ¦almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we donÃ¢ÂÂt matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands. And just in case you havenÃ¢ÂÂt noticed, TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs people have most of the guns."	1

BREAKING: NFL Fines Pittsburgh Steelers $1m Each For Skipping National Anthem Ã¢ÂÂ YouTube

The hooey hit the fanbase. That is, when the NFL Black Lives DonÃ¢ÂÂt Matter gang attacked patriotism and the US flag and most of the football fans, this blew up big time to the point, the frightened commissioner of this gang of thugs suddenly woke up and issued his first punishment for the people protesting at games: a million dollars each! I hope for two things: Villanueva is exempt plus since he was intimidated by both coach, the owner of the Steelers and fellow teammates, 50% of this fine should go to him! How about that?



Alejandro Villanueva apologizes for throwing Steeler teammates Ã¢ÂÂunder the busÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ YouTube

Kim of North Korea is now running the NFL, it appears. The abject apology of this poor football player is backfiring very badly. People are twice as angry as before. Now, the hatred of the Ã¢ÂÂother playersÃ¢ÂÂ who dissed the American flag is not gone away, either. They demanded everyone join them in being anti-patriotic and now this poor guy is doing exactly that. The NFL is now in dire straits. Like the DNC, they think they can impose their ideology on everyone else via force. Well, it isnÃ¢ÂÂt working at all.

As I said above, Villanueva is the only member of that Ã¢ÂÂteamÃ¢ÂÂ that stood up for America and he was then muscled by thugs threatening his life and livelihood and who forced him to do a miserable retraction of his good, patriotic deed. People are very angry at him for surrendering but then, he had everyone against him. Now, he should be rehabilitated, he needs a HUGE apology from the entire NFL leadership and his former teammates.

Fire chief apologizes for calling SteelersÃ¢ÂÂ coach Mike Tomlin Ã¢ÂÂn-wordÃ¢ÂÂ on Facebook | TribLIVE

Chief Paul Smith, who leads CecilÃ¢ÂÂs Volunteer Fire Department No. 2 in Muse, Washington County, posted the comment in response to the SteelersÃ¢ÂÂ decision not to not take the field for the national anthem. Ã¢ÂÂTomlin just added himself to the list of no good n-words. Yes I said it,Ã¢ÂÂ Smith wrote in the post.CecilÃ¢ÂÂs board of supervisors said the comment was troublesome. Ã¢ÂÂThe Cecil Township Board of Supervisors is deeply disturbed by the comments made by volunteer Chief Smith, and in no way, shape or form condone his comments,Ã¢ÂÂ officials said in a written statement.

See? This man said something rash. He is immediately punished. The NFL players who decided to toss the US flag in the trash and attack the President for talking about their disrespect of the US voters and citizensÃ¢ÂÂ¦they should also be punished heavily, no? Of course! Liberals think PC punishment is a one way street.

They can cuss, swear, be abusive, harass and even physically attack fellow citizens and nothing is done to stop this! But anyone else says the wrong words and they lose their jobs and are punished in many ways. This is causing tremendous ire and is the #1 reason many voted for Trump.

Not One More Dime: NFL Stadiums Have Collected Over $1.1 Billion in Federal Subsidies Ã¢ÂÂ Time to Cut Them Off. Calls to stop the NFL gravy train is rising. Even if Goodell manages to muscle the teams into behaving themselves, it is not going to work for the fan base can see that the people playing the game really hate them and so this comrade business is kaput.

According to FOX Sports over the last 20 years, the American public has spent more than $7 billion dollars to build or renovate NFL stadiums, taking on 46 percent of the total costs of those projects. ItÃ¢ÂÂs time to cut them off. They donÃ¢ÂÂt respect the country. Why should the country respect them?

The coach of the Steelers sponsored HillaryÃ¢ÂÂs run for President. Note the loot she asked for, show up to see her, you had to pay $330000+. What a rip-off!

Pushing this pile of toothpaste back into the tube is impossible now. petition: CUT OFF ALL FEDERAL TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES TO NFL, PAYING BILLIONS TO LEAGUE. NO MORE . is one example.

NFL gives up tax exempt status Ã¢ÂÂ Apr. 28, 2015 which was about time. But they still suck off the public teat via moving teams around while making demands for freebies like free stadiums, etc. NFL gets billions in subsidies from U.S. taxpayers Ã¢ÂÂ Jan. 30, 2015 despite being Ã¢ÂÂtaxedÃ¢ÂÂ lightly.

Stadium construction: Twenty new NFL stadiums have opened since 1997 with the help of $4.7 billion in taxpayer funds, according to an analysis by the advisory firm Conventions, Sports and Leisure. Local governments pony up to build these venues to attract or keep teams in their towns. Two more stadiums now under construction in Minneapolis and Atlanta are being built with $700 million in government funds. Taxpayers paid for most of the University of Phoenix Stadium, which opened in 2006 and is home to this SundayÃ¢ÂÂs Super Bowl Ã¢ÂÂ to the tune of about $300 million.

All this will go crashing down unless the team owners wake up and figure out who their audience really is. But then, the cities are being systematically destroyedÃ¢ÂÂ¦"	1
89	BUSTED: Obama is Holding Secret Meetings to OVERTAKE the White House	1
90	"It's not often you see someone stand up and say, ""Tax me more!""

Yet that's just what famed investor Warren Buffett has done in an op-ed in the New York Times headlined, ""Stop Coddling the Super-Rich."" Buffett says that very wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class, thanks to special tax categories for investment income.

""While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks,"" he writes.

As an example, Buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent, averaging 36 percent.



""If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine Ã¢ÂÂ most likely by a lot,"" Buffett wrote. ""To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""



Buffett's op-ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffett's numbers could be correct. As our previous fact-checks have shown, about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income. And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes, it's people with higher incomes. So we decided to fact-check Buffett's statement that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. ... (The middle class) fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""

Before we get to the heart of the fact-check, it's best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffett's op-ed takes for granted. This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us.



Income taxes. Federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money. Let's take a married couple filing jointly as an example. In 2011, after deductions and exemptions:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the income between $139,350 and $212,300 is taxed at 28 percent;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the income between $212,300 and $379,150 is taxed at 33 percent;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the income above $379,150 is taxed at 35 percent.

Keep in mind that even if you're in the top bracket of 35 percent, you don't pay that tax rate on all your income. You pay 10 percent on the first $17,000, 15 percent on the money between $17,000 and $69,000, and so on.

Payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes. If you work for a company, your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government. These taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. The employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. Last year, though, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. Oh, and if you're self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income. Payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates don't get higher the more you earn. In the case of the Social Security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap.

Head hurt yet? Ours, too.

Taxes on investments. Okay, now we're getting closer to Buffett's main point here, and that's taxes on investments. The tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income. If you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

Some hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as ""carried interest"" and taxed as a capital gain. (The Wall Street Journal breaks down how carried interest works.) In fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains. Defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship. They also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends. We won't settle the argument here, but there's no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers.

Getting back to Buffett's op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other. The fact we're checking here is that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes,"" while middle class taxpayers ""fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""

He's right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job. Very little of this taxpayer's income is wage income, so payroll taxes don't take much of a bite. It seems likely that much of this hypothetical person's income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate. And, in fact, as Buffett says, statistics from the Internal Revenue Service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent.

On the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. It gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

Buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent. And, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income. We're dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as Buffett claims someone in his office now pays. (The top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the Tax Policy Center.) We contacted Buffett's offices as Berkshire Hathaway about this point but didn't hear back.

One final note: People who don't pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income. When Buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, he's thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries.

So when it comes to Buffett's statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really rich. And the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well-to-do counterparts -- if their income comes primarily from investments. Overall, we rate Buffett's statement True."	0

Updated: The Facts About Hillary ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs Emails

WeÃ¢ÂÂve put all of the information about Hillary ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs State Department emails here. Just the facts, all in one place.

Why did Clinton use her own email account?

When Clinton got to the Department, she opted to use her personal email account as a matter of convenience. It enabled her to reach people quickly and keep in regular touch with her family and friends more easily given her travel schedule.

That is the only reason she used her own account.

Her usage was widely known to the over 100 State Department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed, consistent with the practice of prior Secretaries of State and permitted at the time.

As Clinton has said, in hindsight, it would have been better to just have two accounts. While she thought using one account would be easier, obviously, that has not been the case.

Was it allowed?

Yes. The laws, regulations, and State Department policy in place during her tenure permitted her to use a non-government email for work.

The 2009 National Archives regulation in place during her tenure required that ""[a]gencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system."" The regulation recognizes the use of non-government email accounts.

As she has stated, Clinton's practice was to email government officials on their "".gov"" accounts, so her work emails were immediately captured and preserved. In fact, more than 90% of those emails should have already been captured in the State DepartmentÃ¢ÂÂs email system before she provided them with paper copies.

A Politifact analysis also confirmed that Clinton's practices complied with laws and regulations, including support from the former director of a prominent government accountability organization: ""In Clinton's defense, we should note that it was only after Clinton left the State Department, that the National Archives issued a recommendation that government employees should avoid conducting official business on personal emails (though they noted there might be extenuating circumstances such as an emergency that require it). Additionally, in 2014, President Barack Obama signed changes to the Federal Records Act that explicitly said federal officials can only use personal email addresses if they also copy or send the emails to their official account. Because these rules weren't in effect when Clinton was in office, 'she was in compliance with the laws and regulations at the time,' said Gary Bass, founder and former director of OMB Watch, a government accountability organization.""

Clinton said she did not use her email to send or receive classified information, but the State Department and two Inspectors General said some of these emails do contain classified information. Was her statement inaccurate?

Clinton only used her account for unclassified email. No information in Clinton's emails was marked classified at the time she sent or received them.

When information is reviewed for public release, it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic relations.

After reviewing a sampling of the 55,000 pages of emails, the Inspectors General have proffered that a small number of emails, which did not contain any classified markings and/or dissemination controls, should have been classified at the time they were sent. The State Department has said it disagrees with this assessment.

Clinton hopes the State Department and the agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which of the 55,000 pages of emails are appropriate to share with the public.

How did Clinton receive and consume classified information?

The Secretary's office was located in a secure area. Classified information was viewed in hard copy by Clinton while in the office. While on travel, the State Department had rigorous protocols for her and traveling staff to receive and transmit information of all types.

A separate, closed email system was used by the State Department for the purpose of handling classified communications, which was designed to prevent such information from being transmitted anywhere other than within that system.

Is Department of Justice conducting a criminal inquiry into ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs email use?

No. As the Department of Justice and Inspectors General made clear, the IGs made a security referral. This was not criminal in nature as misreported by some in the press. The Department of Justice is now seeking assurances about the storage of materials related to ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs email account.

Is it true that her email server and a thumb drive were recently turned over to the government? Why?

Again, when information is reviewed for public release, it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic relations.

Clinton hopes that State and the other agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which emails are appropriate to share with the public, and that the release will be as timely and as transparent as possible.

When the Department upgraded some of the previously unclassified email to classified, her team worked with the State Department to ensure copies of her emails were stored in a safe and secure manner. She also directed her team to give her server that hosted her email account while she was Secretary to the Department of Justice, as well as a thumb drive containing copies of her emails that already had been provided to the State Department. Clinton has pledged to cooperate with the government's security inquiry.

Would this issue not have arisen if she used a state.gov email address?

Even if Clinton's emails had been on a government email address and government device, these questions would be raised prior to public release.

While the State Department's review of her 55,000 emails brought the issue to the Inspectors Generals' attentions, the emails that recently were upgraded to classified prior to public release were on the unclassified .gov email system. They were not on the separate, closed system used by State Department for handling classified communications.

Have Clinton's State Department aides also been asked to provide the Department and Congress with emails from their personal accounts?

We understand that members of her State Department staff were recently asked to assist the Department in its record-keeping by providing any work-related emails they may have on personal accounts. They have received requests from Rep. Gowdy as well.

Clinton is proud of the work of all the dedicated public servants that were part of her team at the State Department. She was proud of her aides then and is proud of them now, as they have committed - as she has - to being as helpful as possible in responding to requests.

Press reports say she used multiple devices Ã¢ÂÂ a Blackberry and an iPad Ã¢ÂÂ is that true?

Clinton relied on her Blackberry for emailing. This was easiest for her. When the iPad came out in 2010, she was as curious as others and found it great for shopping, browsing, and reading articles when she traveled. She also had access to her email account on her iPad and sometimes used it for that too.

Was she ever provided guidance about her use of a non-"".gov"" email account?

The State Department has and did provide guidance regarding the need to preserve federal records. To address these requirements, it was her practice to email government employees on their "".gov"" email address. That way, work emails would be immediately captured and preserved in government record-keeping systems.

What did Clinton provide to the State Department?

On December 5, 2014, 30,490 copies of work or potentially work-related emails sent and received by Clinton from March 18, 2009, to February 1, 2013, were provided to the State Department. This totaled roughly 55,000 pages. More than 90% of her work or potentially work-related emails provided to the Department were already in the State Department's record-keeping system because those e-mails were sent to or received by ""state.gov"" accounts.

Early in her term, Clinton continued using an att.blackberry.net account that she had used during her Senate service. Given her practice from the beginning of emailing State Department officials on their state.gov accounts, her work-related emails during these initial weeks would have been captured and preserved in the State Department's record-keeping system. She, however, no longer had access to these emails once she transitioned from this account.

Why did the Select Committee announce that she used multiple email addresses during her tenure?

In fairness to the Committee, this was an honest misunderstanding. Clinton used one email account during her tenure at State (with the exception of her initial weeks in office while transitioning from an email account she had previously used). In March 2013, a month after she left the Department, Gawker published the email address she used while Secretary, and so she had to change the address on her account.

At the time the printed copies were provided to the Department in 2014, because it was the same account, the new email address established after she left office appeared on the printed copies as the sender, and not the address she used as Secretary. In fact, this address on the account did not exist until March 2013. This led to understandable confusion that was cleared up directly with the Committee after its press conference.

Why didn't Clinton provide her emails to the State Department until December 2014?

In 2014, after recognizing potential gaps in its overall recordkeeping system, the State Department asked for the help of the four previous former Secretaries in meeting the State Department's obligations under the Federal Records Act.

Clinton responded to this request by providing the State Department with over 55,000 pages of emails. As it was Clinton's practice to email U.S. government officials on their .gov accounts, the overwhelming majority of these emails should have already been preserved in the State DepartmentÃ¢ÂÂs email system.

In providing these emails to the Department, Clinton included all she had that were even potentially work-relatedÃ¢ÂÂincluding emails about using a fax machine or asking for iced tea during a meetingÃ¢ÂÂerring on the side of over-inclusion, as confirmed by the Department and National Archives' determination that over 1250 emails were ""personal"" records (which they have indicated will be returned to her).

After providing her work and potentially work-related emails, she chose not to keep her personal, non-work related emails, which by definition, are not federal records and were not requested by the Department or anyone else.

Why did the State Department ask for assistance in collecting records? Why did the State Department need assistance in further meeting its requirements under the Federal Records Act?

The State Department formally requested the assistance of the four previous former Secretaries in a letter to their representatives dated October 28, 2014, to help in further meeting the DepartmentÃ¢ÂÂs requirements under the Federal Records Act.

The letter stated that in September 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) issued new guidance clarifying records management responsibilities regarding the use of personal email accounts for government business.

While this guidance was issued after all four former Secretaries had departed office, the Department decided to ensure its records were as complete as possible and sought copies of work emails sent or received by the Secretaries on their own accounts.

Why did Clinton decide not to keep her personal emails?

As Clinton has said before, these were private, personal messages, including emails about her daughter's wedding plans, her mother's funeral services and condolence notes, as well as emails on family vacations, yoga routines, and other items one would typically find in their own email account, such as offers from retailers, spam, etc.

Did Clinton delete any emails while facing a subpoena?

No. As noted, the emails that Clinton chose not to keep were personal emailsÃ¢ÂÂthey were not federal records or even work-relatedÃ¢ÂÂand therefore were not subject to any preservation obligation under the Federal Records Act or any request. Nor would they have been subject to the subpoenaÃ¢ÂÂwhich did not exist at the timeÃ¢ÂÂthat was issued by the Benghazi Select Committee some three months later.

Rep. Gowdy's subpoena issued in March 2015 did not seek, and had nothing to do with, her personal, non-work emails nor her server nor the request by State Department last year for her help in their own record-keeping. Indeed in his March 19th letter, Rep. Gowdy expressly stated he was not seeking any emails that were ""purely personal in nature.""

In March 2015, when Rep. Gowdy issued a subpoena to Clinton, the State Department had received all of Clinton's work-related emails in response to their 2014 request, and indeed, had already provided Clinton's relevant emails to Rep. GowdyÃ¢ÂÂs committee.

Rep. Gowdy, other Republicans, and some members of the media have seized on a CNN interview with Clinton to question her on this point. Rep. Gowdy has even gone so far as to say Clinton is lying. But he and the others are clearly mistaken.

As Vox reported, ""[S]he didn't lie about the subpoena. Ã¢ÂÂ¦ Clinton clearly wasn't responding to the question of whether she'd ever been subpoenaed by the Benghazi Committee but whether she'd been subpoenaed before she wiped the emails from her server."" Additionally, Factcheck.org said in its analysis, ""Clinton's denial came in response to a question about deleting emails 'while facing a subpoena,' and Clinton objected to Keilar's 'assumption.' ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs campaign said that the emails were deleted before she received the subpoena and that was the point Clinton was making."" Politifact added, ""Suggesting that Clinton deleted emails while facing a subpoena contradicts what we know about the controversy so far.""

Vox went on to further decry Rep. Gowdy's reaction, saying, ""[T]his one's a particularly absurd gimmick, even for a committee that is selectively leaking from depositions and documents to justify its existence. If there was a more extreme category of dissembling than 'pants on fire,' now would be the time for Politifact to roll it out on the House Republicans.""

Why was the State Department given printed copies?

That is the requirement. The instructions regarding electronic mail in the Foreign Affairs Manual (the Department's policy manual) require that ""until technology allowing archival capabilities for long-term electronic storage and retrieval of email messages is available and installed, those messages warranting preservation as records (for periods longer than current E-mail systems routinely maintain them) must be printed out and filed with related records."" [5 FAM 443.3].

Were any work items deleted in the course of producing the printed copies?

No.

How many emails were in her account? And how many of those were provided to the State Department?

Her email account contained a total of 62,320 sent and received emails from March 2009 to February 2013. Based on the review process described below, 30,490 of these emails were provided to the Department, and the remaining 31,830 were private, personal records.

How and who decided what should be provided to the State Department?

The Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance ""designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials."" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].

Following conversations with State Department officials and in response to the State Department's 2014 letter to former Secretaries, Clinton directed her attorneys to assist by identifying and preserving all emails that could potentially be federal records. This entailed a multi-step process to review each email and provide printed copies of Clinton's emails to the State Department, erring on the side of including anything that might be even potentially work-related.

A search was conducted on Clinton's email account for all emails sent and received from 2009 to her last day in office, February 1, 2013.

After this universe was determined, a search was conducted for a "".gov"" (not just state.gov) in any address field in an email. This produced over 27,500 emails, representing more than 90% of the 30,490 printed copies that were provided to the State Department.

To help identify any potential non-"".gov"" correspondence that should be included, a search of first and last names of more than 100 State Department and other U.S. government officials was performed. This included all Deputy Secretaries, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Ambassadors-at-Large, Special Representatives and Envoys, members of the Secretary's Foreign Policy Advisory Board, and other senior officials to the Secretary, including close aides and staff.

Next, to account for non-obvious or non-recognizable email addresses or misspellings or other idiosyncrasies, the emails were sorted and reviewed both by sender and recipient.

Lastly, a number of terms were specifically searched for, including: ""Benghazi"" and ""Libya.""

These additional three steps yielded just over another 2,900 emails, including emails from former Administration officials and long-time friends that may not be deemed by the State Department to be federal records. And hundreds of these emails actually had already been forwarded onto the state.gov system and captured in real-time.

With respect to materials that the Select Committee has requested, the State Department has stated that just under 300 emails related to Libya were provided by the State Department to the Select Committee in response to a November 2014 letter, which contained a broader request for materials than prior requests from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Given Clinton's practice of emailing State Department officials on their state.gov addresses, the State Department already had, and had already provided, the Select Committee with emails from Clinton in August 2014 Ã¢ÂÂ prior to requesting and receiving printed copies of her emails.

The review process described above confirmed Clinton's practice of emailing State Department officials on their .gov address, with the vast majority of the printed copies of work-related emails Clinton provided to the State Department simply duplicating what was already captured in the State Department's record-keeping system in real time.

Did Clinton use this account to communicate with foreign officials?

During her time at State, she communicated with foreign officials in person, through correspondence, and by telephone. The review of all of her emails revealed only one email with a foreign (UK) official.

Did she withhold any work emails? What about the 15 emails that Sid Blumenthal provided to the Select Committee that she did not provide to the State Department?

She provided the State Department with all work and potentially work-related emails that she had, including all of her correspondence with Sid Blumenthal. We understand that Mr. Blumenthal had some emails that Clinton did not have, and Clinton had some emails that Mr. Blumenthal did not have, but it is important to note that none of those emails provide any new insights on the attack on our facilities in Benghazi.

Do you think a third party should have been allowed to review what was turned over to the State Department, as well as the remainder that was not?

The Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official, not the agency or a third party, to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance ""designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials."" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].

Clinton responded to the State Department's request by providing approximately 55,000 pages of her work and potentially work-related emails. She has also taken the unprecedented step of asking that those emails be made public. In doing so, she has sought to support the State Department's efforts, fulfill her responsibility of record-keeping, and provide the chance for the public to assess the work she and officials at the State Department did during her tenure.

After her work-related emails were identified and preserved, Clinton chose not to keep her private, personal emails that were not federal records, including emails about her daughter's wedding plans, her mother's funeral service, family vacations, etc.

Government officials are granted the privacy of their personal, non-work related emails, including personal emails on .gov accounts. Clinton exercised her privilege to ensure the continued privacy of her personal, non-work related emails.

Can't she release the emails she provided to the State Department herself?

Because the printed copies of work-related emails she provided to the State Department include federal records of the Department, the Department needs to review these emails before they can be made public. She called for them to be made available as soon as possible, and is glad to see the Department has begun releasing them.

Some of the emails released show Clinton emailed aides at times on their personal, rather than .gov accounts. Was she trying to hide these communications?

As Clinton has said before, it was her practice to email U.S. government officials on their .gov accounts if it was work-related. This is evidenced in the emails released so far. In reviewing her emails in 2014, there was a fraction of emails with work-related information sent to U.S. government officialsÃ¢ÂÂ personal accounts, and those were provided to the State Department. The overwhelming majority of her work-related emails were to .gov accounts.

Where was the server for her email located?

The server for her email was physically located on her property, which is protected by U.S. Secret Service.

What level of encryption was employed? Who was the service provider?

The security and integrity of her family's electronic communications was taken seriously from the onset when it was first set up for President Clinton's team. While the curiosity about the specifics of this set up is understandable, given what people with ill intentions can do with such information in this day and age, there are concerns about broadcasting specific technical details about past and current practices. Suffice it to say, robust protections were put in place and additional upgrades and techniques employed over time as they became available, including consulting and employing third party experts.

Was the server ever hacked?

No, there is no evidence there was ever a breach.

Was there ever an unauthorized intrusion into her email or did anyone else have access to it?

No.

What was done after her email was exposed in February 2013 after the hacker known as ""Guccifer"" hacked Sid BlumenthalÃ¢ÂÂs account?

While this was not a breach of Clinton's account, because her email address was exposed, steps were taken at that time to ensure the security and integrity of her electronic communications, including changing her email address.

Was the State Department able to respond to requests related to FOIA or Congressional requests before they received printed copies of her work-related emails?

Yes. As the Select Committee has said, the State Department provided the Committee with relevant emails it already had on the state.gov system before the State Department requested any printed copies from former Secretaries, and four months before the State Department received the printed copies.

For example, in the well-publicized hack of Sid Blumenthal's email account, a note he sent Clinton on September 12, 2012, was posted online. At first blush, one might not think this exchange would be captured on the state.gov system. But in fact, Clinton forwarded the email, that very same day, onto the state.gov system. And the email was produced by the State Department to the Select Committee, and acknowledged by the Select Committee, in August 2014.

This example illustrates: 1) when an email from a non-"".gov"" sender had some connection to work or might add to the understanding of State Department officials, it was ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs practice to forward it to officials at their ""state.gov"" address; and 2) the State Department was able to search and produce ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs emails when needed long before, and unrelated to, receiving the printed copies as they were already captured on state.gov accounts."	0
92	"Clinton said, ""Trump Management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law.""

The government in 1973 accused Trump, his father and Trump Management of violating the Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The case alleged TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs realty company discriminated against non-white tenants and potential tenants at numerous apartment complexes.

The government settled the lawsuit, after Trump waged a years-long legal battle, so Trump never admitted guilt. But the company did agree to comply with extensive requirements intended to stop housing discrimination at its properties.

ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs claim is carefully phrased. For that, we rate her claim True."	0

In part five of the second democratic primary debate, things get personal as the candidates touch on the Black Lives Matter movement, Hillary Clinton's email scandal and Bernie Sanders' ability to win over conservatives

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earned laughter and applause during Saturday's Democratic debate for a line defending his progressive tax policy.

When asked how he would pay for proposals like tuition-free college for Americans, Sanders said he would finance them by ""due-demanding: that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations - have gotten away with murder for years - start paying their fair share.""

CBS News Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes pressed the White House hopeful: ""Let's get specific. How high would you go? You've said before you'd go above 50 percent. How high?""

""We haven't come up with an exact number yet,"" Sanders responded. ""But it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower which was 90 percent.""

As an aside, he said, to loud cheers in the audience: ""I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.""

Sanders went on to say that his administration would ""end the absurdities as Warren Buffet often reminds us - that billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses, or truck drivers that makes no sense at all. There has to be real tax reform and the wealthiest and the large corporations will pay when I'm president.""

In fact, during the first term of Republican President Eisenhower, the marginal tax rate on regular income for those earning over $400,000 -- at the time, the highest income bracket -- was 92 percent. The tax rate was carried over from Democratic President Harry Truman's administration. This was the second-highest tax rate during the 20th century, following the 94 percent instituted by President Roosevelt during World War II for those making over $200,000 annually.

In 1954, under Eisenhower, the rate for the highest income bracket decreased to 91 percent.

Taking into account these income tax rates, Sanders' assertion that he's not as ""socialist"" as Eisenhower's administration is correct: Sanders has said before that he doesn't believe his tax policy would tax the top bracket over 90 percent, though he has yet to offer up an exact number.

Appearing on ""CBS This Morning"" in September, Sanders said ""We are going to ask the wealthiest people in this country who are doing phenomenally well, and many large corporations that are making billions of dollars of profits and not paying a nickel in taxes, to in fact start paying their fair share of taxes.""

When asked to specify, the Vermont senator said of taxing those in the highest income bracket, ""I don't think you have to go up to 90 percent.""

Sanders, however, has also called for greater increases in capital gains taxes, which were capped at 25 percent during most of Eisenhower's tenure.

During Saturday's debate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley also defended asking the wealthy to pay a higher share of taxes.

""Under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent,"" he pointed out.

O'Malley is also correct on this point: Under President Reagan, those with annual incomes over $215,400 were taxed at a rate of 69.1 percent."	0

When it comes to electing their next president, Americans want a candidate to vote for Ã¢ÂÂ not just someone to vote against.

American voters want the perspective of an outsider who can bring an entrepreneurial perspective to the White House. They arenÃ¢ÂÂt opposed to experience in governing Ã¢ÂÂ so long as it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt bring with it an addiction to crony capitalism and the fruits thereof.

And they want a candidate who looks after American interests and doesnÃ¢ÂÂt use war to destabilize already volatile regions of the world like the Middle East.

IÃ¢ÂÂm running for President to offer that alternative. I am a successful businessman, and grew my construction business to employ more than 1,000 workers.

I was the Republican governor of the heavily Democratic state of New Mexico. I focused on good government and I got it done Ã¢ÂÂ just like my running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld. The people of New Mexico reelected me by a comfortable margin. Ditto for Weld.

Think of it this way: IÃ¢ÂÂm someone you would trust to run your household and to keep it safe while you went away on a trip or a vacation. I could even fix a few things around the house. After all, the construction company I founded began as a one-man handy-man operation. Can you say the same for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?

IÃ¢ÂÂve balanced budgets and cut taxes. IÃ¢ÂÂve also spoken my mind about where the country needed to go on personal freedoms and marriage equality. In 1999, I became the only sitting governor to publicly advocate the legalization of marijuana. Senator Bernie Sanders came to that viewpoint Ã¢ÂÂ a position that most Americans support Ã¢ÂÂ 16 years later.

IÃ¢ÂÂm also a strong believer in our Constitutional rights to civil liberties and privacy. Our government should not be spying on the electronic communications of American citizens. Nor should our iPhones or Android devices be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures.

And I understand that, as a nation and as a society, we have unfinished business to right the wrongs of injustice suffered by minorities. Blacks are 30 percent more likely that white to be apprehended by the police; they are three times more likely to be searched; they are arrested twice as often as whites; and they are 75 percent more likely to be charged with offenses carrying mandatory minimum sentences.

It is not surprising that there is tangible mistrust, tension and frustration between the police and African-Americans, particularly black males. We need to speak honestly about these issues in order to address them. LetÃ¢ÂÂs be honest. We have healing to do.

One of the biggest concerns that many voters have with both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, but particularly with Ms. Clinton, is the sense that she uses government power to advance her personal and political interests.

She is the very status quo. Americans want that changed. She talks about progressivism, but lines her bank accounts with speaking fees from banks and special interests. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what crony capitalism is all about. Americans recognize pay-to-play when they see it, and they are really, really weary of it.

Having been governor of New Mexico, I know that legislation gets passed to benefit those who have money and influence. Then they buy more money and influence. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs one reason why, as governor, I vetoed more than 750 bills and thousands of line items.

I did it to keep crony capitalism away from government.

Another big difference between Hillary Clinton and myself is that IÃ¢ÂÂm for our national tradition of peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations Ã¢ÂÂ while being extremely skeptical of committing ourselves and our armed forces to foreign conflicts.

As a Senator, she endorsed ill-advised foreign interventions. As Secretary of State, she was the architect of tragic and counter-productive policies in Libya, in Egypt and in Syria. These should not be AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs wars, and we ought not be prompting regime changes that serve only to replace bad actors with even worse actors and instability that makes us less safe.

Instead, our nation need the confidence that its president will be predictable, yes, but also skeptical of engaging in international shenanigans all around the world.

Americans can find sanity and principle by voting Johnson/Weld in 2016."	0

Section 1.

In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.

Section 2.

Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.

Section 3.

Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President.

Section 4.

Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.

Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office."	0

WASHINGTON, D.C. Ã¢ÂÂ

President Obama has ordered a $200,000, life-sized, bronze statue of himself, with plans to install it in the entryway of the White House. The president says that his legacy Ã¢ÂÂshould not be diminished,Ã¢ÂÂ and that this is the only way he can Ã¢ÂÂkeep an eyeÃ¢ÂÂ over Trump, as well as future presidents.

Ã¢ÂÂI have been president for only eight years, and in that time, I have done what no other presidents could do in all their time in total,Ã¢ÂÂ said Obama. Ã¢ÂÂI have created a legacy that should not be diminished. I have created something that no future president will be able to do. In that regard, I have commissioned this statute, with plans to have it permanently erected in the entryway of the White House, so that all who enter can remember me fondly.Ã¢ÂÂ

The statue will not be allowed to be removed, as every president is allowed to leave one thing in the White House that must never be touched by future presidents. William Howard Taft left his giant bathtub. Bill Clinton left one of his saxophones. George W. Bush left a piece of mirror and a rolled up hundred.

So, I wanted to make a few corrections:

Bill says: Hillary never wanted to run for public office, but she did want to work at public service.

The true facts are: When Clinton was considering not running for another term as Governor of Arkansas in 1990, Hillary said she would run if he didn't. She and Bill even had me take two surveys to assess her chances of winning. The conclusion was that she couldn't win because people would just see her as a seat warmer for when Bill came back licking his wounds after losing for president. So she didn't run. Bill did and won. But there is no question she had her eye on public office, as opposed to service, long ago.



Bill says: In law school Hillary worked on legal services for the poor.

The true facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent. She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.



Bill says: Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a children's rights project for poor kids.



The true facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.



Bill says: Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers.



The true facts are: She flunked the DC bar exam and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She only joined the prestigious Rose Law Firm after Bill became Attorney General and made partner only after he was elected Governor.



Bill says: President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its Chairman.



The true facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman.



Bill says: She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital.

The true facts are: Yes she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Wal-Mart board of directors, for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices.



Bill says: Hillary didn't succeed at getting health care for all Americans in 1994 but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance.



The true facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Bill Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I helped to negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.



Bill says: Hillary was the face of America all over the world.



The true facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House. Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic, and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.



Bill says: Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for children's and women's issues.



The true facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation. One set up a national park in Puerto Rico. A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 9-11 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire NY delegation.



Here is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton. She has done everything possible to weaken the President and our country when it comes to the war on terror:



1. She wants to close GITMO & move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system.

2. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to/from the USA.

3. She wants to grants constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield.



4. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells & supporters in the USA.

5. She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the military & CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.I can't think of a single bill Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our country in the War on Terror. But, I can think of a lot of comments she has made that weakens our country and makes it a more dangerous situation for all of us........She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned. She is a disaster for all Americans."	0

Half Of The Proposed Kerry-McCain '04 Ticket Campaigns In Boston

ABC's Charles Gibson: ""But, let me, let me, let me imagine it. If he asked you, if he came across the aisle and asked you, would you even entertain the idea? Or will you rule it out for good and all and ever right now?""

Kerry-McCain 2004? Sen. John Kerry Says Sen. McCain Wanted It:



Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) Says That Sen. John McCain Approached him About Being His 2004 Running Mate. FOX NEWS' BRIT HUME: ""The struggling presidential campaign of John McCain is now involved in a controversy with John Kerry over who approached whom about a possible McCain spot on the Democratic ticket in 2004. The Politico newspaper reports Kerry maintains that McCain's people made overtures to him about a vice presidential nod. But McCain says no, it was Kerry's idea, and that he rejected it each time it was raised. This of course, follows a similar story that came out last week in which Senate Democrats where saying McCain was in serious negotiations with them about switching parties following his loss to George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential primaries. McCain says that also is a mischaracterization, and that he was never serious about leaving the Republican Party.""

SEN. JOHN KERRY: ""I don't know all the details of it. I know that Tom, from a conversation with him, was in conversation with a number of Republicans back then. It doesn't surprise me completely because his people similarly approached me to engage in a discussion about his potentially being on the ticket as Vice President.

103	"Obama Demands Investigation into Subprime Loan Discrimination

Thursday, October 18, 2007

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CONTACT: Amy Brundage, 202 228 5511

Asks FTC to examine whether minority homeowners are being targeted with high-priced loans

WASHINGTON, D.C. Ã¢ÂÂ U.S. Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) today sent the following letter to FTC Commissioner Deborah Platt Majoras, calling on her to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine whether minority borrowers have been victims of discrimination. According to recent studies, and an editorial in the New York Times, there is increasing evidence that black and Hispanic borrowers were more likely to be steered to high-cost subprime loans than other borrowers. Hundreds of thousands of African American families Ã¢ÂÂ many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans Ã¢ÂÂ could potentially lose their homes in the coming years.

In the letter, Obama requests that the FTC investigate whether there is evidence that lenders or brokers target poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products, whether lenders are engaging in deceptive marketing practices, and whether the lack of lower-cost borrowing options has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers.

The text of the letter is below:

October 18, 2007



The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras

Federal Trade Commission

600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,

Washington, D.C. 20580



Dear Commissioner Majoras:

I am writing to bring to your attention the attached editorial from yesterday's New York Times which begins: ""Evidence is mounting that during the housing boom, black and Hispanic borrowers were far more likely to be steered into high-cost subprime loans than other borrowers, even after controlling for factors such as income, loan size and property location."" (""Subprime in Black and White,"" The New York Times, October 17, 2007)

In reality, such evidence has been mounting since the 1990s when the Clinton Administration found that subprime loans in 1998 were over four times more prevalent in predominantly black neighborhoods in New York than in predominantly white neighborhoods. More recent studies have found similar examples of potentially discriminatory lending patterns.

Last year, for example, the Center for Responsible Lending found that for most types of subprime home loans, minority borrowers are more likely to pay higher rates than white borrowers even after accounting for differences in credit scores, loan to value ratios, and other underwriting criteria. And just this week another analysis confirmed that even high-income black borrowers are more likely than comparable white borrowers to have risky and costly subprime loans.

Black families are paying more for home loans than similarly situated white families. Effective action to address this disparity is long overdue. I call upon the FTC to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine if minority borrowers have been the victims of discrimination.

Among other things, the Federal Trade Commission is charged with protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive marketing acts or practices. Many subprime loans include sales practices or loan features that are potentially unfair and deceptive for borrowers. Some practices, such as yield-spread premiums, which encourage mortgage brokers to steer borrowers into the most costly products, or prepayment penalties, which enable lenders to offer mortgages that are unsupported by sound underwriting principles, appear to be the source of significant problems faced by many subprime borrowers.

With an estimated 53% of African American borrowers in 2005 receiving subprime loans, and more than 60% of subprime loans containing prepayment penalties, the risks particularly for African American homeowners are substantial. Indeed, hundreds of thousands of African American families Ã¢ÂÂ many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans Ã¢ÂÂ are expected to face loss of their homes in the coming years.

I request that you begin a thorough investigation within five days and provide a status report to my office within 15 days on the following questions:

1) Whether there is evidence of lenders or brokers specifically targeting poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products than would otherwise be justified based on legitimate underwriting criteria.

2) Whether the marketing of lending products to poor or minority borrowers has been deceptive or unfair. Specifically, whether the disclosure of yield-spread premiums and prepayment penalties has been sufficiently transparent to borrowers and whether such or similar sales and pricing practices have been disproportionately detrimental to minority borrowers.



3) Whether the lack of lower-cost borrowing options, including those regulated by the Federal government, in predominantly minority communities even for higher-income borrowers, has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers in their efforts to realize the dream of affordable home ownership and wealth building.



Thank you for your assistance protecting all consumers from the pernicious affects of predatory and discriminatory lending practices which undermine the American dream.



Sincerely,



Barack Obama

United States Senator

104	"""Some of the hardest-working and most productive people in this city are undocumented aliens,"" Mr. Giuliani said. ""If you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status, you're one of the people who we want in this city. You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair.""

The politics of immigration is different in New York. Immigration and burden are two words that do not appear often -- or without raising a furor -- in the same sentence. Whatever their legal status, immigrants are considered a fact of life, a point of pride and an integral part of New York City's identity. Many New Yorkers know well that their own forebears arrived without papers.

""So many of the Irish, so many of the Italians who came when my parents came, were technically illegal,"" Mr. Cuomo said.

Because of New York City's size, new immigrants are absorbed without as much fuss as elsewhere. Often, they are responsible for revitalizing dying neighborhoods -- like Crown Heights in Brooklyn and Flushing, Queens -- and New Yorkers know it.

Illegal immigrants in New York City confound the national stereotype of a young Mexican man sneaking across the border. Italians are the largest group, followed by Ecuadoreans, Poles, Dominicans and Trinidadians. European, Caribbean, Latin American and Asian, they blend into the city without radically altering its racial and ethnic makeup. So the racism that often compounds anti-immigrant sentiment is not as stark in New York."	0

I mean, it really is, that John Boehner could not get a majority of his own caucus to support what had become the Republican position, endorsed not simply by him, but by Republican Whip Kevin McCarthy and Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

And it's a real problem. I think it puts at risk Boehner's own leadership and his ability to deliver Republicans. It weakens the bargaining position for Republicans in the final negotiations. But I don't know how much closer we are, because I think it strengthens the liberals in the Democratic Caucus, which is going to make it tougher for the Republicans to accept it, because a weakened Republican means a strengthened, emboldened Democratic liberal group.

And I just think that there's too many moving parts at this point to say, this is what is going to happen.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you -- what do you -- can it get done, Michael? I mean, it's. . .

MICHAEL GERSON: Well, I generally agree with Mark.

And today was supposed to be the end of the world. I think it feels like it for Boehner. This is a case where he ended up with 40 to 50 members of his caucus that wouldn't support anything on this.

MICHAEL GERSON: And they were to the right of Grover Norquist. Norquist was open to the Plan B.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Because he had endorsed Plan B.

MICHAEL GERSON: Right, exactly. So, they want to go off the cliff flags flying. It marginalized Boehner and the Republicans in future negotiations, and raised a question of whether anyone can get a governing majority in the House of Representatives when it comes to the budget.

Those are really serious matters. Now, it does go to the Senate, where Harry Reid and McConnell can try to come to some, you know, functional surrender for Republicans on rates, and kick the can on a lot of other issues, and see if that can pass in the next 10 days.

But that still would pass -- have to pass the House. And so I think the chances of backing off, off the cliff are higher than they ever have been.

JUDY WOODRUFF: You know, I listened to some of these recalcitrant House Republicans today, Mark. And they were saying, I was not going to vote for a tax increase, when my constituents would never have gone along with that.

MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think there's two realities, here, Judy.

First of all, there's a lot of Republicans, and more than a few Democrats, who are terrified of one thing. That's being primaried, a primary opponent who is going to run on your right if you are a Republican, on your left if you are a Democrat. But it's really become a problem for Republicans, because this has been an article of faith that -- said before it is since 1990 that any Republican in the House or the Senate has voted for a tax increase on Capitol Hill, any Republican.

Now, of the 241 Republicans now in the House, 212 of them have come to the Congress since 1990. So, they have never voted for a tax increase. They don't know anybody who has voted for a tax increase. And they were being asked to vote for a tax increase for a tactical advantage on a piece of legislation that they knew the president, A., would veto, B., wouldn't pass the Senate.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Only on people earning over a million.

MARK SHIELDS: A million dollars, but they were going to give up their virginity, their political virginity, and risk a primary challenge -- that is how they saw it -- by doing this.

What they failed to address is the reality that, when you are the -- part of the governing party in any institution, the House, the Senate, anyplace else, you have a responsibility to make sure that you can govern. And what they did was, they robbed the Republicans, that 40 to 50. They robbed the Republicans of that -- that sense of leadership, of governability, and robbed them, I think, and reduced the brand of the Republican Party even more.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it a fundamental disagreement over what governing is?

MICHAEL GERSON: Yes, I think that that is part of it.

I think what they couldn't answer is how they are going to get a better result. . .

MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

MICHAEL GERSON: . . . after you -- when you go over the cliff, or later on in these negotiations, because they're not. This actually undermines their negotiating power and position, which -- because it is a foolish position to be in.

But it does -- it raises some really big issues. I mean, one of them here is that we now have a president and a speaker who both wanted a deal, OK? By every account, they wanted a deal. They tried it twice. And they couldn't make it happen.

Now, they -- and I don't think they can make it happen. It's a serious kind of governing challenge right now. If you look, we have got a short-term political crisis. We have a long-term fiscal crisis. And we're providing no confidence whatsoever that we can approach those things as a government in a mature way.

We look increasingly like we have the dysfunction, the governmental dysfunction of Europe, without the excuse of being separate countries. And, you know, I think it's a serious challenge to America's standing in the world, that -- the views of credit markets. And Washington is not taking that yet with sufficiency seriously -- seriousness.

MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

I would just add, and not in a partisan way, but the 213 -- 215-209 vote last night in the House before the whole thing came apart, which was that -- to not take the sequestration funds out of defense, but to take them out of domestic spending, was a party-line vote; 209 Democrats stuck on that. Not a single one broke.

And I think -- I think you are seeing far more unity in the Democratic ranks than you are in the Republican ranks right now. I agree it is a governmental problem. If the whole thing comes to a grinding halt and we see it reflected in the financial markets and the stock market and elsewhere, then it's a governmental problem. It's not simply a Democratic advantage, a Republican advantage.

But, right now, the real fault lines are in the Republican Caucus.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we don't -- sounds like neither one -- none of us knows where this is headed.

So let's move to another subject.

Michael, the president today named John Kerry to be secretary of state. It had been widely believed he wanted to choose the U.N. ambassador, Susan Rice.

John Kerry -- what do you make of the choice?

MICHAEL GERSON: Well, it's a -- I think, a safe choice and a good choice. I mean, this is a man who has had three decades on the Foreign Relations Committee, former presidential candidate, would have immediate standing on the global stage, similar to Hillary Clinton, in this kind of job.

He's also been a troubleshooter for the president in some key ways, under the radar screen. When South Sudan was separating from the North, and it looked like those negotiations were breaking down, Kerry came in and really made a difference there. So, I think that, I mean, he looks good after the Rice nomination. He is a less controversial nominee.

He has a lot of respect among his colleagues in the Senate. And so I think that the president -- you know, it was not -- not particularly a hard choice.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark?

MARK SHIELDS: I think James Mann and David Ignatius put it very well, I mean, that he is -- he is experienced, probably unmatched in experience. He does bring considerable stature, on a first-name basis with many of the people around the world with whom he will be dealing. He has done, as David pointed out, back-channel missions for the president, whether it's dealing with Hamas, Afghanistan, Pakistan.

And he is eminently confirmable. That's in the Senate. There is no question about it. And it opens up a possibility of a Republican seat in Massachusetts. So, Republicans are cheered by that.

(LAUGHTER)

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, just quickly, before we leave that, there was a -- and this -- we heard this mentioned earlier, that some -- there is still conversation about whether the president is going to name, may name Chuck Hagel, former Republican senator, to be secretary of defense.

A lot of criticism has risen up. Outside groups are saying they are going to defeat him if he's named. What is going on there?

MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

Well, I mean, certainly, Chuck Hagel has been subjected to withering criticism for his lack of constant or at least unswerving support of every Israeli administration. That has been a central part. There are people who have personal issues with Chuck Hagel.

I personally think, A., he's close to the president. He was close to the president when the president was in the Senate. And I think he brings to it credentials that are sadly lacking in this administration. I mean, this is somebody who has spilled blood, shed blood for his own country, spilled blood for his country, faced combat, chose to go to Vietnam.

He had orders to go to Germany as an enlisted man. He insisted on going to Vietnam, where he faced serious combat. I just think -- I think he brings to it the first Vietnam veteran to be secretary of defense and the only enlisted man ever to be Secretary of Defense. I think those are credentials that are needed.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Any thoughts on that?

MICHAEL GERSON: I think that, sometimes, people say these trial balloons are a sign of presidential weakness if they don't go up.

They're not really. They're actually a smart way for a president to gauge this. I think the opposition to Hagel is growing. I think it is rooted in disagreements, not just about Israel, but about defense cuts, but about his views on Iran, which are significantly to the left of president, and because he has -- he doesn't have a lot of respect of former colleagues here, which are already coming out, and many of them in opposition.

I think it's an unlikely nomination.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn you both to the gun control discussion.

We heard from the head of the NRA, Mark, today, Wayne LaPierre, who is advocating putting an armed guard in every school. The president has launched a task force this week. Where do you see this headed?

MARK SHIELDS: I mean, to call Wayne LaPierre and the NRA have a tin ear, I think is an understatement. I mean, they seem to be almost whining about criticism of their position, that it somehow was rooted in the press bias or elected officials who have gun-free school zones.

You know, Judy, the reality is -- and it's a terrible reality -- since Robert Kennedy died in the Ambassador Hotel on June 4, 1968, more Americans have died from gunfire than died in all the -- all the wars, all the wars of this country's history, from the Revolutionary through the Civil War, World War I, World War II, in those 43 years.

We have half the guns that are in the world are in the United States. I mean, guns are a problem. And I think they still have to be confronted.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Something like 280 million guns.

MICHAEL GERSON: Yes. And we're not going to get rid of all those guns. That's not going to happen. The question is. . .

MARK SHIELDS: Well, we could do -- we could do Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and tax ammunition.

MICHAEL GERSON: Well, yes.

I think that there -- but there are a series of reasonable measures we could take, even going back to what we were doing in the 1990s, when it comes to ammunition, and magazine size, and assault -- certain types of semiautomatic weapons.

You should be able to make that case. We have swung so far in this debate in the libertarian direction, that those are fairly minimal burdens on anyone's rights when it comes to this that might have a marginal positive in fact -- impact on gun violence.

But any solution is also going have to deal with mental health issues. Security in schools, I don't think it's practical to put armed people in tens of thousands of schools. But security in schools, as well as reasonable gun controls, we're going to have to do a bunch of things in this area.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Sobering topic, and we will be coming back to it.

Michael Gerson, Mark Shields, thank you both.

MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy. Thank you.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And Merry Christmas.

MICHAEL GERSON: Merry Christmas.

MARK SHIELDS: Merry Christmas to you. Thank you."	0

109	"Donald Trump took a major step toward securing the Republican presidential nomination following the mogulÃ¢ÂÂs Super Tuesday victory, and faced with the prospect of a President Trump, Miley Cyrus turned to Instagram Tuesday to tell her 38.1 million followers, Ã¢ÂÂDonald Trump is a fucking nightmare!Ã¢ÂÂ

Cyrus wrote the caption next to a publicity photo of Trump; CyrusÃ¢ÂÂ Instagram burn has gained 239,000 likes since it was posted Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Dead Petz singer continued lobbying against the GOP frontrunner with a photo of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs delegate totals over Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and a caption where Cyrus playfully threatened to move out of the country if Trump is elected and a hashtag #aintapartyindausaanymo.

CyrusÃ¢ÂÂ Instagram then took aim at self-proclaimed Ã¢ÂÂmost hated woman in the worldÃ¢ÂÂ Rebecca Francis, a woman who uses her social media to showcase her hunting prowess, and the hunterÃ¢ÂÂs allegiance to Trump.

Cyrus isnÃ¢ÂÂt the only artist to lament a possible future with Trump as commander in chief: Red Hot Chili PeppersÃ¢ÂÂ Flea recently told Rolling Stone, Ã¢ÂÂI canÃ¢ÂÂt take Donald Trump or anything he says seriously. I just think that heÃ¢ÂÂs a silly reality-show bozo and blustering guy who likes getting attention. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think he wants to be president, and I donÃ¢ÂÂt think he has a chance to be the president. HeÃ¢ÂÂs just some egotistical, silly person whose main concern in life is getting a blowjob. He wants to be on TV and he wants everyone to thinks heÃ¢ÂÂs important.Ã¢ÂÂ"	1
110	"JUDY WOODRUFF: We come back now to the gun story.

And we're joined by David Keene. He's president of the National Rifle Association.

Welcome to the NewsHour.

DAVID KEENE, National Rifle Association: Thank you for having me.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, earlier on the program, we heard from the governor of Delaware, Jack Markell, who said the critics who argue that what they're trying to do by limiting gun violence and say that it's an attack on the Second Amendment are not right. He said, what we're simply doing are commonsense safety measures.

DAVID KEENE: That's what Michael Bloomberg says.

No, it is an attack on the Second Amendment. It is an attack on those Americans who purchased and legally use firearms, who have never committed a criminal act, who have never done anything wrong. And they can say that it doesn't infringe upon their rights, but, in fact, it does.

Now, every amendment -- the First Amendment -- you can't, famously, yell fire in a crowded theater. The Second Amendment is also subject to reasonable limits. The Supreme Court has held that. But they're strictly looked at.

And you have to demonstrate that they really impact things and that they're really necessary. And the problem that we have is that none of the things that they have suggested are going to do any good. They're asking the question, Judy, what do we do about guns? The question should be, what do we do to prevent the kinds of things that happened in Connecticut?

And we don't think that they're asking that question, but they're pursuing their own agenda.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, they say that's what they're doing.

DAVID KEENE: I know they do.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And let me just quickly read from something that Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman who was gravely wounded. Mark Kelly, her husband.

They wrote an op-ed article just a few days ago. They say, people who are just -- he said: ""Special interests have cast -- have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties.""

And they say, as a result, more people are vulnerable to gun violence.

DAVID KEENE: You know, they're talking about what they call assault weapons. Actually, an assault weapon, so-called, wasn't involved in the Giffords shooting.

But the fact of the matter is that we have heard time and time again that these are military weapons designed for the battlefield. They're not. They're semiautomatic commercial rifles. The AR-15 is the bestselling long gun in the United States. There are over three million of them that have been purchased by people.

Most people that have them use them for sport shooting, for hunting and for the like. And to take those guns away from them for no reason is an infringement on their rights.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the mother of one of the victims in Aurora, Colo., was visiting Newtown just yesterday, and she specifically talked about the AR-15, these assault weapons.

And she said, they don't belong in the hands of people in the community. What do you say to what -- her name is...

JUDY WOODRUFF: ... Phillips.

DAVID KEENE: It was interesting, Judy, because...

JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you say to her?

DAVID KEENE: ... because we're talking -- anybody who dies in a tragedy, whether it's an auto accident or beaten to death or knifed or killed by a gun, it is tragic. And I can understand her reaction to that.

But, in this country, last year, more people were, in fact, beaten to death than killed by all long arms, including assault, so-called assault weapons. The semiautomatic rifle has been in this country and available to people since 1806.

In our museum, we have got one that fired 20 rounds from a magazine, a magazine that would be banned by some people, that Lewis and Clark took with them on their expedition.

It's been that long. And we're talking -- we're talking about something that has no impact. We have tried to do that as a society before. It hasn't made any difference.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we can argue about the statistics. I mean, what is out there...

DAVID KEENE: Right. People do that.

JUDY WOODRUFF: ... 70 percent of the violent deaths last year were due -- had a gun involved.

But, specifically, David Keene, what about what we're hearing from the president, that there is going to be an attempt to ban the assault weapon, that there will be a proposal for comprehensive background checks? Is there -- where -- is there any common ground between the position of the NRA and the White House?

DAVID KEENE: Yes, there is some common ground.

It's not on banning rifles that we don't think would make any difference. And it's not on setting up a national gun registry.

But we have for 20 years been asking that those people who have been adjudicated to be mentally potentially violent be put on the lists of people who are not allowed to buy firearms.

When you go into a store to buy a gun, or if you go to a gun show to buy a gun from a licensed dealer, they have to check your background. The FBI keep databases of people who are not allowed to buy guns, felons and the like. We have been urging that these people be put on these lists. And nothing has happened.

Twenty-three states don't put any on the list. Now, one of the things we have to do is keep firearms out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. And we can do that partly in that way. The problem is, you can never predict in a society who is going to do what.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

DAVID KEENE: So, you also have to provide security. And that's what we have been proposing in terms of the schools.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's why -- and that's -- and you mentioned mental illness. And that is something the administration is going to talk about.

Maybe there's some common ground there. When it comes to guards, putting armed guards, Gov. Markell said earlier on the program that -- he said, how would you know where to put a guard, how many to put? He said it's really an impractical thing to...

DAVID KEENE: Sure.

Well, I don't think that it's impractical. You know, just by coincidence, I was in Israel the day after the Newtown shooting. And I was touring a facility where they in fact train guards for their schools, because they had a spate of shootings in the 1970s.

Their crazy people are a little different from ours, but the results were the same. And they first used volunteers.

Now each school provides its own through private security guards. And I was a place where they train these people. It works there. It was a sensible thing for them to do.

After Columbine, President Clinton proposed what he called the COPS program. And about 28,000 schools in this country now either have police through that program or police that are paid for by the state or private security guards. Those schools have them.

Now, and it is -- there's an argument -- the argument against it is just what you said. But the fact is, if you look at the people who do this, first of all, they're mentally deranged. And, secondly, they're cowards. And the fact that there's somebody armed there will prevent them in most cases from doing anything.

Can you -- do we live in a perfect world? No. But we can do what makes sense to protect our kids.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of what's not perfect, what about trying some of the solutions that the folks who are saying they're not trying to attack the Second Amendment are saying? They simply want to make -- they want to reduce gun violence.

Why not try reducing high-capacity ammunition clips? Why not try a ban on assault weapons?

DAVID KEENE: Well, we tried a ban on assault weapons. The only thing that is different is -- and, remember, Judy, that an assault weapon has to be listed because there's no functional difference between a so-called assault weapon and any other semiautomatic rifle.

So, this time, they're saying, well, if it has a pistol grip, it's dangerous. If it doesn't have a pistol grip, it isn't dangerous. Now, that's absurd from a functional standpoint, because it's the same gun, the same rifle. And the only difference is cosmetic.

So, banning something for cosmetic reasons is not going to cause -- is not going to cure the problem.

JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're not saying there's -- couldn't reasonable people sit down at the table and come up with a solution that would satisfy you, your organization and would satisfy those who say, we have got to make it safer?

DAVID KEENE: That's why we went to the meeting with Vice President Biden.

But, you know, before that meeting, the vice president himself and those speaking for him said, we're open-minded. We're going to discuss this. We got to the meeting.

And one of the first things he said was, the president and I have strong feelings about firearms, and nobody is going to change our mind on that. We're going to pursue what we want to pursue.

Fine. They had the meeting, so they could say, oh, and we talked to the NRA.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and I happened to talk to someone in the White House, because I had heard you say something similar to that in another interview. And they say that's not what was said in the meeting.

DAVID KEENE: Well, it is.

And the other thing -- let me say one other thing. In the last year, 77,000 people who were on the prohibited list tried to buy firearms. That, in itself, is a crime. You know how many have been prosecuted? Seventy.

When that was raised at the meeting, the attorney general said, well, we don't have the resources and the time to be going after those people. Those people are the potential criminals whom we're trying to keep guns out of the hands of, but the government doesn't have time to do anything about them. They do have time to try and prohibit legitimate citizens from owning firearms.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly, David Keene, the new polls show that are out that show even in gun-owning households people are saying by large percentages we need to do something about, again, high-capacity ammunition clips, assault weapons, background checks?

DAVID KEENE: Well, actually, interestingly, the Gallup poll showed no change at all on the so-called assault weapon question. I consider that evidence of the fact that people are smarter than politicians.

But, given the publicity and everything, I'm surprised that there hasn't been more of an immediate reaction.

But when we get into this, when we begin to discuss it -- and remember it's sort of deja vu, because we have had this discussion before. Once the discussion takes place and people think about the substance of it, I'm confident that the judgment of the American people is going to be as it was before.

And that is that Second Amendment rights should be protected. Criminals should be prosecuted. And we should strengthen the ways we keep guns out of the hands of people who have no business buying them.

JUDY WOODRUFF: David Keene, president of the NRA, we thank you for being with us tonight.

DAVID KEENE: My pleasure, as always. Thank you."	0

Ã¢ÂÂFACT: Donald Trump would force schools to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Hillary Clinton campaign post on Twitter, May 14, 2016 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight One of the nine things the Clinton campaign says Ã¢ÂÂevery voter in America needs to know about Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂ is that he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. Most of the nine items are TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs widely-known ideas (Muslim ban, torture, ISIS, etc.), but his proposal to allow guns in schools is less familiar to the public.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs largely because Trump himself hasnÃ¢ÂÂt talked about it much publicly. His campaign, as usual, didnÃ¢ÂÂt respond to our request for more information, and doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem to have answered other media outletsÃ¢ÂÂ requests, either.

Perhaps Trump is saving the details until his May 20 speech at the National Rifle Association leadership event. (The NRA wants to repeal gun-free zones.) In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances heÃ¢ÂÂs described his plan to see what he intends to do about school gun-free zones.

The Facts

Congress enacted the Gun-Free School Zones Act in 1990, under President George H. W. Bush, as a part of a larger crime bill, in response to school shootings in the 1980s. It was struck down by the Supreme Court because of violations under the Commerce Clause but was reenacted under President Bill Clinton with a list of exceptions supported by the NRA.

The law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states prohibit concealed carry. There is a dispute between gun-rights and gun-control advocates as to whether the law enacted to prevent shootings on school grounds actually motivates people to target schools, since the victims would be unarmed. (We plan to explore this in a future fact-check.)

After the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, states began introducing legislation to arm teachers and staff at K-12 schools. In 2013 alone, at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills to authorize school districts to allow certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2013, more states have considered laws allowing guns on college campuses.

That year, seven bills were signed into law allowing limited concealed carry with a permit at K-12 schools (mostly applicable to private schools). Some states have specific exemptions for guns in school zones with a concealed-carry permit, such as guns carried by security or law enforcement or unloaded firearms locked in a vehicle on school property.

Trump has argued against gun-free zones at military bases since last October, but he has been less vocal about repealing gun-free zones at schools.

Share this article Share

The one time he talked about it publicly was at a January 2016 rally in Vermont: Ã¢ÂÂI will get rid of gun-free zones on schools Ã¢ÂÂ you have to Ã¢ÂÂ and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no more gun-free zones.Ã¢ÂÂ His campaign did not respond to requests by the media to clarify his proposal.

Our colleague Jenna Johnson reported at the time that the proposal Ã¢ÂÂraises a number of questions, such as: Would this apply to all public schools, from elementary to college? How would schools deal with the likely logistical and safety concerns created by having guns on the grounds?Ã¢ÂÂ

Trump was asked similar questions a few weeks later during an interview with the Outdoor Channel. This seems to be one of the only times he was ever asked directly about his proposal: How would you mandate that legislation? By executive order? Since public schools are legislated by the states, how could you make such an order stick? Would this legislation apply just to public schools, or private as well?

TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs answer was still devoid of specifics:

Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm going to get rid of the gun-free zones on the military bases. IÃ¢ÂÂm also going to do it in schools. You say you have a school, and itÃ¢ÂÂs gun-free. The criminals are out there saying, Ã¢ÂÂThis is incredible. This is perfect. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no guns in there. IÃ¢ÂÂm the only one thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to have guns.Ã¢ÂÂ You canÃ¢ÂÂt do it. IÃ¢ÂÂm going to work with the states, and if I have to, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to try and perhaps override the states if I have to, if IÃ¢ÂÂm allowed to do that. . . . But we canÃ¢ÂÂt have gun-free zones where, I see schools advertise, Ã¢ÂÂWe are a gun-free zone.Ã¢ÂÂ And then you have these crazy people out there saying, Ã¢ÂÂBoy, this is the most incredible thing,Ã¢ÂÂ and thatÃ¢ÂÂs happening.Ã¢ÂÂ

The Pinocchio Test

Trump hasnÃ¢ÂÂt offered many details of his proposal, but it is clear that he wants to force states to allow guns in schools. Would he propose that Congress repeal the federal ban? Would it become illegal for states to pass laws to prohibit concealed carry at schools? The specifics arenÃ¢ÂÂt clear yet.

Trump said he would Ã¢ÂÂwork with the statesÃ¢ÂÂ but that he would Ã¢ÂÂoverride the states if I have to.Ã¢ÂÂ Based on what he has said publicly so far, Trump indeed would force schools to allow guns. And he wants to make it happen on his first day as president.

BACKGROUND BRIEFING

BY SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS

ON THE GENERAL MOTORS RESTRUCTURING



May 31, 2009

Via Conference Call

7:10 P.M. EDT



MS. PSAKI: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Just a reminder that the call this evening is on background, and you can attribute quotes to a senior administration official. And the embargo is set for 10:00 p.m. this evening Eastern time. Everyone on this call should also have a fact sheet.

I'm going to turn it over to Robert Gibbs now.

MR. GIBBS: Thanks, everybody, for joining. We're going to do this basically in two parts. The first part, my colleagues will go through the GM specific parts of the call tonight. And then after that we will go through the government ownership principles, which I know a number of you are interested in as part of this and other transactions.

So with that, I'm going to turn it over to my colleague.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, I'll just try to run through this reasonably quickly and maximize the time for questions. Everyone should have a fact sheet. I know you've only had it for a short period of time, so let me run through quickly the main points that we wanted to cover.

Everyone is aware that 60 days ago the President announced that he would give General Motors 60 days in order to design a plan for viability that would achieve lasting and permanent profitability and opportunity for success. And since that time the company has been working diligently in conjunction with the auto task force to implement those principles, including one of the President's main principles which was the concept of shared sacrifice among all of the stakeholders.

And so we are here tonight to give you a preview of the results of this, including what the President will talk about tomorrow. So I'll run through that reasonably quickly.

First, within this concept of shared sacrifice there are several things to talk about -- first, as I said, the auto task force has worked with GM on an operational restructuring that is designed to reduce General Motors break-even point of about 16 million annual rate of car sales down to 10 million annual car sales environment. As many of you undoubtedly know, we're running about 9.5 million car sales at the moment. And so we hope that by reducing this break-even point GM will be able to endure a period of difficult car sales before hopefully we will see a recovery, and this will, of course, allow GM to become profitable at a much lower level of car sales than has been the case before.

Secondly, as you know, the UAW has reached a new agreement with GM and that agreement has been ratified that involves significant concessions by the UAW -- concessions that are in virtually every respect more aggressive than what the previous administration demanded in its loan agreement. And one of the major aspects of that settlement, of that renegotiation, was changes in terms of the VEBA -- employee retirement health care trust in which GM had a $20 billion obligation under its existing -- and I'll talk in a second about what's going to happen with that.

GM is also announcing more or less as we speak that the steering committee has reported that bondholders represent at least 54 percent of GM's unsecured bonds, have agreed to tender their portion of the $27 billion of unsecured debt for a pro rata share of 10 percent of the equity of new GM for -- inaudible -- for an additional 58 percent. And so I think from the standpoint of the U.S. government we are very pleased and gratified to be going into the 363 process that will commence tomorrow with such a strong showing of support from the -- inaudible -- community.

And then GM is also announcing tonight the specifics of its operational restructuring with respect to its plant operations. And we will leave the details of that to them as it is their decisions and their restructuring.

So we are going through, as I think everyone here is aware, a 363 process that we hope and expect will be similar to Chrysler. We do not expect it to be as speedy as Chrysler's because GM is a far larger, far more complicated global company, but we do expect it to proceed, broadly speaking, along similar lines to the Chrysler one, which you all know, has made very good progress and is very close to a successful outcome.

So in the context of that 363, a new company, a new GM, if you will, will be formed to purchase the operating assets out of the old General Motors that will become part of this new company. And left behind in the old company will be liabilities and other miscellaneous assets that are no longer needed as part of the new General Motors that we expect to create.

So as part of that several other things will happen. First, the new GM will establish a new VEBA, a new independent trust. And you will recall that I mentioned the $20 billion obligation that the old General Motors had to VEBA. As part of the shared sacrifice that the President has emphasize, that will be replaced by a $2.5 billion note, $6.5 billion of preferred stock, and 17.5 percent of the equity of new GM -- thus warrants to purchase an additional 2.5 percent of the company.

As was the case in Chrysler, VEBA will have the right to select one independent director, and as in the case with Chrysler, and will be the case with both companies, neither VEBA nor UAW will have any right to voter's share or any other government right. So it is with the exception of one independent director, a purely passive interest.

As was the case with Chrysler, the qualified pension plan for both hourly and salaried employees will be carried over to the new GM and will remain intact and benefits will be paid in the normal course.

Thirdly, as I mentioned, the U.S. Treasury is preparing to provide about $30 billion of additional financing through -- inaudible -- possession process during this Chapter 11 to meet both working capital needs during the bankruptcy process as well as to refinance certain existing obligations, and as well as to be sure that the company has the means to be successful in the future. And I'll talk a little bit more about that in a second.

The U.S. Treasury does not believe or anticipate that any additional assistance to GM will be required. We intend for this to be a permanent resolution of the GM situation and an ability for the company to go forward and be profitable.

In exchange for the $30.1 billion, the U.S. government will receive about $9 billion of debt and preferred stock in the new GM and approximately 60 percent of the equity in the new company.

Let me emphasize in anticipation of those later discussion and questions that we did not seek or solicit or desire to have this equity position. We came upon it simply as a matter of prudence and out of desire to assure that GM was able to go forward with a flexible, deleverage balance sheet, one that is capable of sustaining itself during -- in a very cyclical business in what is obviously a difficult environment. And so we had a choice as guardians of the taxpayer dollars, which was to either take this equity as part of the consideration that we could receive on behalf of the U.S. taxpayers, and hopefully have it result in the taxpayers receiving a greater recovery, or we could have simply left it behind and given it to others and taxpayers would have ended up much shorter in terms of the total outcome. So the equity ownership of the U.S. government is not something we sought or desired; it was simply a necessary outcome of the restructuring process and a desire to have GM with a substantially deleveraged balance sheet and able to be competitive.

We're also very pleased to say that the governments of Canada and Ontario -- similar to the situation with Chrysler, will participate alongside the Treasury by lending about $9.5 billion and they will also receive both debt and preferred stock and about 12 percent of the equity in the new GM, and similar to the case with Chrysler, the right to pick one of the initial directors.

I think at that point I will -- I think I've covered now the main points on GM, so let me turn it back to Robert



MR. GIBBS: Thanks. Before we take questions on that -- do you want to go through our government ownership principles now? I know it's a big part of what a lot of folks are interested in.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure, let me take that on and start by saying that while this, of course applies to GM right now, this is part of a much broader effort to articulate principles for the U.S. government investments in a series of other companies as well. So this is more about how we can expect the government to act as a common shareholder in this and other cases.

The first starting point is really to pick up on something you said, which is the government really has no desire to own equity stakes in companies any longer than is absolutely necessary and will actively seek to dispose its ownership interest as soon as it is practical to do that. The goal is to promote strong, viable companies that can become profitable quickly, can contribute to growth and jobs without government involvement. And there is absolute clarity about that.

Of course, in exceptional cases where the U.S. government feels it's necessary to respond to a company's request for assistance the government has decided to reserve the right to set upfront conditions that will protect taxpayers and promote the financial stability or encourage growth. And in the sense of -- inaudible -- conditions, there has been some -- as you've seen in this restructuring and in some other companies, where necessary, these conditions are precisely the kinds of restructuring that my colleague has talked about and would focus primarily on ensuring a strong board of directors, that focuses on the right kind of management that can deliver a long-term vision, that gets these companies to be profitable, ends the need for government support as quickly as is practical.

Now, after those upfront conditions are in place, the government feels that it can protect taxpayers' investment by managing its ownership stake as a hands-off in a commercial manner as possible. And so the government will not interfere with or exert control over day-to-day company operations and very much will ensure that no government employees will serve on board or be employed by the company it makes investments in.

As a shareholder, the government will limit what it votes on to core governance issues, particularly the selection of the company's board of directors; major corporate events or transactions. And in its effort to protect taxpayers' resources as much as possible, the government intends to be extremely disciplined as to how it uses even these limited rights.

So those, as I said, are the principles that apply here in the upfront restructuring of GM and in the intention of the government going forward, but are consistently being applied where the U.S. finds itself in these kinds of situations.

MS. PSAKI: Thank you so much. I think we're ready to turn it over to questions at this point.

Q Good evening. Appreciating that this is obviously a bigger company than Chrysler, how quickly do you expect you can get it through, and do you expect that legally it will be more difficult?



SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: In 60 to 90 days; more complicated and many more moving pieces, but we are hopeful that it will have a similar successful outcome.

Q Can you speak a little bit about the input that you will have on the selection of some of the directors -- you're not naming them directly, but you will have input into who some of the new board members are -- what kind of direct or indirect input, and what would you be looking for in the directors?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Let me say a couple of things about that. First, you'll recall that at the time the President, on March 30th -- announced that a majority of the directors of new General Motors would be new, so by implication, there will be a number of existing General Motors directors that will continue with the new company and there will be identified, based on consultations between the current chairman and his colleagues and ourselves -- there has been a process underway since that announcement, led by the General Motors board, to identify additional directors, again in consultation with the U.S. government.

Thirdly, with respect to the kinds of people that are being sought, they are business leaders, CEOs, former CEOS, people from other walks of life with relevant experience and can contribute, regardless of political background, affiliation, or nature. And I would point you to the selection of the term at Chrysler, Bob Kidder, very distinguished former businessman, former CEO of Borden, former CEO of Duracell, his politics are not known to any of us anyway, who has agreed to take this on because of his belief in this industry and belief and desire that Chrysler could succeed. And I think Bob Kidder exemplifies the type of individual that will be sought to serve on the new General Motors board.

Q Are we going to see the new board members named tomorrow or is that a longer process?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I would expect over the 60 to 90 days, by the time the company comes out of bankruptcy 60 or 90 days from now, I would expect you to see substantial additions to the GM board.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: As a technical matter, these directors will actually join the board of New Co., which will be buying the assets out of General Motors.



Q Gentlemen, can you specify how the UAW negotiations altered the restructuring plan and are there still the number of plants being closed as before, even though there is one new assembly plant -- also how would the process for -- inaudible -- dealer count of GM mirror or change from that used by Chrysler in its bankruptcy case?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We were involved in helping to facilitate the discussions between the UAW and General Motors, but I think those are matters that are best left to the two of them. I think the UAW has spoken about its contracts and what it believes. Obviously the vast majority of its members have ratified it. And General Motors has spoken about the contract. So I think they're both satisfied with it and we're satisfied with it, but we don't see a need to get into the details.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And with respect to your second question, GM has already embarked on the beginnings of its new -- inaudible -- program. They have different management in process, so inevitably it thinks about life slightly differently and so it's a slightly different process that they're going through, but the goal and the end result is intended to be very similar.

Q Can you talk a little bit about how long it might take to get all this money back over time and what your expectations are as to how much the taxpayer might see back on this?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't think we're here today to predict or project. We designed the restructuring to maximize the potential for taxpayer money. The company has done a great job on the operational restructuring -- in conjunction with our colleagues in order to facilitate that. And so we certainly intend to maximize taxpayer proceeds, but I would also point you back to what my colleague said, that we intend to also exit as soon as practical.

Q My question is to expand the subsidiary of GM. Australia, for instance, has got a subsidiary of General Motors America. What will happen to those subsidiaries, and will there be any restrictions on the new GM investing in factories overseas, like for instance, the factory in Australia?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: One of the principles that the President established early on that we have very much intimated as part of this is that U.S. taxpayer dollars should stay within the U.S. And that is not intended to sound protectionist -- I think it's a principle that every country follows. And so we do not intend to use U.S. taxpayer dollars to support foreign subsidiaries. Happily, most of GM's foreign subsidiaries are able to sustain themselves independently or by receiving support from their local governments, as I believe will be the case in Australia. We have had contacts with the Australian government on this matter and I believe they're intending to support GM Australia.

You're all aware of the restructuring of Opal -- of GM Europe, and that was effected under the same set of principles, and those are the principles that we intend to maintain going forward. I think having a global footprint is certainly an advantage to General Motors, and to the extent that it is financially prudent and within those principles, we'd certainly like to see it continue.

Q Good evening. Could you give us a sense whether any members on the current GM board will be remaining on the board of the new company, and how that will work with the lead executives at GM, as well, please?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I believe I already answered that question by reminding you that the President, on March 30th, said that the majority of the GM board will become new members, which means a minority will be old members. And so we do expect to have some continuity with respect to those members. Fritz Henderson is the CEO and like all CEOs, serves at the pleasure of the board, and we would expect that that relationship would continue.

Q As GM restructures and the government is now involved in that company, how -- or will the government get involved in new jobs, or should I say, fuel-efficient, alternative-fuel sources, starting with that type of training with GM employees?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: As my colleague suggested, there are a number of principles that are going to govern our behavior as a shareholder in this company and others, one of which is no involvement in day-to-day business matters. And that will be a continuing principle for us. Of course the government of the United States has many relationships with the automobile industry as a whole, including foreign companies and including companies that have not been the beneficiaries of financial support from the U.S. government. And those matters, whether they go to regulation for fuel efficiency, or regulation for safety or support, or employment or what have you, will continue, but they will continue on a track entirely separate from and not driven by our role as shareholders.

I might mention the President some time ago appointed Ed Montgomery, the former deputy secretary of labor, to support him in assuring that we were doing everything that we could for communities in Michigan.

Q I was just wondering if you guys are disclosing which plants or factories may close as part of all this restructuring. I know there's been talk of 14, or is that still up in the air right now or haven't been determined?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: As I said earlier, General Motors I believe is in the process of releasing that information, and I think, in the context of what my colleague said about us not making plant-by-plant or any other kind of management decisions, we will leave that to them.

Q Thank you. I've got a couple of quick things. Are secured bondholders, do they get a hundred percent back? Does the tax lump carry forward, go to the new company? And can you say that there's no negative impact on Ford from these arrangements that you've described? Thank you.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: With respect to the first question, there are no secured bondholders in GM; there are secured banks, and they will receive a full recovery because they are amply secured, as distinct from the banks in Chrysler which were not fully secured.

With respect to your second question, I'm going to let my colleague answer -- would you expect the transfer? And what was the third question? Oh, Ford.



SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Ford has ample financial resources. Ford has been very successful in maintaining and even growing its market share during this period and is a world-class company, and we do believe completely -- and that has been the President's decision -- the belief that this country can support three domestic successful, viable auto companies.

Q Thanks, guys. A number of the principles -- the governmental principles you've established -- members of Congress have asked GM and the administration to keep the company from importing cars made in Chinese plants. Is that an issue that the administration will specifically stay away from, or will it take a position? Have you made a preference known to GM's management?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: GM has made a commitment in its later agreement with respect to production in North America. But as to any specific thing, no, that would be a kind of specific commercial thing and would not be the object of our negotiation with the company.

Q -- any additional money going into GM beyond the $30.1 billion that you're extending now -- is that an expectation, or are you saying, or will the President say that this is it for GM, this is the extent of taxpayer money and they won't get any additional funding?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There's no plan of any kind, intention, contingency plan, anything of any kind for further support beyond this point.

Q But beyond not having as plan are you saying that there's no way they will get --

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We believe the support being provided within a framework on a conservative economic assumption should allow the company if stakeholders do what they need to do, if its managers are successful in doing what they need to do, to be commercially viable going forward and not require extraordinary support going forward. One never says never with respect to any hypothetical contingency that could arise in the future, but this is it for support for GM, and on a go forward basis, GM's position will be the same as that of any other company in the United States.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We are reducing GM's liability by well over 50 percent and providing it with the financial flexibility that we truly believe -- and an enormous amount of work that's been done here that will allow it to be viable even under today's difficult economic circumstances.

Q I just wanted to ask what the sort of anticipated future of the whole task force operation that you all have set up is going to be? And maybe this answers that question, but whether there will be, six months from now or a year from now, some part of the U.S. government that will look after the shares that we will have in the two car companies, if only at a distance?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There are a number of people around the table who are looking at me with interest in how I answer this. On a go forward from here, moving through this bankruptcy where the government has a major role, there is a great deal to be done, and the staff of the task force will continue to be very active. The Cabinet members who comprise the task force will continue to play their role in providing expertise on a range of issues. On a go-forward basis, the government will obviously adjust its staffing to its needs. But for now, there's plenty to do.

Q As it is now, you guys have folks in Detroit -- I'm not sure what numbers there are. Is it anticipated that you'll continue to have representation on site going forward?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We don't have anybody in Detroit on any kind of long-term basis. People obviously go out there in the context of diligence. I think we -- in the context of what my colleague said about the government as shareholder, we are shareholders, like a lot of other people who don't control companies. And in that respect, we expect that the taxpayers will want us to monitor their investment and be sure that we understand what's going on, but we're not going to be having people based in Detroit or anything like that.

Q What will the government's position be in terms of executive compensation issues?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There are a series of laws and other regulations that exist, and the company will comply with all of them.

Q But will you -- you'll have the ability to name the compensation committee. Will you leave it to the compensation committee? Will there be any government policy -- because you have a policy with the banking bailout; I'm wondering if you're going to have any kind of a policy for this industrial company.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, there are a series of policies; there's the Dodd amendment, there will be regulations to implement the Dodd amendment in due course, and the company will live with them. We don't intend to name the compensation committee per se. We intend to, as we said, to work with the company and their initial directors, but the compensation committee will operate on its own. And we assume, just as it has during the period of the loan agreements where there were also compensation restrictions, that it will operate within them.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And like as in any company, the board will name a compensation committee.

Q Thanks, guys. Just a couple quick questions. Can you talk about the appointment of the chief restructuring officer and about the bad assets that GM will leave behind, even if you're not going to name the plants or the dealers that might be left behind? And also, is the government planning or encouraging any more management changes at GM?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think those are all pretty much questions for the company in terms of the naming of the chief restructuring officer is a company decision. The assets that will be left behind will be -- are being chosen, have been chosen by the company, and again we would direct you to them to answer those questions. And in terms of management changes, we have nothing further to announce on that at this time. As I said earlier, Fritz Henderson and other management key members serve at the pleasure of the board. It will be up to the existing board until emergence and then the new board to make any decisions about management.

MS. PSAKI: We have time for one more question.

Q I just wanted to go back to the question of the task force. In terms of the longevity of the task force, do you perceive it being needed well beyond the bankruptcy proceeding itself? I mean, do you perceive the task force being in existence in fact until the company is sold?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The company is not going to be -- I mean, I'm not sure what you mean by the company being sold. The company will go through this restructuring period; new GM will emerge as part of the 363 process; and then the company will continue, as we said, as a private company operating in the for-profit commercial role and so forth. And the government, as we indicated, is a reluctant -- will be a reluctant shareholder for only as long as is necessary, for as long as -- we will be out as soon as is practicable. During that period of time, we imagine that the taxpayers want us to be looking after their money, and so as we indicated, there will be people here watching over that investment, but as I indicated, in the nature of passive shareholders similar to Fidelity or some other large investment firm that has a large stake in a company.



MS. PSAKI: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. As a reminder, this is embargoed until 10:00 p.m. Eastern time.

116	"Rising to a New Generation of Global Challenges

Mitt Romney

From Foreign Affairs, July/August 2007

Summary: Washington is as divided on foreign policy as it has been at any point in the last 50 years. As the ""greatest generation"" did before us, we must move beyond political camps to unite around bold actions in order to build a strong America and a safer world. We must strengthen our military and economy, achieve energy independence, reenergize civilian and interagency capabilities, and revitalize our alliances. Mitt Romney, Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, is a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.

Topics:

U.S. policy and politics

National security and defense

WASHINGTON DIVIDED Less than six years after 9/11, Washington is as divided and conflicted over foreign policy as it has been at any point in the last 50 years. Senator Arthur Vandenberg once famously declared that ""politics stops at the water's edge""; today, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee declares that our major political parties should carry out two separate foreign policies. The Senate unanimously confirmed General David Petraeus, who pledged to implement a new strategy, as the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. Yet just weeks later, the Senate began crafting legislation specifically designed to stop that new strategy. More broadly, lines have been drawn between those labeled ""realists"" and those labeled ""neoconservatives."" Yet these terms mean little when even the most committed neoconservative recognizes that any successful policy must be grounded in reality and even the most hardened realist admits that much of the United States' power and influence stems from its values and ideals. In the midst of these divisions, the American people -- and many others around the world -- have increasing doubts about the United States' direction and role in the world. Indeed, it seems that concern about Washington's divisiveness and capability to meet today's challenges is the one thing that unites us all. We need new thinking on foreign policy and an overarching strategy that can unite the United States and its allies -- not around a particular political camp or foreign policy school but around a shared understanding of how to meet a new generation of challenges. A GENERATION'S LEGACY OF LEADERSHIP Today's challenges are daunting. They include the conflict in Iraq, the resurgence of the Taliban, and global terrorist networks made even more menacing by the threat of nuclear proliferation. While Iran's leaders relentlessly pursue nuclear weapons capabilities and spout genocidal threats against Israel, the world largely stands silent, unable to agree on effective sanctions even as each day the danger grows. Genocide ravages Darfur even as the world stands frozen. In Latin America, leaders such as Venezuelan President Hugo ChÃÂ¡vez seek to reverse the spread of freedom and return to failed authoritarian policies. AIDS and potential new pandemics threaten us in an interconnected world. The economic rise of China and other countries across Asia poses a different type of challenge. It is easy to understand why Americans -- and many others around the world -- feel so much unease and uncertainty. Yet although we face fundamentally different issues today, the United States has a history of rising to meet even greater challenges. Indeed, we need not look to ancient history, but only to the courage and determination of our parents and grandparents to see a stark contrast with the confusion and infighting of Washington today. Just over 60 years ago, we were in the midst of a global war that would take the lives of tens of millions. The outcome was far from certain. General Dwight Eisenhower drafted a short note before the D-day landings at Normandy accepting full responsibility ""in case of failure."" The invasion did not fail. Yet no sooner had we defeated fascism than we were engaged in a 50-year struggle with communism. Those whom the journalist Tom Brokaw memorialized as ""the greatest generation"" made the tough choices that allowed us to prevail in these struggles. And it was not just our Washington leaders who were decisive. In the 1940s, Americans rationed and saved, and mothers and daughters enlisted to work in factories. Together with the GIs who returned home, they built this country's prosperity and fueled a sense of optimism. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, America pursued learning and innovation to lead the world in space, technology, and productivity -- outcompeting the Soviets and driving them to an economic bankruptcy that matched their moral bankruptcy. In the aftermath of World War II and with the coming of the Cold War, members of ""the greatest generation"" united America and the free world around shared values and actions that changed history. They unified U.S. military and security efforts, creating the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. They rethought U.S. approaches to the world, building the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Peace Corps. They forged alliances, such as NATO, that magnified the power of freedom and created a world trading system that helped launch the greatest expansion of economic and political freedom and development in history. Our times call for equally bold leadership and for a renewed sense of service and shared sacrifice among Americans and our allies around the world. A NEW GENERATION OF CHALLENGES

117	"Liberal menace and purveyor of lies, Nancy Pelosi (D-California), was just taken from her office in handcuffs by the United States Secret Service. While little information is available as of yet, one agent did tell a reporter for the Washington Examiner that the arrest came at the direct order of the president:

Ã¢ÂÂMrs. PelosiÃ¢ÂÂs arrest order comes directly from the Oval Office,Ã¢ÂÂ said Special Agent Matthew Derpmore, Ã¢ÂÂSheÃ¢ÂÂs wanted for questioning in a possible coup attempt against the president. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs all weÃ¢ÂÂre authorized to say at this time.Ã¢ÂÂ

The White House OIP has confirmed that report, calling Pelosi a usurper and a threat to the office of President Trump:

Congresswoman Nancy PelosiÃ¢ÂÂs arrest for conspiacy to overthrow the office of the President is being taken very seriously. She is said to be at the head of a select group of congressmen who have set in motion plans to use the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs allegedly unlawful actions to begin imeachment hearings. Without evidence and with a clear denial from the president of these allegations such actions warrant charges of conspiracy and possibly even treason.

PelosiÃ¢ÂÂs office hasnÃ¢ÂÂt issued a statement yet. According to records obtained by Breitbart, three other congressmen are also wanted and are currently having warrants against them served. WeÃ¢ÂÂll keep you updated as the story progresses."	1

119	"Snopes Paid to Push Ã¢ÂÂPropagandaÃ¢ÂÂ by Facebook, Former Editor Reveals

Claims 'fact-checkers' are paid to 'appear to prevent damage' while pushing an agenda

ÃÂ© press Former managing editor at Snopes Brooke Binkowski says the 'fact-checker' is pushing 'propaganda'

Snopes is paid by Facebook to push ""propaganda,"" according to the former managing editor of the ""fact-checker,"" who claims the social media giant ""doesn't care"" about facts and is using journalists to promote an agenda so it can ""pass the buck.""

According to a bombshell report by the Guardian, several current and former Facebook fact-checkers have stepped forward and spoken out to reveal their distrust in the social network and their fact-checking employers.

Facebook has fact-checking partnerships with Snopes, PolitiFact, Factcheck.org, the Weekly Standard, and Associated Press, and uses the information provided by these organizations to reduce the reach of posts that are ""debunked"" in their News Feed.

The partnering with these fact-checkers has come under heavy criticism, mainly due to the almost-monopolized influence news on Facebook has, which is then being filtered out by unregulated individuals who are often financially motivated and express political bias.

Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂve essentially used us for crisis PR,Ã¢ÂÂ declared former Snopes managing editor Brooke Binkowski during an interview with the Guardian.

Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂre not taking anything seriously.

""They are more interested in making themselves look good and passing the buckÃ¢ÂÂ¦

""They clearly donÃ¢ÂÂt care.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre not doing journalism anymore. YouÃ¢ÂÂre doing propaganda,Ã¢ÂÂ she continued, adding, Ã¢ÂÂThey threw us under the bus at every opportunity.Ã¢ÂÂ

Another former Snopes employee, Kim LaCapria, recently left the company over its partnership with Facebook, accusing it of focusing only on the Ã¢ÂÂappearance of trying to prevent damage without actually doing anything,Ã¢ÂÂ and expressing distaste with the fact that Snopes was being paid by Facebook.

LaCapria said she was particularly upset to learn that Facebook was paying Snopes: Ã¢ÂÂThat felt really gross Ã¢ÂÂ¦ Facebook has one mission and fact-checking websites should have a completely different mission.Ã¢ÂÂ

Aside from allegedly being paid by Facebook, Snopes also generates revenue by filling its website with advertisements from Google Adsense, asking for donations from readers via PayPal, and has an active GoFundMe campaign to ""Save Snopes"" which has so far generated over $850,000 of its $2 million goal.

Of course, it's understandable that a website has overheads that need to be covered, but when a company is primarily driven by profit, how can they be trusted to remain non-partisan?

According to a report by the Daily Mail, Snopes founder David Mikkelson was accused of embezzling thousands from the company.

Mikkelson's ex-wife Barbara, claimed in legal documents he embezzled $98,000 of company money and spent it on ""himself and prostitutes.""

During the lengthy and bitter legal dispute, CEO David Mikkelson also claimed to be underpaid and was demanding the ""industry standard"" or at least $360,000 a year.

Being motivated by ""facts"" is apparently very lucrative.

And in the case of Snopes, their business model is a simple, yet devastatingly effective one since they partnered with Facebook and Google: They debunk viral news, and posts.

Therefore, if a post goes viral on social media, and Snopes says that it's ""false,"" then it will be flagged as so and Facebook will place a link to the ""fact-check,"" thus driving more traffic and revenue to Snopes.

Due to this arrangement, it adds a clear incentive to mark a viral news story as false rather than confirming lesser-known facts as true.

ÃÂ© press Snopes founder David Mikkelson was accused on embezzling company money

Over recent months this push to flag big news stories as ""false,"" mainly from conservative websites, has become more apparent.

In November, Breitbart accused Snopes of attempting to ""wash away"" the story of armed members of the New Black Panther Party campaigning for the Democrat gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, Stacey Abrams.

According to Breitbart, the move was an ""openly partisan"" attempt to protect Abrams after the damaging story went viral.

Earlier this month, The Daily Caller also accused Snopes of left-bias after it ""botched"" its fact-check of a viral meme that was mocked within political circles for spreading false information.

Snopes said that the Ã¢ÂÂgeneral ideaÃ¢ÂÂ of the meme was Ã¢ÂÂcorrect,Ã¢ÂÂ yet, according to the TheDCNF, the fact-checker intentionally framed it that way as it portrayed President Trump in a negative light if the ""wildly misleading"" meme was true.

In Snopes ""transparency"" disclaimer, it states that it operates ""without any partisan considerations,"" saying:

""We donÃ¢ÂÂt choose or exclude items for coverage based on whether they deal with Republican/Democratic, conservative/liberal, or religious/secular issues.""

Despite this statement, the left-leaning bias of their fact-checkers is clear.

Snopes' ""science dude"" Alex Kasprak makes no secret of his political bias, and one look at his Twitter account shows it is filled with anti-Trump rhetoric and retweets of Trump-bashing posts.

The only way to report on that ""totally clears the president"" tweet is to highlight it as an example of our president's abject delusion, not as a valid legal opinion or as ""breaking news"" Ã¢ÂÂ Alex H. Kasprak (@alexkasprak) December 8, 2018





Prior to joining Snopes, Kasprak wrote for left-wing news outlets Motherboard and BuzzFeed and is pegged as a ""science writer"" who mainly ""debunks"" science-related articles.

It comes as no surprise then that Kasprak mainly fact-checks conservative news sites, often using derogatory language when describing the outlets and their writers, using terms such as ""right-wing blog"" and ""junk news.""

Biting the hand that feeds

Snopes apparent bias has seen the company suffer considerably over recent months as it continues to abuse its influence over Facebook's News Feed to promote a political agenda.

Visits to snopes.com have plummeted by almost half over recent months as users are seemingly losing trust in the organization.

According to website data tool SimilarWeb, visits to Snopes dropped another 20 percent in November to 19.59 million for the month.

This number is a considerable drop from their July figure of 37.79 million, representing a staggering 48.16 percent drop in website traffic in just four months.

While it's unclear what has caused this drop, when you consider that being flagged as ""fake news"" on Facebook cuts reach to the websites being debunked, it's clear to see that attacking the sources of their viral ""fact-checks,"" is hardly sustainable if it destroys the sites that it continually attacks.

ÃÂ© SimilarWeb Website visits to Snopes have plummeted by almost 50 percent since July

The appearance of trying to prevent damage

Ã¢ÂÂWhy should we trust Facebook when itÃ¢ÂÂs pushing the same rumors that its own fact checkers are calling fake news?Ã¢ÂÂ an unnamed Facebook fact-checker told the Guardian.

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs worth asking how do they treat stories about George Soros on the platform knowing they specifically pay people to try to link political enemies to him?[Ã¢ÂÂ¦] Working with Facebook makes us look bad.Ã¢ÂÂ

According to Breitbart, one fact-checker who has reportedly Ã¢ÂÂlong workedÃ¢ÂÂ with Facebook even referred to the social network as a Ã¢ÂÂterrible company,Ã¢ÂÂ declaring, Ã¢ÂÂand, on a personal level, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to have anything to do with them,Ã¢ÂÂ while another fact-checker proclaimed, Ã¢ÂÂMost of us feel itÃ¢ÂÂs more trouble than itÃ¢ÂÂs worth.Ã¢ÂÂ

Facebook started its fact-checking efforts following President TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs 2016 presidential election victory and is even expanding into fact-checking images and videos.

Left-wing biases have been found at nearly all Facebook fact-check partners in the United States, including Snopes, Politifact, and the Weekly Standard.

An investigation revealed that Snopes employs left-wing people almost exclusively, with some of its most prominent fact-checkers openly describing themselves as Ã¢ÂÂprogressiveÃ¢ÂÂ and expressing anti-Trump sentiment.

A satirical article from popular satire website Babylon Bee about CNN using a washing machine to Ã¢ÂÂspin the news,Ã¢ÂÂ was also nearly removed by Facebook after Snopes fact-checked it as false.

One of FacebookÃ¢ÂÂs other top fact-checking partners, Politifact, is funded by a frequent Clinton Foundation donor, and gave preferential treatment to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election Ã¢ÂÂ rating 51 percent of ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs claims as true versus just over 15 percent for Trump.

Even a 2013 article from one of FacebookÃ¢ÂÂs other fact-checking partners, the Weekly Standard, claimed Politifact Ã¢ÂÂhas it out for Republicans,Ã¢ÂÂ and the Weekly Standard itself has also pushed out misleading information during its partnership with Facebook.

UPDATE: Since this article was published, and subsequently went viral on social media, Snopes CEO David Mikkelson denied the information we presented in this article. Snopes didn't ""fact-check"" or ""debunk"" any of the information, nor did they present any evidence to refute the claims. Mikkelson, however, saw fit to abuse his position as Facebook approved ""fact-checker"" and flagged our story as a ""hoax"" with Facebook, pulling it from users' News Feed, immediately squashing the story as a result. Make of that what you will."	1
120	"NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) -- Presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama debated in Nashville, Tennessee, on Tuesday night. NBC's Tom Brokaw moderated the debate. Here is a transcript of that debate.

Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain meet in Nashville for their second debate.

Brokaw: Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. I'm Tom Brokaw of NBC News. And welcome to this second presidential debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.

Tonight's debate is the only one with a town hall format. The Gallup Organization chose 80 uncommitted voters from the Nashville area to be here with us tonight. And earlier today, each of them gave me a copy of their question for the candidates.

From all of these questions -- and from tens of thousands submitted online -- I have selected a long list of excellent questions on domestic and foreign policy.

Neither the commission nor the candidates have seen the questions. And although we won't be able to get to all of them tonight, we should have a wide-ranging discussion one month before the election.

Each candidate will have two minutes to respond to a common question, and there will be a one-minute follow-up. The audience here in the hall has agreed to be polite, and attentive, no cheering or outbursts. Those of you at home, of course, are not so constrained.

The only exception in the hall is right now, as it is my privilege to introduce the candidates, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Sen. John McCain of Arizona.

Gentlemen?

Gentlemen, we want to get under way immediately, if we can. Since you last met at Ole Miss 12 days ago, the world has changed a great deal, and not for the better. We still don't know where the bottom is at this time.

As you might expect, many of the questions that we have from here in the hall tonight and from online have to do with the American economy and, in fact, with global economic conditions.

I understand that you flipped a coin.

And, Sen. Obama, you will begin tonight. And we're going to have our first question from over here in Section A from Allen Shaffer.

Allen?

Shaffer: With the economy on the downturn and retired and older citizens and workers losing their incomes, what's the fastest, most positive solution to bail these people out of the economic ruin?

Obama: Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question. I want to first, obviously, thank Belmont University, Tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in.

I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.

And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Sen. McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us.

It hasn't worked out that way. And so now we've got to take some decisive action.

Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week. We've got to make sure that works properly. And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors.

It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package. And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket.

And I'll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired. But that's only step one. The middle-class need a rescue package. And that means tax cuts for the middle-class.

It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes. It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs.

And then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. You need somebody working for you and you've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists.

Brokaw: Sen. McCain?

McCain: Well, thank you, Tom. Thank you, Belmont University. And Sen. Obama, it's good to be with you at a town hall meeting.

And, Alan (ph), thank you for your question. You go to the heart of America's worries tonight. Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful. It's our job to fix the problem.

Now, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence. We've got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't want us very -- like us very much. We have to keep Americans' taxes low. All Americans' taxes low. Let's not raise taxes on anybody today.

We obviously have to stop this spending spree that's going on in Washington. Do you know that we've laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China?

We've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world. And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we're going to have to do something about home values.

You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments. As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.

Is it expensive? Yes. But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy. And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.

I know how the do that, my friends. And it's my proposal, it's not Sen. Obama's proposal, it's not President Bush's proposal. But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans. Thank you.

Brokaw: Senator, we have one minute for a discussion here. Obviously the powers of the treasury secretary have been greatly expanded. The most powerful officer in the cabinet now. Hank Paulson says he won't stay on. Who do you have in mind to appoint to that very important post?

Sen. McCain?

McCain: Not you, Tom.

Brokaw: No, with good reason.

McCain: You know, that's a tough question and there's a lot of qualified Americans. But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual.

A supporter of Sen. Obama's is Warren Buffett [chairman of Berkshire Hathaway]. He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today.

I like Meg Whitman [former CEO of eBay and current McCain campaign adviser], she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace. She knows how to create jobs. Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay. Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them.

But the point is it's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence. Because the problem in America today to a large extent, Tom, is that we don't have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D.C.

Brokaw: All right. Sen. McCain -- Sen. Obama, who do you have in mind for treasury secretary?

Obama: Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support. But there are other folks out there. The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.

Prosperity is not just going to trickle down. We've got to help the middle class.

And we've -- you know, Sen. McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Sen. McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound.

Part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined. For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire.

And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet.

Sen. McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices. But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income. That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.

Brokaw: Sen. Obama, thank you very much.

May I remind both of you, if I can, that we're operating under rules that you signed off on and when we have a discussion, it really is to be confined within about a minute or so.

We're going to go now, Sen. McCain, to the next question from you from the hall here, and it comes from Oliver Clark, who is over here in section F.

Oliver?

Clark: Well, Senators, through this economic crisis, most of the people that I know have had a difficult time. And through this bailout package, I was wondering what it is that's going to actually help those people out.

McCain: Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.

I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers -- and it will recover -- and a number of other measures.

But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis.

But you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Sen. Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back.

And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we've got to enact legislation to fix this. We've got to stop this greed and excess.

Meanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some -- and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change.

Meanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions. Sen. Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history -- in history.

So this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions. But it's not enough. That's why we're going to have to go out into the housing market and we're going to have to buy up these bad loans and we're going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, Americans, like Alan, can realize the American dream and stay in their home.

But Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire. There were some of us -- there were some of us that stood up against it. There were others who took a hike.

Brokaw: Sen. Obama?

Obama: Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you what's in the rescue package for you. Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.

If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll. If they can't make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off.

And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country.

So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that's why we had to take action. But we shouldn't have been there in the first place.

Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Sen. McCain's history, not surprisingly. Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.

Sen. McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator. On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.

I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman [Ben] Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it.

A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we've got to reregulate, and nothing happened.

And Sen. McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.

Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Sen. McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill. He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed.

And I never promoted Fannie Mae. In fact, Sen. McCain's campaign chairman's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me.

So -- but, look, you're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers. What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?

This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process. And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.

The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet. And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.

Brokaw: Sen. Obama, time for a discussion. I'm going to begin with you. Are you saying to Mr. Clark (ph) and to the other members of the American television audience that the American economy is going to get much worse before it gets better and they ought to be prepared for that?

Obama: No, I am confident about the American economy. But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.

The problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets. We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.

But most importantly, we're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren't driving the process and your voices aren't being drowned out.

Brokaw: Sen. McCain, in all candor, do you think the economy is going to get worse before it gets better?

McCain: I think it depends on what we do. I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market -- which I believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home -- I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively.

My friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis. Sen. Obama's name was not on that letter.

The point is -- the point is that we can fix our economy. Americans' workers are the best in the world. They're the fundamental aspect of America's economy.

They're the most innovative. They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters. We're the best importers. They're most effective. They are the best workers in the world.

And we've got to give them a chance. They've got -- we've got to give them a chance to do their best again. And they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time. We can do it.

Brokaw: Thank you, Sen. McCain.

We're going to continue over in Section F, as it turns out.

Sen. Obama, this is a question from you from Teresa Finch.

Teresa?

Finch: How can we trust either of you with our money when both parties got -- got us into this global economic crisis?

Obama: Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you've been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here, you've got a family budget. If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts. Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much. Maybe you put off buying a new car.

That's not what happens in Washington. And you're right. There is a lot of blame to go around.

But I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history. When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses. And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually.

When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion. It's now over $10 trillion. We've almost doubled it.

And so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history. And Sen. McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.

So here's what I would do. I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.

You know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up. We've got to reform health care to help you and your budget.

We are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia. We are mortgaging our children's future. We've got to have a different energy plan.

We've got to invest in college affordability. So we're going to have to make some investments, but we've also got to make spending cuts. And what I've proposed, you'll hear Sen. McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.

The key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests. We've got to put an end to that.

Brokaw: Sen. McCain?

McCain: Well, Theresa (ph), thank you. And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken. And I have been a consistent reformer.

I have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Sen. [Russ] Feingold [D-Wisconsin] on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with Sen. Lieberman on trying to address climate change.

I have a clear record of bipartisanship. The situation today cries out for bipartisanship. Sen. Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue. And we need to reform.

And so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric. That's really part of your mistrust here. And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time.

I don't expect you to watch every vote. And you know what you'll find? This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate. I have fought against excessive spending and outrages. I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.

Do you know that Sen. Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now? New spending. Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks?

He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois. My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?

I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his. Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again.

You're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them. And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that. And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.

Brokaw: We've run out of time. We have this one-minute discussion period going on here.

There are new economic realities out there that everyone in this hall and across this country understands that there are going to have to be some choices made. Health policies, energy policies, and entitlement reform, what are going to be your priorities in what order? Which of those will be your highest priority your first year in office and which will follow in sequence?

Sen. McCain?

McCain: The three priorities were health...

Brokaw: The three -- health care, energy, and entitlement reform: Social Security and Medicare. In what order would you put them in terms of priorities?

McCain: I think you can work on all three at once, Tom. I think it's very important that reform our entitlement programs.

My friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today. We're going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.

I know how to do that. I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others. That's my clear record.

We can work on nuclear power plants. Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs. We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology. All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it.

My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.

As far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care. That's the next issue.

But we can do them all at once. There's no -- and we have to do them all at once. All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.

Brokaw: I'm trying to play by the rules that you all established. One minute for discussion.

Sen. Obama, if you would give us your list of priorities, there are some real questions about whether everything can be done at once.

Obama: We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize. Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.

Energy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up. And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.

So we've got to deal with that right away. That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years. Our goal should be, in 10 year's time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil.

And we can do it. Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done. So that would be priority number one.

Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it's making our businesses less competitive.

And, number three, we've got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy.

But just one point I want to make, Tom. Sen. McCain mentioned looking at our records. We do need to look at our records.

Sen. McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot. And that's important. I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.

But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going. So when Sen. McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he's going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that's money out of the system.

And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you. That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.

Brokaw: All right, gentlemen, I want to just remind you one more time about time. We're going to have a larger deficit than the federal government does if we don't get this under control here before too long.

Sen. McCain, for you, we have our first question from the Internet tonight. A child of the Depression, 78-year-old Fiorra from Chicago.

Since World War II, we have never been asked to sacrifice anything to help our country, except the blood of our heroic men and women. As president, what sacrifices -- sacrifices will you ask every American to make to help restore the American dream and to get out of the economic morass that we're now in?

McCain: Well, Fiorra, I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate.

I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government. And we're going to have to eliminate those that aren't working.

I know a lot of them that aren't working. One of them is in defense spending, because I've taken on some of the defense contractors. I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion.

I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks. And sometimes those projects, not -- not the overhead projector that Sen. Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have -- will have to be eliminated, as well.

And they'll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others.

So we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America. And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze.

And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.

And, by the way, I want to go back a second.

Look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time. We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here. We are Americans. We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together.

Frankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, ""I'm sorry, you'll have to wait."" I'm going to tell you Americans we'll get to work right away and we'll get to work together, and we can get them all done, because that's what America has been doing.

Brokaw: Sen. McCain, thank you very much.

Sen. Obama?

Obama: You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.

And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, ""Go out and shop.""

That wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.

And so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government.

And let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.

I believe in the need for increased oil production. We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.

We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.

But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.

And that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.

And the last point I just want to make. I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.

That's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.

Brokaw: Sen. Obama, as we begin, very quickly, our discussion period, President Bush, you'll remember, last summer, said that ""Wall Street got drunk.""

A lot of people now look back and think the federal government got drunk and, in fact, the American consumers got drunk.

How would you, as president, try to break those bad habits of too much debt and too much easy credit, specifically, across the board, for this country, not just at the federal level, but as a model for the rest of the country, as well?

Obama: Well, I think it starts with Washington. We've got to show that we've got good habits, because if we're running up trillion dollar debts that we're passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, ""Well, you know what? There's easy money out there.""

It means -- and I have to, again, repeat this. It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side. I mean, Sen. McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget.

Now, when Sen. McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden.

And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.

I mean, you know, it's tough to ask a teacher who's making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog.

And that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Sen. McCain about an across-the- board freeze.

That's an example of an unfair burden sharing. Tha"	0
121	"After ABC cancels Roseanne BarrÃ¢ÂÂs hit show in response to her stunning racist tweet, the network of bigots comes to the rescue.

Advertisement Ã¢ÂÂ story continues below

Just hours after ABC canceled its hit sitcom Ã¢ÂÂRoseanneÃ¢ÂÂ due to an ugly racist tweet by its controversial star, Roseanne Barr, the Fox Network said it would be picking up the show.

Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre excited to announce that Ã¢ÂÂRoseanneÃ¢ÂÂ will be coming to Fox this fall,Ã¢ÂÂ said Brian Sullivan, Fox Networks Group president and COO. Ã¢ÂÂThe controversy regarding Ms. BarrÃ¢ÂÂs racially charged Twitter message, as well as her bigoted attitudes, are just some of the reasons weÃ¢ÂÂre happy to welcome her to the Fox family. And we know our audience of narrow-minded, unsophisticated bumpkins will welcome her just as enthusiastically.Ã¢ÂÂ

In her vulgar post, Ms. Barr wrote that Valerie Jarrett, an African-American adviser to President Barack Obama, was the offspring of the Ã¢ÂÂmuslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.Ã¢ÂÂ The abhorrent tweet met with immediate condemnation on social media from all moderate voices, but cheers among FoxÃ¢ÂÂs white supremacist fans.

President Donald Trump, who had called Ms. Barr earlier in the year to congratulate her on the success of her show, and who uses Fox programming to promote his administrationÃ¢ÂÂs policies, was thrilled to hear that Ã¢ÂÂRoseanneÃ¢ÂÂ would be coming to his favorite network.

Ã¢ÂÂBig news for Ã¢ÂÂRoseanneÃ¢ÂÂ fans and everyone who enjoys Ã¢ÂÂblackÃ¢ÂÂ humor,Ã¢ÂÂ tweeted the president on Tuesday night. Ã¢ÂÂI know that all Ms. Barr wants to do is make America great again and kudos to Fox for keeping that hope alive.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂRoseanneÃ¢ÂÂ will air on Monday nights at 8:00pm on the Fox Network starting in September.

By PolitiFact staff

PolitiFact is annotating the second presidential debate at Washington University. We will be posting the transcript and our annotations through the night. Follow us on Medium and check back regularly to see our commentary.

RADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.

COOPER: Thank you very much for being here. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so youÃ¢ÂÂll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?

QUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as studentsÃ¢ÂÂ homework, do you feel youÃ¢ÂÂre modeling appropriate and positive behavior for todayÃ¢ÂÂs youth?

CLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that thatÃ¢ÂÂs a very good question, because IÃ¢ÂÂve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.

And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because weÃ¢ÂÂre good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them into working on behalf of our country.

I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why the slogan of my campaign is Ã¢ÂÂStronger Together,Ã¢ÂÂ because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals Ã¢ÂÂ and IÃ¢ÂÂve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.

If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, thereÃ¢ÂÂs nothing in my opinion that America canÃ¢ÂÂt do. So thatÃ¢ÂÂs why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, IÃ¢ÂÂm hoping to earn your vote, IÃ¢ÂÂm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.

I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because thatÃ¢ÂÂs, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.

TRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. IÃ¢ÂÂve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that IÃ¢ÂÂve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe IÃ¢ÂÂm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.

TRUMP: And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, itÃ¢ÂÂs a one-sided transaction where weÃ¢ÂÂre giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, weÃ¢ÂÂve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.

When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs in business and trade, where weÃ¢ÂÂre doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. ItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to believe. Inconceivable.

You say whoÃ¢ÂÂs making these deals? WeÃ¢ÂÂre going the make great deals. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to have a strong border. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.

But I want to do things that havenÃ¢ÂÂt been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. ItÃ¢ÂÂs called make America great again.

COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for todayÃ¢ÂÂs youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?

TRUMP: No, I didnÃ¢ÂÂt say that at all. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think you understood what was Ã¢ÂÂ this was locker room talk. IÃ¢ÂÂm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly IÃ¢ÂÂm not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.

You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have Ã¢ÂÂ and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.

And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on.

Yes, IÃ¢ÂÂm very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But itÃ¢ÂÂs locker room talk, and itÃ¢ÂÂs one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.

COOPER: So, Mr. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.

COOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?

TRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.

COOPER: So, for the record, youÃ¢ÂÂre saying you never did that?

TRUMP: IÃ¢ÂÂve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.

COOPER: Have you ever done those things?

TRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that IÃ¢ÂÂm going to make our country safe. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to have borders in our country, which we donÃ¢ÂÂt have now. People are pouring into our country, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre coming in from the Middle East and other places.

WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to make America safe again. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to make America great again, but weÃ¢ÂÂre going to make America safe again. And weÃ¢ÂÂre going to make America wealthy again, because if you donÃ¢ÂÂt do that, it just Ã¢ÂÂ it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.

COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

TRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and theyÃ¢ÂÂre taking our wealth.

COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

TRUMP: And thatÃ¢ÂÂs what I want to talk about.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?

CLINTON: Well, like everyone else, IÃ¢ÂÂve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.

Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesnÃ¢ÂÂt represent who he is.

But I think itÃ¢ÂÂs clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because weÃ¢ÂÂve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. WeÃ¢ÂÂve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. WeÃ¢ÂÂve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.

So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But itÃ¢ÂÂs not only women, and itÃ¢ÂÂs not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.

So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why Ã¢ÂÂ to go back to your question Ã¢ÂÂ I want to send a message Ã¢ÂÂ we all should Ã¢ÂÂ to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.

CLINTON: These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if IÃ¢ÂÂm so fortunate enough to become your president.

RADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from onlineÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.

RADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that.

TRUMP: ItÃ¢ÂÂs just words, folks. ItÃ¢ÂÂs just words. Those words, IÃ¢ÂÂve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.

IÃ¢ÂÂve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. IÃ¢ÂÂm going to help the African-Americans. IÃ¢ÂÂm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.

SheÃ¢ÂÂs done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaignÃ¢ÂÂ¦

RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump Ã¢ÂÂ I want to get to audience questions and online questions.

TRUMP: So, sheÃ¢ÂÂs allowed to do that, but IÃ¢ÂÂm not allowed to respond?

RADDATZ: YouÃ¢ÂÂre going to have Ã¢ÂÂ youÃ¢ÂÂre going to get to respond right now.

TRUMP: Sounds fair.

RADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, itÃ¢ÂÂs become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, Ã¢ÂÂTrump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?Ã¢ÂÂ So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.

TRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. IÃ¢ÂÂm not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, IÃ¢ÂÂm not proud of it. But that was something that happened.

If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what heÃ¢ÂÂs done to women. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs never been anybody in the history politics in this nation thatÃ¢ÂÂs been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.

Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and sheÃ¢ÂÂs seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.

So donÃ¢ÂÂt tell me about words. I am absolutely Ã¢ÂÂ I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, whoÃ¢ÂÂs also here tonight.

And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think itÃ¢ÂÂs disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.

(APPLAUSE)

RADDATZ: Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.

CLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what heÃ¢ÂÂs just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering peopleÃ¢ÂÂs questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, thatÃ¢ÂÂs his choice.

When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.

(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what heÃ¢ÂÂs saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.

CLINTON: He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.

He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldnÃ¢ÂÂt be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, Ã¢ÂÂMexican.Ã¢ÂÂ

He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.

TRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal Ã¢ÂÂ heÃ¢ÂÂs another real winner that you have Ã¢ÂÂ and heÃ¢ÂÂs the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. YouÃ¢ÂÂre the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.

Number two, Michelle Obama. IÃ¢ÂÂve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And IÃ¢ÂÂve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials IÃ¢ÂÂve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.

So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.

But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.

And IÃ¢ÂÂll tell you what. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt think IÃ¢ÂÂd say this, but IÃ¢ÂÂm going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have a special prosecutor.

When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails Ã¢ÂÂ and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.

So weÃ¢ÂÂre going to get a special prosecutor, and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to look into it, because you know what? People have been Ã¢ÂÂ their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what youÃ¢ÂÂve done. And itÃ¢ÂÂs a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: IÃ¢ÂÂm going to let you talk about e-mails.

CLINTON: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ because everything he just said is absolutely false, but IÃ¢ÂÂm not surprised.

TRUMP: Oh, really?

CLINTON: In the first debateÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(LAUGHTER)

RADDATZ: And really, the audience needs to calm down here.

CLINTON: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. IÃ¢ÂÂd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how weÃ¢ÂÂre going to really make lives better for people.

So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump Ã¢ÂÂ you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect weÃ¢ÂÂll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.

TRUMP: Because youÃ¢ÂÂd be in jail.

(APPLAUSE)

RADDATZ: Secretary ClintonÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. YouÃ¢ÂÂre just wasting time.

RADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. YouÃ¢ÂÂve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, Ã¢ÂÂextremely careless.Ã¢ÂÂ The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You donÃ¢ÂÂt call that extremely careless? CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say Ã¢ÂÂ and IÃ¢ÂÂve said before, but IÃ¢ÂÂll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it Ã¢ÂÂ that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. IÃ¢ÂÂm not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that.

But I think itÃ¢ÂÂs also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all Ã¢ÂÂ anyone who says otherwise has no basis Ã¢ÂÂ that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.

I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.

RADDATZ: OK, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to move on.

TRUMP: And yet she didnÃ¢ÂÂt know the word Ã¢ÂÂ the letter C on a document. Right? She didnÃ¢ÂÂt even know what that word Ã¢ÂÂ what that letter meant.

You know, itÃ¢ÂÂs amazing. IÃ¢ÂÂm watching Hillary go over facts. And sheÃ¢ÂÂs going after fact after fact, and sheÃ¢ÂÂs lying again, because she said she Ã¢ÂÂ you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I donÃ¢ÂÂt think so.

She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughterÃ¢ÂÂs wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe weÃ¢ÂÂll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now sheÃ¢ÂÂs saying there wasnÃ¢ÂÂt anything wrong.

And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasnÃ¢ÂÂt before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And IÃ¢ÂÂll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.

Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did Ã¢ÂÂ and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.

COOPER: We have to move on.

TRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.

RADDATZ: We want to give the audience a chance.

TRUMP: If you did that in the private sector, youÃ¢ÂÂd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question.

CLINTON: Look, itÃ¢ÂÂs just not true. And so please, go toÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: Oh, you didnÃ¢ÂÂt delete them?

COOPER: Allow her to respond, please.

CLINTON: It was personal e-mails, not official.

TRUMP: Oh, 33,000? Yeah.

CLINTON: Not Ã¢ÂÂ well, we turned over 35,000, soÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?

COOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didnÃ¢ÂÂt talk while you talked.

CLINTON: Yes, thatÃ¢ÂÂs true, I didnÃ¢ÂÂt.

TRUMP: Because you have nothing to say.

CLINTON: I didnÃ¢ÂÂt in the first debate, and IÃ¢ÂÂm going to try not to in this debate, because IÃ¢ÂÂd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.

TRUMP: Get off this question.

CLINTON: OK, Donald. I know youÃ¢ÂÂre into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way itÃ¢ÂÂs exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But letÃ¢ÂÂs at least focusÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: LetÃ¢ÂÂs see what happensÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

COOPER: Allow her to respond.

CLINTON: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ on some of the issues that people care about tonight. LetÃ¢ÂÂs get to their questions.

COOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?

TRUMP: IÃ¢ÂÂd like to know, Anderson, why arenÃ¢ÂÂt you bringing up the e-mails? IÃ¢ÂÂd like to know. Why arenÃ¢ÂÂt you bringingÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: We brought up the e-mails.

TRUMP: No, it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt. It hasnÃ¢ÂÂt. And it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been finished at all.

COOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question.

TRUMP: ItÃ¢ÂÂs nice to Ã¢ÂÂ one on three.

QUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?

COOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.

CLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald.

TRUMP: No, IÃ¢ÂÂm a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.

(LAUGHTER)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say heÃ¢ÂÂs going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And IÃ¢ÂÂm going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and IÃ¢ÂÂve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.

But hereÃ¢ÂÂs what I donÃ¢ÂÂt want people to forget when weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt just that 20 million got insurance who didnÃ¢ÂÂt have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.

But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies canÃ¢ÂÂt deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.

Number three, women canÃ¢ÂÂt be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if youÃ¢ÂÂre under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didnÃ¢ÂÂt happen before.

So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But weÃ¢ÂÂve got to get costs down. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again.

Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the highest weÃ¢ÂÂve ever been in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up.

CLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.

COOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.

TRUMP: It is such a great question and itÃ¢ÂÂs maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. ItÃ¢ÂÂs going up at numbers that nobodyÃ¢ÂÂs ever seen worldwide. NobodyÃ¢ÂÂs ever seen numbers like this for health care.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs only getting worse. In Ã¢ÂÂ17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.

Obamacare will never work. ItÃ¢ÂÂs very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. ItÃ¢ÂÂs going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.

We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want Ã¢ÂÂ and President Obama and whoever was working on it Ã¢ÂÂ they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.

You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you havenÃ¢ÂÂt noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. ItÃ¢ÂÂs catastrophic in certain ways.

But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobodyÃ¢ÂÂs ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, youÃ¢ÂÂre never going to be able to use it.

COOPER: Mr. Trump, your timeÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, Ã¢ÂÂthe craziest thing in the world,Ã¢ÂÂ saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?

CLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And itÃ¢ÂÂs very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs where the vast majority of people get their health care.

And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldnÃ¢ÂÂt put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didnÃ¢ÂÂt have the money to afford insurance and didnÃ¢ÂÂt have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.

That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what DonaldÃ¢ÂÂs not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companiesÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: Secretary ClintonÃ¢ÂÂ¦

CLINTON: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry, youÃ¢ÂÂve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthmaÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: Your time is up.

CLINTON: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ you may not be able to have insurance because you canÃ¢ÂÂt afford it. So letÃ¢ÂÂs fix whatÃ¢ÂÂs broken about it, but letÃ¢ÂÂs not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not going to work.

COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. TRUMP: Well, I just want Ã¢ÂÂ just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everythingÃ¢ÂÂs broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.

COOPER: YouÃ¢ÂÂve said you want to end ObamacareÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: By the wayÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: YouÃ¢ÂÂve said you want to end Obamacare. YouÃ¢ÂÂve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if youÃ¢ÂÂre no longer mandating that every American get insurance?

TRUMP: WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to be able to. YouÃ¢ÂÂre going to have plansÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: What does that mean?

TRUMP: Well, IÃ¢ÂÂll tell you what it means. YouÃ¢ÂÂre going to have plans that are so good, because weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out Ã¢ÂÂ once we break out the lines and allow the competition to comeÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: Are you going Ã¢ÂÂ are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?

TRUMP: President Obama Ã¢ÂÂ Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said Ã¢ÂÂ he said it was a great lie, i"	0
123	"Fox News' Shepard Smith: 'Why is it lie after lie after lie?' on Russia meeting

Fox News host Shepard Smith slammed what he called ""lies"" and ""deception"" pushed by Donald Trump Jr. in a fiery Friday rant over emerging details of Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer last summer.

On Friday's Shepard Smith Reporting, the host launched into a tirade over Trump Jr.'s stance the meeting equated to nothing even as new details showed it included eight people. Several congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating whether Trump associates colluded with the Russians during the presidential campaign.

""We're still not clean on this, Chris,"" Smith told fellow Fox anchor Chris Wallace. ""Why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean.""

Smith, who has chided President Trump for his treatment of the media, continued.

""The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling,"" he said. ""And there are still people out there who believe we're making it up and one day they're going to realize we're not.""

The diatribe left Wallace speechless.

""I don't know what to say,"" he said. ""I think there's a lot of truth to everything you've said.""

Smith's statements quickly spread across the Internet, where some called for his firing.

Smith went on the offensive against Trump and his administration earlier this year. In February, Smith defended CNN as ""not fake news,"" an accusation often lobbed by the president and his supporters.

Three Democratic candidates participated in tonight's ABC presidential primary debate at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley.

Post staff annotations will appear by default; others are in a menu that you can see in the upper right when you click or tap on an annotation.

The debate began after ABC's Martha Raddatz and David Muir introduced the candidates.

Raddatz: Good evening to you all. The rules for tonight are very basic and have been agreed to by all three campaigns in advance. Candidates can take up to a minute-and-a-half to respond directly to a question. For a rebuttal, for a follow-up, 45 seconds will be allowed. There are green, yellow, and red lights that each candidate will see to signal when time is running out and when they're supposed to be finished with their answers.

MUIR: We will be tackling many critical issues right here tonight, and we begin with opening statements, in alphabetical order, and Secretary Clinton.

CLINTON: Well, thank you. And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.

You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top. That's the job. I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.

I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts. From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made. They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it. They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class. And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.

So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.

Thank you.

RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.

(APPLAUSE)

Governor O'Malley?

O'MALLEY: Martha, thank you. Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us. So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.

I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday. And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans. I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts. I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.

Advertisement

What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger. And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other. What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.

We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy. But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.

We are a better country than this. Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty. And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.

(APPLAUSE)

MUIR: Senator Sanders.

SANDERS: Good evening.

I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent. I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.

I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families. I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.

Advertisement

I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground. That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.

(APPLAUSE)

MUIR: Senator Sanders thank you and thank you all.

We do have a lot of important issues to get here tonight and we want to address the controversy of the last 24 hours right off the top because we heard some of the most heated rhetoric of the campaign so far between two of the campaigns on this stage tonight.

Senator Sanders, you fired a campaign staffer you have sued the Democratic National Committee; all of this after your campaign acknowledge that some of your staffers quote, ""irresponsibly accessed data from another campaign."" The Clinton campaign called this a very egregious breech of data of ethics and said, quote, ""our data was stolen.""

Advertisement

Did they overstate this or were your staffers essentially stealing part of the Clinton playbook?

SANDERS: David, let me give you a little bit of background here.

The DNC has hired vendors. On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago. Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign. And when our staffers said, ""whoa, what's going here?"" They went to the DNC quietly.

They went to the vendor and said, ""hey, something is wrong,"" and that was quietly dealt with. None of that information was looked at. Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.

A few days ago a similar incident happened. There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign. In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information. As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person. We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.

Advertisement

Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem. But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign. That is an egregious act. I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.

SANDERS: Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign. Don't know that.

But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.

Last point. When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it. And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.

Advertisement

MUIR: But Senator, you do mention the DNC -- the vender. But you said of your staff that they did the wrong thing.

SANDERS: Absolutely.

At ABC's Democratic presidential debate, candidate Bernie Sanders apologizes to rival Hillary Clinton for a scandal involving key voter data. (Video: ABC News)

MUIR: So, does Secretary Clinton deserve an apology tonight?

SANDERS: Yes, I apologize.

MUIR: Secretary Clinton...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters. This is not the type of campaign that we run.

And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.

MUIR: Secretary Clinton, he has apologized. How do your react?

CLINTON: I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie. It really is important that we go forward on this.

I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.

Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.

And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on. Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.

(APPLAUSE)

I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.

O'MALLEY: Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.

Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind. You want to know why things don't get done in Washington? Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.

Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth. Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.

We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table. And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.

(APPLAUSE)

MUIR (?): All three candidates are weighing in.

SANDERS: Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton. You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails. Right?

And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues. Media notwithstanding.

Those are the issues that the American people want discussed. I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.

MUIR: Good let's move on -- Senator Sanders, let's move on right to some of those issues.

(APPLAUSE)

It is just six days before Christmas, as we all know in this country. It's typically a joyful time, as it is this year, as well. But it's also an anxious time. President Obama has acknowledged that what we saw in San Bernardino was an act of terrorism. But we remember the president said, right before Thanksgiving, there is no known specific and credible intelligence indicating a plot on the homeland.

We now know that this couple had assembled an arsenal. They were not on law enforcement's radar. They were completely undetected. So as we approach another holiday, with the president again saying, late this week, no credible threat, Secretary Clinton, how confident should the American people be, that there aren't others like that couple right now in the U.S. going undetected?

And what would you do as president to find them?

CLINTON: Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.

I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS. Not to contain them, but to defeat them. And it has three parts. First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.

CLINTON: Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism. And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe. Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.

Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground. Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.

And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right. We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information. That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.

That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies. They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists. We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.

And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities. Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization. They will be our early warning signal. That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.

O'MALLEY: David, I am the very first...

MUIR: (inaudible) thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

I am the very first post-9/11 mayor and the very first post-9/11 governor. I understand, from the ground up, that when attacks like San Bernardino happen, when attacks like the attacks of 9/11 happen, that when people call 911, the first people to show up are the local first responders.

Many of the things Secretary Clinton said are absolutely true, but they underscore a lack of investment that we have, as a nation, failed to make over these last 15 years in intelligence gathering, intelligence analysis, intelligence sharing. Not only in theater, in Syria and Iraq and other places where we embalk (ph) ourselves in toppling dictators without having any idea what comes next, but here in the homeland, as we protect people from this threat of the lone wolves and these changing tactics and strategies.

I believe that what's happened here is that the president had us on the right course, but it's a lack of battle tempo. We have to increase the battle tempo, we have to bring a modern way of getting things done and forcing the sharing of information and do a much better job of acting on it in order to prevent these sorts of attacks in the future.

MUIR: And we're going to break down these issues tonight, but I do want to go to Senator Sanders because the concern going into Christmas is significant, as you know. A new ABC News poll shows 77 percent of Americans have little or no confidence in the government's ability to prevent a lone wolf attack. How would you specifically find would-be terrorist who are going undetected?

SANDERS: I'm one of the 77 percent. I think this is a very difficult issue. Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said. Let me tell you what I think we have got to do. I think it's a two-pronged issue.

Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS. What is the best way to do it? Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself. I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.

I do not believe in unilateral American action. I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations. I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan. This small country has welcomed in many refugees.

And Abdullah said something recently, very important. He said, ""Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam. We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."" And I believe he is absolutely right.

MUIR: Senator, thank you.

RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, in the wake of the San Bernardino attack, you all emphasized gun control. But our latest poll shows that more Americans believe arming people, not stricter gun laws, is the best defense against terrorism. Are they wrong?

CLINTON: Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us. Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take. You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that. We've got to build a coalition abroad. We also have to build a coalition at home. Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS. I know how hard that is. I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...

RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, can we stick to gun control?

CLINTON: Yes, I'm getting...

RADDATZ: Are they wrong?

CLINTON: ... I'm getting to that. Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home. Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer. We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.

I think what is...

(APPLAUSE)

Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country. The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community. People who we should be welcoming and working with.

I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a ""clash of civilizations,"" that there is some kind of Western plot or even ""war against Islam,"" which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization.

So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: Senator Sanders -- wait just a moment, please, Governor O'Malley.

Senator Sanders, we've seen those long lines of people buying guns in record numbers after the Paris attacks. Would you discourage people from buying a gun?

SANDERS: It's a country in which people choose to buy guns. I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners. That's the right of people.

But this is what I do believe. I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.

For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check. Who denies that it is crazy...

(APPLAUSE)

Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable? We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole. In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.

I think there is a consensus.

(APPLAUSE)

I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement. It's a divided country on guns. But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I, coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, will do my best to bring together.

O'MALLEY: Martha, if I may...

RADDATZ: Thank you, Senator Sanders.

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: I think we're going to go on...

O'MALLEY: Excuse me, no.

MUIR: Governor, we have to abide the rules here, we'll call on you here shortly, but...

O'MALLEY: I am the only person on this stage who has actually...

MUIR: But I do want pick up on something...

O'MALLEY: ... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.

And, look, there are profound differences...

(APPLAUSE)

O'MALLEY: Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill. Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers. And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.

Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.

Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls. We need more principle. When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up. We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.

RADDATZ: Governor, now -- and let me stay with gun control for a minute, then. You talk about assault weapons. Even if you were able to ban the purchase of assault weapons tomorrow, Americans already own an estimated 7 to 10 million semi-automatic rifles.

Would you make it illegal to own those weapons, force people to turn them in? And if not, how would banning the sales really make a difference?

O'MALLEY: Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons. You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...

RADDATZ: But, again, I'm not talking about buying. Would you have them confiscated? The ones that are already here?

O'MALLEY: No, Martha, I would not. And that's not what we did in Maryland. But you know what we did in Maryland? We overcame the NRA's objections. We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.

We did our own rallies. And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country. ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show.

And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.

SANDERS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.

CLINTON: Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin.

O'MALLEY: I am telling the truth.

SANDERS: First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.

MUIR: We will.

(LAUGHTER)

SANDERS: All right.

MUIR: But let me just establish that for you, senator. Really quickly governor, we are going to call on you tonight and it's very clear you have a lot to say but please wait until you're called upon. And senator, he invoked your record and I'll let you respond.

SANDERS: He sure did.

MUIR: I'll let you respond.

CLINTON: He invoked mine as well.

MUIR: And you will get some to as well.

SANDERS: Sure did. All right. First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus. In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House. We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race. One candidate said, you know what, I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly.

Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders. I lost that election by three percentage points. Quite likely, for that reason. So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.

(CROSSTALK)

Excuse me. Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.

(APPLAUSE)

MUIR: Senator, thank you. I want to move on here. Secretary Clinton, you brought up Donald Trump a short time ago.

CLINTON: I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well. I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures. And I applaud his record in Maryland. I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine. I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.

I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity. And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country. I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.

And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity. We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country. It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.

We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem. And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.

(APPLAUSE)

MUIR: Secretary Clinton, thank you. We're going to move on from guns here and go back to something you mentioned a short time ago. You brought up Donald Trump first here this evening. We've now seen the polling done well after his proposed ban on Muslims coming to America. Thirty-six percent of Americans, more than a third, agree with him.

You have weighed in already on Donald Trump. You've weighed in on the proposed ban. But what would you say to the millions of Americans watching tonight who agree with him? Are they wrong?

CLINTON: Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing. First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino. And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.

So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face. We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear. Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help.

CLINTON: You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks. One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together. You are not our adversary, you are our partner.

And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears. He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists. So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.

MUIR: Secretary, thank you.

Senator Sanders, I did want to ask you about a neighbor in San Bernardino who reportedly witnessed packages being delivered to that couple's home, that it set off red flags, but they didn't report it because they were afraid to profile. What would you say to Americans afraid to profile? Is it ever acceptable?

SANDERS: Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it. That's kind of a no-brainer. You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911. Do it.

(LAUGHTER)

MUIR: But I'm asking about -- I'm asking about profiling. Because a lot of people are afraid of that.

SANDERS: But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points. What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.

The secretary is right: Our people are fearful. They are anxious on a number of levels. They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America. We all understand that.

But you know what else they're anxious about? They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent. And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it? What are you going to do for my kids?

And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, ""I know the answers. The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans. Those are your enemies. We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists. We've got to hate the Muslims."" Meanwhile, the rich get richer.

So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea. He thinks low wages are a good idea.

I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from. Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.

(APPLAUSE)

MUIR: Senator, thank you.

RADDATZ: I want to move to another...

O'MALLEY: Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: No, no, not yet, Governor O'Malley.

O'MALLEY: Can I share this quick story?

RADDATZ: No, not yet, Governor O'Malley.

O'MALLEY: Oh. All right.

RADDATZ: I'll come to you when we call on you. Thank you very much.

O'MALLEY: When you come back to me, I'll share that story.

RADDATZ: You'll be happy. I'll let -- I'll let you talk then.

Secretary Clinton, I want to talk about a new terrorist tool used in the Paris attacks, encryption. FBI Director James Comey says terrorists can hold secret communications which law enforcement cannot get to, even with a court order.

You've talked a lot about bringing tech leaders and government officials together, but Apple CEO Tim Cook said removing encryption tools from our products altogether would only hurt law-abiding citizens who rely on us to protect their data. So would you force him to give law enforcement a key to encrypted technology by making it law?

CLINTON: I would not want to go to that point. I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitim"	0
128	"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption

You might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.

New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, canÃ¢ÂÂt be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.

Where do these horses come from?

While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.

Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico Ã¢ÂÂ and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.

Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.

Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.

Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. DonÃ¢ÂÂt let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it Ã¢ÂÂ because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.

129	"What this plan will do is to make the insurance you have work better for you. Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. As soon as I sign this bill, it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it most. They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a lifetime. We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they get sick. And insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies Ã¢ÂÂ because there's no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse. That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives.

That's what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan Ã¢ÂÂ more security and stability.

Now, if you're one of the tens of millions of Americans who don't currently have health insurance, the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality, affordable choices. If you lose your job or change your job, you will be able to get coverage. If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you will be able to get coverage. We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange Ã¢ÂÂ a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices. Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers. As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage. This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance. It's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance. And it's time to give every American the same opportunity that we've given ourselves.

For those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower-priced insurance available in the exchange, we will provide tax credits, the size of which will be based on your need. And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned. This exchange will take effect in four years, which will give us time to do it right. In the meantime, for those Americans who can't get insurance today because they have pre-existing medical conditions, we will immediately offer low-cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill. This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign, it's a good idea now, and we should embrace it.

Now, even if we provide these affordable options, there may be those Ã¢ÂÂ particularly the young and healthy Ã¢ÂÂ who still want to take the risk and go without coverage. There may still be companies that refuse to do right by their workers. The problem is, such irresponsible behavior costs all the rest of us money. If there are affordable options and people still don't sign up for health insurance, it means we pay for those people's expensive emergency room visits. If some businesses don't provide workers health care, it forces the rest of us to pick up the tab when their workers get sick, and gives those businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors. And unless everybody does their part, many of the insurance reforms we seek Ã¢ÂÂ especially requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions Ã¢ÂÂ just can't be achieved."	0

10 things you should know about John McCain (but probably don't):

John McCain voted against establishing a national holiday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Now he says his position has ""evolved,"" yet he's continued to oppose key civil rights laws.1 According to Bloomberg News, McCain is more hawkish than Bush on Iraq, Russia and China. Conservative columnist Pat Buchanan says McCain ""will make Cheney look like Gandhi.""2 His reputation is built on his opposition to torture, but McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban.3

McCain opposes a woman's right to choose. He said, ""I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.""4 The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill.5 He's one of the richest people in a Senate filled with millionaires. The Associated Press reports he and his wife own at least eight homes! Yet McCain says the solution to the housing crisis is for people facing foreclosure to get a ""second job"" and skip their vacations.6 Many of McCain's fellow Republican senators say he's too reckless to be commander in chief. One Republican senator said: ""The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine. He's erratic. He's hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.""7 McCain talks a lot about taking on special interests, but his campaign manager and top advisers are actually lobbyists. The government watchdog group Public Citizen says McCain has 59 lobbyists raising money for his campaign, more than any of the other presidential candidates.8 McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years. The pastor McCain calls his ""spiritual guide,"" Rod Parsley, believes America's founding mission is to destroy Islam, which he calls a ""false religion."" McCain sought the political support of right-wing preacher John Hagee, who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church ""the Antichrist"" and a ""false cult.""9 He positions himself as pro-environment, but he scored a 0Ã¢ÂÂyes, zeroÃ¢ÂÂfrom the League of Conservation Voters last year.10

John McCain is not who the Washington press corps make him out to be. Please help get the word outÃ¢ÂÂforward this email to your personal network. And if you want us to keep you posted on MoveOn's work to get the truth out about John McCain, sign up here:

Rather than face the backlash and vindictive response from the Trump administration to his requests to play ball, Franken will resign, deny all of the allegations and spend the next 7 1/2 years under investigation by Trey Gowdy.

This was a great move by Trump. Not only does he get rid of a huge political opponent, he shows America that our elected officials can be compromised and forced to do as theyÃ¢ÂÂre told. No more of this pussyfooting around with majority votes and filibustersÃ¢ÂÂ¦either get in line of get out.

One of these days the Democrats will realize they canÃ¢ÂÂt keep up with the winning strategy of the Republican party. It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt matter how many more votes the Dems get, the GOP continues to grow stronger. With Schumer out of the way it will grow even stronger. The alleged file on Franken includes things like pushing entitlement programs that are meant to give away free stuff for votes and adultery.

President Trump doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mess around.

The shooting of Harris County Precinct 3 Assistant Chief Deputy Clinton Greenwood did not appear to be random, according to Baytown police Lt. Steve Dorris, but a motive was not immediately clear.

Ã¢ÂÂWhether or not he was specifically targeted, or whether this was because of the uniform he was wearing or the place he pulled up to in the morning, we just donÃ¢ÂÂt know that right now,Ã¢ÂÂ Dorris said.

No arrests had been made as of Monday evening. Dorris said authorities were still Ã¢ÂÂactively investigatingÃ¢ÂÂ the shooting."	1

136	"Twitter Caught Leaking Donald Trump's Private Messages in Undercover Sting

Senior Twitter engineer caught on video boasting during Project Veritas investigation

ÃÂ© Neon Nettle / YouTube An investigation by Project Veritas found Twitter is leaking Donald Trump's private data

An undercover investigation by Project Veritas has uncovered mass political bias at the highest levels of Twitter.

One of Twitter's senior engineers has admitted to hacking the president's private data and leaking it to the Department of Justice to ""help with their little investigation.""

The high-level engineer, Clay Haynes, a self-confessed ""bleeding-heart liberal,"" boasted to covert investigators that his team can access all activity of every user on the site, and can even retrieve deleted messages.

After confessing that the social media sites extreme monitoring of its users was ""big brother-ish,"" he admitted that Twitter disclosed all of Donald Trump's messages to the DOJ, saying:

""Even the ones heÃ¢ÂÂs deleted, any direct messages""

ÃÂ© Youtube The investigation into Twitter was conducted by Project Veritas

A Project Veritas undercover investigation has revealed a senior network security engineer at Twitter stating that his company is Ã¢ÂÂmore than happyÃ¢ÂÂ to turn over the private communications and deleted tweets of President Donald Trump to the Department of Justice.

If true, it is yet unknown whether Twitter is voluntarily disclosing this sensitive information or acting under a court order.

Twitter is currently in the midst of defending itself from left-leaning criticism that President Trump hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been removed from the enormous media platform for violations of TwitterÃ¢ÂÂs Terms of Service.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Clay Haynes has been employed by Twitter since September 2016. On January 3, 2018, he met with a Project Veritas undercover journalist (UCJ) at Stookey's Club Moderne in San Francisco.

Using a hidden video camera, the Veritas UCJ captures Haynes stating that Ã¢ÂÂweÃ¢ÂÂre more than happy to help the DOJ with their little investigationÃ¢ÂÂ of President Trump.

When prompted by the UCJ, Mr. Haynes provides additional details, Ã¢ÂÂBasically, giving them every single tweet that heÃ¢ÂÂs posted. Even the ones heÃ¢ÂÂs deleted, any direct messages, any mentionsÃ¢ÂÂ¦Ã¢ÂÂ

ÃÂ© Youtube Clay Haynes boasts that Twitter can access anyone's private data

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ¦heÃ¢ÂÂs dangerous, I donÃ¢ÂÂt like him and heÃ¢ÂÂs a terrible human being and I want to get rid of him,Ã¢ÂÂ the self-described bleeding-heart liberal Haynes says in the video about President Trump.

Ã¢ÂÂIn fact, we had internal reviews about thatÃ¢ÂÂ¦Ã¢ÂÂ

On January 7, 2018, James OÃ¢ÂÂKeefe himself went undercover with Haynes at MortonÃ¢ÂÂs Steakhouse in San Francisco to confirm if Twitter was working with the Department of Justice to hand over TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs tweets and DMs.

When pressed about looking at Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs messages, Haynes explained: Ã¢ÂÂWe have a subpoena process for that very reason.Ã¢ÂÂ

The conversation continued:

James OÃ¢ÂÂKeefe: Ã¢ÂÂAre you working with DOJ currently on that?Ã¢ÂÂ Clay Haynes: Ã¢ÂÂI canÃ¢ÂÂt comment, even if I knew, I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt comment.Ã¢ÂÂ

ÃÂ© Youtube Twitter has access to all user's private data according to Haynes

Ã¢ÂÂThe fact is, even if Haynes was just speculating about helping Justice, his admission shows a clear and dangerous political bias at the highest levels of Twitter,Ã¢ÂÂ says Project Veritas founder and President James OÃ¢ÂÂKeefe in the video.

Ã¢ÂÂThe question is: by Twitter giving private information about the President to the Justice Department, are they breaking the law, betraying a trust, following an official request or satisfying a political agenda by leading a crusade against the President.Ã¢ÂÂ

Describing himself as the bouncer of the network, Mr. Haynes also details the level of information Twitter retains in its databases about their hundreds of millions of users.

The Project Veritas Twitter investigation is the fourth installment of its American Pravda series.

In Part I, Veritas disclosed that CNN's Russia coverage is driven by ratings and a political agenda, but in reality, using the words of CNN Political Commentator Van Jones is just a Ã¢ÂÂnothing burger.Ã¢ÂÂ

Part II disclosed a political bias at The New York Times which forced executive responses and an immediate change of their social media policy.

Part III exposed political bias at The Washington Post and brought to light that the far-reaching narratives of the paperÃ¢ÂÂs editorial board are not rooted in the factual findings of their subject-matter expert reporters.

137	"One of the most contentious issues in the State of MissouriÃ¢ÂÂs case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.

A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.

The defense teamÃ¢ÂÂs April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.

When the defense counsel asked K.S., Ã¢ÂÂDid you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?Ã¢ÂÂ she answered: Ã¢ÂÂNot to my knowledge. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt see him with it.Ã¢ÂÂ

The question was then asked, Ã¢ÂÂAnd as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera Ã¢ÂÂ with a camera or a phone?Ã¢ÂÂ

K.S. replied, Ã¢ÂÂCorrect.Ã¢ÂÂ

The counsel then asked, Ã¢ÂÂAnd you canÃ¢ÂÂt say you saw it on his person, you canÃ¢ÂÂt say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?Ã¢ÂÂ

K.S. answered, Ã¢ÂÂYes. I cannot say.Ã¢ÂÂ

Trying to salvage the stateÃ¢ÂÂs case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., Ã¢ÂÂDid you see what you believed to be a phone?Ã¢ÂÂ

Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ¦ I havenÃ¢ÂÂt talked about it because I donÃ¢ÂÂt know if itÃ¢ÂÂs because IÃ¢ÂÂm remembering it through a dream or I Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I havenÃ¢ÂÂt spoken about it because of that.Ã¢ÂÂ

K.S. remembered the photo incident Ã¢ÂÂthrough a dreamÃ¢ÂÂ? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.

As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.Ã¢ÂÂs recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.

Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it."	1

Announces His Candidacy Washington DC - April 17, 2006 We have a great country. We can do better. We must embrace our Founders intentions that we evolve our democracy to remain true to its founding principles. Lincoln, 140 years ago, defined our government: Ã¢ÂÂof the People, by the People, and for the People.Ã¢ÂÂ It falls to us to now give full meaning to a Government Ã¢ÂÂby the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂ so our common wisdom is reflected in our national policies. TodayÃ¢ÂÂs advances in information and communication technology provide us unprecedented ability to communicate as citizens, and all that is lacking is a political process, a mechanism, that permits the citizens to play a direct role in the operations of government. Our country needs a renewalÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂrenewal not just of particular policies, or of particular people, but of democracy itself. I believe that the remedy for the state of our political alienation is the civic renewal embodied in the Ã¢ÂÂNational Initiative for Democracy.Ã¢ÂÂ The National Initiative is proposed legislation that colleagues and I have developed over the last fifteen years. The National InitiativeÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂwhen enacted into lawÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂwill bring all American citizens into the operations of government as lawmakers. Our three branches of government have become like an unstable chair with only three legs. The Founders could not have envisioned how much money and special interests would corrupt our political process. Giving usÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂAmerican citizensÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂlegislative power will put the fourth leg on our chair, giving birth to a new foundation of American governanceÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂadding a new check to our system of Checks and Balances. I believe the internet adage: Ã¢ÂÂall of us together are smarter than any one of us alone. I say: Ã¢ÂÂLet the People Decide.Ã¢ÂÂ Lawmaking is the central power of government not Election Day voting. Politicians have purposely made the electoral process uncompetitive and jealously guard their monopoly on lawmaking. Whoever makes the laws determines who we vote for, when we vote and how we voteÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂFlorida and Ohio are recent examples. Representative government is mired in a culture of lies and corruption. The corrupting influence of money has created a class of professional politicians raising huge sums to maintain power. Then politicians legislate in the interests of corporations and interest groups. Are todayÃ¢ÂÂs political leaders more corrupt than earlier generations? I do not think so. Most men and women in public service begin with a dedication to the public good. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the power that corrupts them. Throwing the rascals out Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂRepublicans or Democrats or any party for that matterÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂmay make us feel good but reshuffling the deck wonÃ¢ÂÂt make any difference. We hope against hope that our representatives will correct and reform government. But itÃ¢ÂÂs like asking the foxes to redesign the chicken-coop. The flaws of representative government arenÃ¢ÂÂt in either in the structure of representative government or with those who manage it. ItÃ¢ÂÂs both. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the structure of representative government that makes its managers susceptible to corruption, greed, injustice and self serving interests. Continued on page 2 Stay up to date, enter your email and zip code: Email : Zip : A 21st Century Government We are a great nationÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂblessed with ideal geography and abundant resources developed by the sacrifices of immigrant peoples who came to our shores from all over the world, melding foreign cultures and political and religious beliefs into a national community of diversity, liberty, laws and free markets. Our political and economic achievements inspired respect and admiration worldwide. That respect and admiration has been squandered by our current partisan, political leadership. Today, the United States government and the president are reviled in many parts of the world. Not only have we failed as a world leader but our domestic stewardship has presided over a crumbling national infrastructure and unmet social needs while undermining the soundness of our economy with government profligacy. Unfortunately, the partisan, political rhetoric we hear as we approach the 2006 election ineffectively nibbles at the margins of domestic issues and defers submissively to an imperial presidency on global matters. Unfortunately, the monopoly power representatives have thwarts any possibly of reforming government. Representative government, by its very structure, is susceptible to corruption, greed, unfairness, injustice and self-serving special interests. There are only two venues in human governance within which change is possible: the people or the government (that the people set up in the Constitution). Since the government venue is responsible for our current predicament, we have no choice but to look to the venue of the people to reform the government. We need to change the direction of the United States if we are to meet the social, technological, environmental and global challenges of the 21st Century."	0
140	"Washington, DC - U.S. Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the full Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education FY08 Appropriations Bill which includes $1,000,000 for Bethel Performing Arts and $300,000 for SUNY New Paltz. The bill will now proceed to the Senate Floor as the next step in the appropriations process. Schumer and Clinton worked closely with members of the Appropriations Committee to include funding for the project in this yearÃ¢ÂÂs spending bill.

Ã¢ÂÂThis is great news for the Hudson Valley,Ã¢ÂÂ said Schumer. Ã¢ÂÂThese projects are designed to strengthen various aspects of the community from encouraging the arts to creating stronger and more specialized academic programs for our students. I will work hard to continue to secure funding for these critical programs.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThese are welcome investments for the Hudson Valley,Ã¢ÂÂ said Senator Clinton. Ã¢ÂÂThese funds will help the for the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts continue to promote education, the arts, culture and tourism in the region and will help SUNY New Paltz continue its world class curriculum for students.Ã¢ÂÂ

Bethel Performing Arts will use $1,000,000 in federal funds to purchase and borrow of exhibits at the non-for-profit museum. Exhibits will focus on the post-WWII period and cultural, political, social, and significant historic events during this period including, in particular, the period of the 1960Ã¢ÂÂs and its continuing legacy. This museum aims at advancing education, the arts, and culture in the surrounding upstate New York region. Funds will also be used for the development and creation of the audio-visual presentations, computer interactive displays, and films, and all licensing and similar matters and related costs and expenses.

SUNY New Paltz will use $300,000 in federal funds for curriculum development in economic development and governance.

Now that the bill has been approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee, it will be sent to the Senate floor. Following approval by the Senate, the bill will move towards Conference with the House and then to the President for signature.

Washington, D.C.

12:03 P.M. EDT

MR. HARWOOD: Good afternoon from Washington, D.C. I'm John Harwood. It is noon on the East Coast. The Dow Jones average stands around 10,700 points; 15 million Americans are out of work. And we're spending the next hour talking about how to fix the troubled American economy.

Please welcome the President of the United States. (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.

MR. HARWOOD: Mr. President, thanks for being here.

THE PRESIDENT: That was quite a lead-in, by the way. (Laughter.)

MR. HARWOOD: Yes, wasnÃ¢ÂÂt it? You like that dramatic pause? (Laughter.) We have got a cross-section of people from around the country -- CEOs, union workers, teachers and students --

THE PRESIDENT: ItÃ¢ÂÂs a good-looking group, I have to say. (Laughter and applause.)

MR. HARWOOD: -- small business owners, people who don't have a job. Every one of them has a stake in the American Dream. And they got some good news over the weekend. The National Bureau of Economic Research, as you know, has said that the recession ended in June 2009 -- a few months after you took office. And yet hereÃ¢ÂÂs the problem you find yourself with. Many leaders in business think you and your policies are hostile to them. And many ordinary Americans think your policies are helping Wall Street and big business. How did that happen?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, even though economists may say that the recession officially ended last year, obviously for the millions of people who are still out of work, people who have seen their home values decline, people who are struggling to pay the bills day to day, itÃ¢ÂÂs still very real for them.

And I think we have to go back to what was happening when I was first sworn in as the 44th President of the United States. We went through the worst recession since the Great Depression. Nothing has come close. In fact, if you look at the consequences of the recession in the Ã¢ÂÂ80s, the recession in the Ã¢ÂÂ90s, and the recession in 2001, and you combine all three of those, it still wasnÃ¢ÂÂt as bad as this recession that we went through.

So the month I was sworn in we lost 750,000 jobs; the month after that 600,000; the month after that 600,000. This is before any of our plans had a chance to take effect. The financial markets were on the verge of meltdown and the economy was contracting about 6 percent -- by far, the largest contraction we've seen since the Ã¢ÂÂ30s.

You combine all that and what that meant was that we had to take some steps very quickly just to make sure that the financial system was not collapsing -- that people could get auto loans, could get student loans, that businesses large and small could get some financing to keep their doors open and to keep their payrolls on track. And in addition, we had to make sure that we didnÃ¢ÂÂt slip into a Great Depression.

Now, we've done that. Those programs that we put in place worked. So now youÃ¢ÂÂve got a financial system that is stable. ItÃ¢ÂÂs still not as strong as it was back in 2006, 2007, but it is stabilized. YouÃ¢ÂÂve got now eight consecutive months of private sector job growth. Businesses are able to borrow again; theyÃ¢ÂÂre investing again; theyÃ¢ÂÂre making profits again.

That's all the good news. The challenge is, is that the hole was so deep that a lot of people out there are still hurting -- and probably some folks here in the audience are still having a tough time. (Applause.) And so the question then becomes what can we now put in place to make sure that the trend lines continue in a positive direction, as opposed to going back in the negative direction.

Last week we got some good news. After fighting for several months, we finally got a small business tax cut bill in place so that weÃ¢ÂÂre eliminating capital gains for small businesses and startups, making sure that they can get loans -- because small businesses are the ones that have been hardest hit in terms of not being able to get capital. We have put forward proposals, for example, to accelerate investment here in the United States instead of overseas in research and development and plants and equipment that could put people back to work.

So there are a lot of plans in place that can make improvement, but itÃ¢ÂÂs slow and steady, as opposed to the kind of quick fix that I think a lot of people would like to see. But the thing IÃ¢ÂÂve just got to remind people of is the fact that it took us a decade to get into the problem that weÃ¢ÂÂre in right now.

The Wall Street Journal came out with a report based on Census information that the years from 2001 to 2009, the middle class actually saw their wages decline by 5 percent. This was before the financial crisis. So these have been some long-term trends of the middle class having a lot of problems out there. And what weÃ¢ÂÂve got to do now it to reverse it, but something that took 10 years to create is going to take a little more time to solve.

MR. HARWOOD: IÃ¢ÂÂve heard you give that turnaround message you just gave many times.

THE PRESIDENT: Right, right.

MR. HARWOOD: Let me ask about your assessment of the challenge and the problem in communicating that to the American people. We all identify with people like ourselves. Do you think itÃ¢ÂÂs possible that because of your style, or the unusual things about your background -- your racial heritage, where you grew up, Ivy League education -- that the fearful voters who are about to go to the polls in November think, yes, I hear him, he may get it intellectually, but he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt feel what IÃ¢ÂÂm feeling?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, hereÃ¢ÂÂs my suspicion. I think that when the unemployment rate is still high and people are having a tough time, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt matter if I was green -- (laughter) -- it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt matter if I was purple. I think people would still be frustrated, and understandably so.

Look, I can describe whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening to the economy overall, but if youÃ¢ÂÂre out of work right now, the only thing that youÃ¢ÂÂre going to be hearing is, when do I get a job? (Applause.) If youÃ¢ÂÂre about to lose your home, all youÃ¢ÂÂre thinking about is, when can I get my home?

So I donÃ¢ÂÂt think that those are the issues. And by the way, I think most people understand -- because I spent two years running around the country talking about my life and why I was running for President -- they understand that I was the kid of a single mom, and I got my education through scholarships, and I lived in a small apartment with my grandparents, and they were helped by the G.I. Bill and FHA in terms of being able to climb into the middle class.

The whole reason I ran was because my life is a testimony to the American Dream. And everything that weÃ¢ÂÂve been doing since I came into office is designed to make sure that that American Dream continues for future generations.

I think the challenge right now is that IÃ¢ÂÂm thinking about the next generation and there are a lot of folks out there who are thinking about the next election. If I were making decisions based on November, then I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have done some of the things that I did because I knew they werenÃ¢ÂÂt popular. But they were the right thing to do. And that's got to be my top priority. (Applause.)

MR. HARWOOD: LetÃ¢ÂÂs go to the real jury who will decide whether they were the right things to do with an audience question right here.

Q Thank you very much and, quite frankly, good afternoon, President Obama. I am deeply honored to finally be in this forum, and so grateful for CNBC making the forum available so that you can speak to American citizens just like myself.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you.

Q I am a chief financial officer for a veterans service organization, AmVets here in Washington. IÃ¢ÂÂm also a mother, IÃ¢ÂÂm a wife, IÃ¢ÂÂm an American veteran, and IÃ¢ÂÂm one of your middle-class Americans. And quite frankly, IÃ¢ÂÂm exhausted. IÃ¢ÂÂm exhausted of defending you, defending your administration, defending the mantle of change that I voted for --

THE PRESIDENT: Right.

Q -- and deeply disappointed with where we are right now.

I have been told that I voted for a man who said he was going to change things in a meaningful way for the middle class. IÃ¢ÂÂm one of those people, and IÃ¢ÂÂm waiting, sir. IÃ¢ÂÂm waiting. I don't feel it yet. And I thought, while it wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be in great measure, I would feel it in some small measure.

I have two children in private school. And the financial recession has taken an enormous toll on my family. My husband and I joked for years that we thought we were well beyond the hot dogs and beans era of our lives.

THE PRESIDENT: Right.

Q But quite frankly, itÃ¢ÂÂs starting to knock on our door and ring true that that might be where weÃ¢ÂÂre headed again. And quite frankly, Mr. President, I need you to answer this honestly, is this my new reality?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I think that you describe exactly what is the bedrock of America -- a veteran whoÃ¢ÂÂs working for veterans, somebody who is a CFO and I am sure knows how to manage their money, have made good decisions.

Q Sometimes. (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: IÃ¢ÂÂm not saying once in a while you don't want to get a new pair of shoes. (Laughter.)

Q Today. (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: So the life you describe -- one of responsibility, looking after your family, contributing back to your community -- that's what we want to reward.

Now, as I said before, times are tough for everybody right now, so I understand your frustration. But I would just -- when you say there are things that youÃ¢ÂÂd like to see happen or youÃ¢ÂÂre hoping to see happen that havenÃ¢ÂÂt happened yet, let me just give you a couple of examples.

I right now have two children -- it sounds like youÃ¢ÂÂve got kids, as well.

Q Two girls.

THE PRESIDENT: Two girls. YouÃ¢ÂÂre going to be thinking about college soon.

Q Next year.

THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Now part of what we did over the last year and a half is to make sure that billions of dollars that were going to subsidize financial service industries under the federal student loan programs are now going to be going directly to students so that millions more students are going to be able to get loans and grants and scholarships to go to college. Now, that's going to have an impact on a whole bunch of kids out there, including maybe yours.

If you have a credit card, which I assume, you do --

Q No.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, see, now youÃ¢ÂÂre really -- now youÃ¢ÂÂve shown how responsible you are. (Laughter.) But if you have a mortgage or a credit card or any kind of financial dealings out there, as a consequence of the changes we made, the credit card companies canÃ¢ÂÂt increase your interest rate without notifying you, and they canÃ¢ÂÂt increase your interest rate on your previous balances. In terms of getting a mortgage, they -- you canÃ¢ÂÂt have a mortgage broker steer you to a mortgage that ultimately is going to cost you more money, because maybe theyÃ¢ÂÂre getting a financial incentive to do so. Those things are now against the law. So there are a whole host of protections in there.

You are a parent who has children -- if your child, heaven forbid, had a preexisting condition, before I took office, you were out of luck in terms of being able to get health insurance for that child. Now, insurance companies have to give you health insurance for that child, and by the way, that health insurance canÃ¢ÂÂt drop you if you get sick.

So there are a whole host of things that weÃ¢ÂÂve put in place that do make your life better. But the bottom line is if your 401(K) is still down substantially from where it was a while back, if you havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen a raise in a long time, if your home value went down --

Q Keep going. (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: -- depending on where you live, all those things still make you feel like, gosh, IÃ¢ÂÂm treading water.

Q Still struggling -- that's right.

THE PRESIDENT: And so my goal here is not to try to convince you that everything is where it needs to be. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not. That's why I ran for President. But what I am saying is, is that weÃ¢ÂÂre moving in the right direction. And if we are able to keep our eye on our long-term goal -- which is making sure that every family out there, if theyÃ¢ÂÂre middle class, that they can pay their bills, have the security of health insurance, retire with dignity and respect, send their kids to college; if theyÃ¢ÂÂre not yet in the middle class, that there are ladders there to get into the middle class, if people work hard and get an education to apply themselves -- that's our goal. That's the America we believe in. And I think that we are on track to be able to do that.

MR. HARWOOD: Mr. President, let me go at this from a different direction, from the direction of psychology, business confidence. You just mentioned things that credit card companies and health insurance companies used to do. There are some people in business who think, to use a phrase that you used recently about your critics, who think you talk about them like dogs. LetÃ¢ÂÂs listen to Ken Langone, a billionaire businessman.

THE PRESIDENT: IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry, billionaire businessman?

MR. HARWOOD: Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: Okay.

(Video is shown.)

MR. LANGONE: What should they stop doing? Well, I think the one thing to do is to not make people in business feel like weÃ¢ÂÂre villains or criminals or doing something wrong. I think anytime we can create a job that puts somebody to work, the country is better served. So I think that thereÃ¢ÂÂs got to be a need to understand that America, our democracy, is based on a strong, vibrant private economy.

MR. HARWOOD: Are you vilifying business?

THE PRESIDENT: Absolutely not. Look, letÃ¢ÂÂs look at the track record here. When I came into office, businesses, some of the same commentators who are on CNBC, were crying, Ã¢ÂÂDo something,Ã¢ÂÂ -- because as a consequence of reckless decisions that had been made, the economy was on the verge of collapse. Those same businesses now are profitable. The financial markets are stabilized. We havenÃ¢ÂÂt increased taxes on businesses. Actually, we have instituted about 50 tax cuts, many of them going to businesses large and small.

And so the only thing that weÃ¢ÂÂve said is that weÃ¢ÂÂve got to make sure that weÃ¢ÂÂre not doing some of the same things that we were doing in the past that got us into this mess in the first place.

So when I mentioned, for example, changes in the financial services industry, it is very important for us not to find ourselves in a position in which banks get too big to fail, and if they make bad decisions taxpayers have to bail them out or we let the entire economy collapse. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not a choice that I want any future President to have to make. And we instituted those changes.

And the fact is that when FDR put in place deposit insurance in banks, banks said at the time, this is going to destroy capitalism. When Medicare was instituted, there were a whole bunch of people who said, this is socialized medicine. Now we take it for granted. But oftentimes thereÃ¢ÂÂs this response that somehow these modest reforms that make the free market work better for consumers and for workers as well as for businesses, on the front end are resisted.

MR. HARWOOD: Let me take it, though, to a level that's beyond policy and it goes to what you value and you don't value.

THE PRESIDENT: Sure.

MR. HARWOOD: I think some of those in business may think that deep down you think that working for profit is morally inferior to the kind of work you used to do as a community organizer. Is that how you feel?

THE PRESIDENT: No, it isnÃ¢ÂÂt. Look, in every speech, every interview that I've made, I've constantly said that what sets America apart, what has made us successful over the long term, is we've got the most dynamic free market economy in the world. And that has to be preserved. That has to be preserved. We benefit from entrepreneurs and innovators who are going out there and creating jobs, creating businesses.

Government can't create the majority of jobs. And in fact, we want to get out of the way of folks whoÃ¢ÂÂve got a great idea and want to run with it and are going to be putting people to work.

MR. HARWOOD: Maybe we've got one of those people right here.

THE PRESIDENT: I'd love to hear from him.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. I'm 30 years old. I recently graduated from law school. And I went back to law school in order to pursue a life of public service, like you have. And what I found was that I simply -- there aren't jobs out there right now. I took advantage of the loans that you were just speaking about, but I can't make the interest payments on those loans today, let alone think about getting a mortgage, having a family, having even a marriage -- itÃ¢ÂÂs awfully expensive. (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to comment on that. (Laughter and applause.) Let me just say that whatever the expense, itÃ¢ÂÂs worth it. (Laughter.) I want that on record. (Applause.)

Q Like a lot of people in my generation, I was really inspired by you and by your campaign and message that you brought, and that inspiration is dying away. It feels like the American Dream is not attainable to a lot of us. And what I'm really hoping to hear from you is several concrete steps that youÃ¢ÂÂre going to take moving forward that will be able to re-ignite my generation, re-ignite the youth who are beset by student loans. And I really want to know, is the American Dream dead for me?

THE PRESIDENT: Absolutely not. Look, we still have the best universities in the world. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got the most dynamic private sector in the world. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got the most productive workers in the world. There is not a country in the world that would not want to change places with us. For all the problems that weÃ¢ÂÂve got, as tough as things are right now, we are still the country that billions of people around the world look to and aspire to. And I want everybody to always remember that.

Now, as I said before, what we saw happening during 2001 to the time I took office was wages actually declining for middle-class families, people treading water, young people having more trouble getting their foot in the door in terms of businesses. And so we are now having to go back to the fundamentals that made America great.

And that means weÃ¢ÂÂve got to improve our education system. That means that we have to make sure that our markets are working in a way that is good for a broad base of people and not just a narrow base of people. It means that, letÃ¢ÂÂs say -- you used the example of student loans -- one of the things that I just mentioned was, is that we put billions of dollars more into student loans. This was paid for, now. We took this out of financial service industries that were getting essentially unjustified subsidies -- theyÃ¢ÂÂre now going to students so that your debt would be lower. And by the way, part of that law also capped your debt at 10 percent of your income so that you knew that you could actually afford to take out this debt and pay for it even if you had a modest salary.



So we are taking these steps. But the most important thing we can do right now is to grow our economy. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the single most important thing that we can do. And some of the measures that weÃ¢ÂÂve put forward and IÃ¢ÂÂm going to be fighting for are designed to exactly do that.

For example, weÃ¢ÂÂve said letÃ¢ÂÂs accelerate business investment in the year 2011 to give a further jumpstart to the economy. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs something that, by the way, doesnÃ¢ÂÂt add to the deficit necessarily long term because this is depreciation that could be taken in the out-years. WeÃ¢ÂÂre just saying you invest now, you can take it now. And that gives businesses incentives to do it.

We want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing in research and development here in the United States because the key to our long-term growth is technology and innovation. And if we can get more of those investments here, that's going to improve. The reforms weÃ¢ÂÂve made on education -- which, by the way, have received bipartisan support -- are designed to make sure weÃ¢ÂÂve got the best engineers and the best scientists in the world right here in the United States.

So if weÃ¢ÂÂre doing all those things, I am confident that the American Dream will continue for the next generation. What we canÃ¢ÂÂt do, though, is go back to the same old things that we were doing, because weÃ¢ÂÂve been putting off these problems for decades. And that is something that I refuse to do.

MR. HARWOOD: Mr. President, let me ask you a question about course correction. Sometimes a leader, even if you think youÃ¢ÂÂve done the right things, but if the people youÃ¢ÂÂre trying to lead don't think so, youÃ¢ÂÂve got to somehow accommodate that, just like you would in a relationship. He was talking about marriage. (Laughter.)

As you go forward, is there any way in which you want to signal to the American people that youÃ¢ÂÂre going to change your approach? And specifically -- weÃ¢ÂÂre coming up to the midterm election -- have you asked your Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and your top economic advisor Larry Summers to stay with you through the end of your term, or might you make some changes?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I have not made any determinations about personnel. I think Larry Summers and Tim Geithner have done an outstanding job, as have my whole economic team. This is tough, the work that they do. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve been at it for two years, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to have a whole range of decisions about family that will factor into this, as well. But the bottom line is, is that weÃ¢ÂÂre constantly thinking, is what weÃ¢ÂÂre doing working as well as it could? Do we have other options and other alternatives that we can explore?

I think one of the things that's on a lot of peopleÃ¢ÂÂs minds right now, obviously, for example, is the issue of deficits and debt. That has fanned a lot of peopleÃ¢ÂÂs concerns because we had to take a lot of emergency decisions last year that cost money. Now, they were the right things to do. Had we not taken them, the economy would be in a much worse position. Even John McCainÃ¢ÂÂs former economist during the campaign has said that if we hadnÃ¢ÂÂt taken these steps, that we might have lost another 8 million jobs, and we would be in an even deeper hole.

MR. HARWOOD: And we know you have that commission that reports in December, but I think a lot of Americans may wonder how serious you are about what that commission is going to do.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me tell you. WeÃ¢ÂÂve already identified $250 billion in cuts on the discretionary side of our budget. WeÃ¢ÂÂve identified $300 billion worth of loopholes in our tax code that are not helping economic growth. If we just did those two things, as IÃ¢ÂÂve already proposed, that would make a huge difference. WeÃ¢ÂÂve proposed to freeze discretionary spending for three years, to start whittling down some of the debt that I inherited.

MR. HARWOOD: Peter Orszag, as you know, your former budget director, says that we canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to extend the Bush tax cuts for anyone after a year or two. Is he right?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I want to make sure I get this gentlemanÃ¢ÂÂs question in, but I will say this. The debate that weÃ¢ÂÂre having about tax cuts right now I think really speaks to the choices that everybody here is going to be facing as we go forward. I think all of us are concerned about the deficit; all of us are concerned about the debt. Now, what weÃ¢ÂÂve said is that we should extend tax cuts, tax relief, for middle-class Americans -- like most of the audience here -- because, first of all, youÃ¢ÂÂre the ones who didn't see your wages or income rise. Second of all, youÃ¢ÂÂre the folks who are most likely to spend it on a new computer for your kids, or in some other fashion that would boost demand in the economy.

Everybody agrees that this should be done. All weÃ¢ÂÂve said is that you get those tax breaks up to $250,000 a year. After that, if you make more than $250,000 a year, you still get a tax break; itÃ¢ÂÂs just you only get it up to $250,000 --

MR. HARWOOD: House Speak Pelosi said last week --

THE PRESIDENT: And let me say this, John, because I just think itÃ¢ÂÂs very important that everybody understands this. What the Republicans are proposing is that we, in addition to that, provide tax relief to primarily millionaires and billionaires. It would cost us $700 billion to do it. On average, millionaires would get a check of $100,000.

And by the way, I would be helped by this, so I just want to be clear. IÃ¢ÂÂm speaking against my own financial interests. This is a -- it is a irresponsible thing for us to do. Those folks are the least likely to spend it and -- (applause.)

MR. HARWOOD: Well, let me ask you from this angle. House Speaker Pelosi last week said you can get 80 percent of the revenue if you simply take away the tax cuts for people over a million dollars. Are you open to any sort of compromise that would capture most of that revenue, but those people between $250,000 and a million would get to keep that tax cut?

THE PRESIDENT: HereÃ¢ÂÂs the basic principle. HereÃ¢ÂÂs what I canÃ¢ÂÂt do as President. I think IÃ¢ÂÂve worked pretty hard and I have a pretty big grasp of the challenges that weÃ¢ÂÂre facing. (Applause.) But hereÃ¢ÂÂs what I canÃ¢ÂÂt do. I canÃ¢ÂÂt give tax cuts to the top 2 percent of Americans, 86 percent of that money going to people making a million dollars or more, and lower the deficit at the same time. I donÃ¢ÂÂt have the math.

I would love to do it. Every -- anybody in elected office would love nothing more than to give everybody tax cuts, not cut services, make sure that IÃ¢ÂÂm providing help to student loans, make sure that weÃ¢ÂÂre keeping our roads safe and our bridges safe, and make sure that weÃ¢ÂÂre paying for our veterans who are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. At some point, the numbers just donÃ¢ÂÂt work.

So what IÃ¢ÂÂve said is very simple. LetÃ¢ÂÂs go ahead and move forward on what we agree to, which is tax relief for 95 -- 97 percent of Americans. In fact, actually everybody would get tax relief, but just up to $250,000 a year more. And letÃ¢ÂÂs get the economy moving faster, letÃ¢ÂÂs get it growing faster. At some point in the future, if we want to have discussions about further lowering tax rates, letÃ¢ÂÂs do so at a time when we can actually afford it.

MR. HARWOOD: All right, weÃ¢ÂÂve kept this gentleman waiting long enough.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.

Q Mr. President, it is an honor to be in front of you. I am a small business owner. I'm a third-generation business owner in Pennsylvania. We are actually celebrating our 100th-year anniversary because we were founded in 1910.

THE PRESIDENT: Congratulations. (Applause.) WhatÃ¢ÂÂs your business?

Q Something called Susquehanna Glass, and we do monogrammed glasswork.



THE PRESIDENT: Outstanding.

Q If you ever pick up a Williams-Sonoma catalog and buy a monogrammed glass, youÃ¢ÂÂre getting the stuff from me. (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: Congratulations -- and your grandfather started this?

Q My grandfather and his brother started the business, yes, three generations.

THE PRESIDENT: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs outstanding. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs great.

Q Two world wars, one Great Depression, and a lot of economic recession, so weÃ¢ÂÂve been through a lot. What I have learned in running a small business over that period of time is that to succeed, to survive, you have to reinvest in your business. It simply is imperative. The single greatest economic challenge that I face today is a public that is fearful and negative.

You, when you first came into office, your stimulus package actually funded a very ailing financial system, which was essential for small businesspeople. You turned around and invested in the auto industry, and I believe saved millions of jobs, and I think youÃ¢ÂÂre actually going to make a profit on them. (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT: We are. That's true.

Q And yet your critics continue to paint you as a dramatically anti-business President. I believe you are investing in this country, as small businesses invest. And yet for some reason the public just doesnÃ¢ÂÂt get it. I need you to help us understand how you can regain the political center, because youÃ¢ÂÂre losing the war of sound bites, youÃ¢ÂÂre losing the media cycles.

I have a son that just graduated from college. He was just commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army. He wants to make a career of the Army. I want to have a business for him to come back to when he gets out of the Army.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, let me say to your son thank you for your service to our country, and we want to make sure weÃ¢ÂÂve got a strong economy for him to come back to. (Applause.)

As I said before, I think that if you look at what weÃ¢ÂÂve done over the last two years, itÃ¢ÂÂs very hard to find evidence of anything that weÃ¢ÂÂve done that is designed to squash business as opposed to promote business.

You mentioned the auto industry. This is a great example of something that we did -- we knew it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt popular. I mean, people just -- the last thing folks wanted to see was us helping the auto industry. Now, keep in mind, the previous administration had been helping them, giving them billions of dollars and just asking nothing in return. But we were at a point where two of the big three automakers were about to liquidate, in the midst of this huge recession, and we would have lost an additional million jobs as a consequence, but also lost what is a signature manufacturing industry in this country. I mean, we built the world auto industry.

And so what we did was we said to the auto companies, we are going to help you, but youÃ¢ÂÂve got to make some changes. YouÃ¢ÂÂve got to make sure that we see a restructuring of how you do business. And by the way, some of the folks who made the biggest concessions were actually the workers there. It wasnÃ¢ÂÂt -- they took huge cuts in terms of pay and benefits because they understood that there wage structures could no longer support the auto industry in a competitive era.

We are now seeing the top -- the three U.S. automakers making a profit for the first time in a long time. They are hiring for the first time in a long time. And that has huge ramifications, because there are suppliers, and the restaurant next to the plant that's open -- and so it has provided a lot of confidence in a lot of these communities. But it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt popular at the time.

Now, there were some folks in -- on CNBC who were unhappy with our decision, partly because they had made bets, essentially, against the auto industry, or they had senior debt. And we said, you know what, if the workers are giving up something, if management is giving up something, if the federal government is giving up something, and taxpayers are giving something, youÃ¢ÂÂre not going to get a hundred percent of what you bargained for in terms of some of the investments that you made here. YouÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to take a haircut, too. And they got very mad about it. I still remember some of the fulminating that was taking place on CNBC about it. (Laughter.)

We didnÃ¢ÂÂt do that because we were anti-business. We were doing it because we wanted to make sure that these businesses would continue. And by the way, some of the same folks who complained were some of the same folks who, if we hadnÃ¢ÂÂt taken some of those actions on Wall Street, would have lost everything they had. And they didnÃ¢ÂÂt mind us intervening when it was helping them. But they did mind it when we were helping some other folks.

So the point, I guess, IÃ¢ÂÂm making is this. I think that American businesses like yours are what make this country go. We have passed eight tax cuts for small businesses so far. We have made it easier for you to invest in plants and equipment. We have already taken down your capital gains and we want to reduce capital gains for small businesses down to zero. All of these things are what historically have been considered pro-business agendas.

Even on health care, a lot of small businesses couldnÃ¢ÂÂt provide health care. We are now saying weÃ¢ÂÂve giving you a tax break if you provide health care to your workers. And 4 mil"	0

AMANPOUR (voice-over): Welcome to our viewers here and around the world. I'm Christiane Amanpour. And at the top of the news this week, the Gang of 20. At the big summit in Seoul, U.S. economic policies come under fire from China and Germany. Are America's woes putting its global leadership in question?

OBAMA: A whole host of other countries are doing very well. Naturally, they are going to be more assertive.

AMANPOUR: Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham debate America's role in the world.

Then, American austerity.

BOWLES: The path we're on today is not sustainable. We are headed for disaster.

AMANPOUR: Two members of the president's deficit commission, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad and Honeywell International Chairman and CEO David Cote share some sobering views on tough economic choices the United States faces.

And the coming showdown over tax cuts.

BOEHNER: Making these permanent will be the most important thing we could do to help create jobs in the country.

AMANPOUR: That and all the week's politics on our roundtable with George Will, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post, and Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution.

And the Sunday funnies.

FALLON: China is expected to overtake the U.S. as the world's biggest economy in the next two years. Americans couldn't believe it. They were like, ""That hasn't happened already?""

(LAUGHTER)

ANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation's capital, ABC ""This Week"" with Christiane Amanpour starts now.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: And hello again.

By the time Air Force One lands in Washington this evening, it will have flown around the world, a world that is fast changing, as the president found out during his 10-day trip to Asia. ABC's senior White House correspondent Jake Tapper has been with the president and brings us this report.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

TAPPER (voice-over): Rebuked by American voters and reminded to focus more on the economy, President Obama began his Asian trip talking it up as a sort of international stimulus to open markets to American goods and bolster American jobs.

OBAMA: We're actually doing some business while we're here. With every $1 billion we sell in exports, 5,000 jobs are supported at home. For America, this is a job strategy.

TAPPER: In Mumbai, India, flanked by American CEOs, the president announced deals between U.S. and Indian companies totaling nearly $10 billion in U.S. exports and maintaining more than 50,000 American jobs.

A cause for celebration, as he and the first lady joined in on the festivities marking the Hindu holiday of Diwali.

(on-screen): By the end of the week here in South Korea, there was no cause for dancing. Some of the world's fastest-growing economies refused President Obama's entreaties to alter their economic policies, policies the president needs changed to fully implement his export strategy, his job strategy.

OBAMA: Instead of hitting home runs, sometimes we're going to hit singles.

TAPPER (voice-over): And sometimes he struck out, failing to convince South Korea to open their markets to American beef and cars. At stake: $10 billion in exports and 70,000 American jobs.

Failing to convince Chinese President Hu Jintao to stop artificially building up the dollar and holding down Chinese currency.

And failing to convince his fellow G-20 leaders to use stronger language in the joint declaration on China's currency manipulation.

OBAMA: That is an irritant not just to the United States, but is an irritant to a lot of China's trading partners and those who are competing with China to sell goods around the world.

TAPPER: The president was even forced to push back on attacks that the U.S. was engaging in its own currency manipulation, defending a move by the independent Federal Reserve to inject $600 billion into the U.S. economy.

OBAMA: From everything I can see, this decision was not one designed to have an impact on the currency, on the dollar. It was designed to grow the economy.

TAPPER: Criticisms from G-20 leaders who questioned President Obama's spending habits were made all the more relevant when the co-chairs of the president's own debt commission put forth controversial proposals to reduce the deficit.

BOWLES: This debt is like a cancer that will truly destroy this country from within.

TAPPER: Ones attacked by liberals and conservative, showing how difficult reducing the deficit will be. Modesty was forced upon the president in this trip full of complications.

146	"April 18, 2010 Ã¢ÂÂ -- Bill Clinton made mistakes as president on financial regulation, he admitted in an exclusive ""This Week"" interview, but Clinton stood his ground regarding the dangers of overheated political rhetoric, saying Rush Limbaugh's accusation Clinton ""set the stage for violence"" with a recent speech on the subject ""doesn't make any sense.""

In his first ""This Week"" interview since the passage of health care reform, Clinton reflected on how the bill's success made him feel like Teddy Roosevelt to Obama's FDR. And Clinton offered advice and thoughts on some of Obama's next issues -- a Supreme Court nomination, the Middle East peace process and the midterm elections.

Anchor Jake Tapper asked Clinton about Limbaugh's criticism of his speech marking the upcoming 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing. In that speech, Clinton warned that ""the words we use really do matter, because there's this vast echo chamber, and they go across space and they fall on the serious and delirious alike. They fall on the connected and the unhinged alike.""

On ""This Week,"" Clinton said, ""The only point I tried to make was that we ought to have a lot of political dissent -- a lot of political argument. Nobody is right all the time. But we also have to take responsibility for the possible consequences of what we say.""

Clinton said he worries about threats against President Obama and the Congress. And, he worries ""about more careless language ... some of which we've seen against the Republican governor in New Jersey, Gov. Christie.""

A recently leaked memo from a New Jersey teacher joked about Christie dying.

""I think we all have to be careful,"" Clinton said. ""We ought to remember [that] after Oklahoma City we learned something about the difference in disagreement and demonization.""

Clinton acknowledged that he was wrong to take what he now views as bad advice from his Treasury secretaries, Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, who told him the market for complex financial instruments known as derivatives ought to remain unregulated.

""On derivatives, yeah, I think they were wrong and I think I was wrong to take [their advice],"" Clinton said, ""because the argument on derivatives was that these things are expensive and sophisticated and only a handful of investors will buy them, and they don't need any extra protection and any extra transparency. The money they're putting up guarantees them transparency.

""The flaw in that argument,"" Clinton added, ""was that first of all sometimes people with a lot of money make stupid decisions and make it without transparency.""

The former president said he also was wrong in his understanding of what a collapse in the derivative market could do to the economy.

""The most important flaw,"" he said, ""was even if less than 1 percent of the total investment community is involved in derivative exchanges, so much money was involved that if they went bad, they could affect 100 percent of the investments, and indeed 100 percent of the citizens in countries, not investors. And I was wrong about that.""

He now wishes he had tried to regulate derivatives while in office, but he doesn't think he would have been successful.

""Now, I think if I had tried to regulate them, because the Republicans were the majority in the Congress, they would have stopped it,"" he said. ""But I wish I should have been caught trying. I mean, that was a mistake I made."""	0
147	"A transcript of an Oval Office interview Friday with President Donald Trump by AP White House Correspondent Julie Pace. Where the audio recording of the interview is unclear, ellipses or a notation that the recording was unintelligible are used.

AP: I do want to talk to you about the 100 days.

TRUMP: Good.

AP: I want to ask a few questions on some topics that are happening toward the end of the interview.

TRUMP: Did you see Aya (Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who had been detained in the country for nearly three years) ...

AP: Can you tell me a little bit about how that came about?

TRUMP: No, just Ã¢ÂÂ you know, I asked the government to let her out. ...

TRUMP: You know Obama worked on it for three years, got zippo, zero.

AP: How did you hear about this story?

TRUMP: Many people, human rights people, are talking about it. ItÃ¢ÂÂs an incredible thing, especially when you meet her. You realize Ã¢ÂÂ I mean, she was in a rough place.

AP: Did you have to strike a deal with (Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah) el-Sissi over this?

TRUMP: No. No deal. He was here. He Ã¢ÂÂ I said, Ã¢ÂÂI really would appreciate it if you would look into this and let her out.Ã¢ÂÂ And as you know, she went through a trial. And anyway, she was let go. And not only she, it was a total of eight people. ...

___

TRUMP: Yeah, itÃ¢ÂÂs funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel.

(Crosstalk) AP: Really?

TRUMP: Chancellor Merkel.

TRUMP: And I guess somebody shouted out, Ã¢ÂÂShake her hand, shake her hand,Ã¢ÂÂ you know. But I never heard it. But I had already shaken her hand four times. You know, because we were together for a long time.

AP: Did you expect you would have good chemistry with her?

TRUMP: No. Because, um, IÃ¢ÂÂm at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and IÃ¢ÂÂm at odds on immigration. We had unbelievable chemistry. And people have given me credit for having great chemistry with all of the leaders, including el-Sissi. ...

TRUMP: So it was a great thing to see that happen.

___

AP: Do you feel like you have changed the office of the presidency, how the presidency can be used to effect change?

TRUMP: I think the 100 days is, you know, itÃ¢ÂÂs an artificial barrier. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not very meaningful. I think IÃ¢ÂÂve established amazing relationships that will be used the four or eight years, whatever period of time IÃ¢ÂÂm here. I think for that I would be getting very high marks because IÃ¢ÂÂve established great relationships with countries, as President el-Sissi has shown and others have shown. Well, if you look at the president of China, people said theyÃ¢ÂÂve never seen anything like whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on right now. I really liked him a lot. I think he liked me. We have a great chemistry together. ...

TRUMP: IÃ¢ÂÂve developed great relationships with all of these leaders. NobodyÃ¢ÂÂs written that. In fact, they said, Ã¢ÂÂOh, well, heÃ¢ÂÂs not treating them nicely,Ã¢ÂÂ because on NATO, I want them to pay up. But I still get along with them great, and they will pay up. In fact, with the Italian prime minister yesterday, you saw, we were joking, Ã¢ÂÂCome on, you have to pay up, you have to pay up.Ã¢ÂÂ HeÃ¢ÂÂll pay.

AP: Did he say that? In your meeting? Your private meeting?

TRUMP: HeÃ¢ÂÂs going to end up paying. But you know, nobody ever asked the question. Nobody asked. Nobody ever asked him to pay up. So itÃ¢ÂÂs a different kind of a presidency.

AP: Do you feel like thatÃ¢ÂÂs one thing that youÃ¢ÂÂve changed, that you maybe are actually asking the direct questions about some of these things?

TRUMP: Yeah. Let me give me an example. A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. It was seven years behind schedule. It was a disaster. So I called in Lockheed and I said, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm sorry, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing,Ã¢ÂÂ or whoever else. But Boeing. And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth. ...

TRUMP: I saved $725 million on the 90 planes. Just 90. Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered. On 90 planes I saved $725 million. ItÃ¢ÂÂs actually a little bit more than that, but itÃ¢ÂÂs $725 million. Gen. Mattis, who had to sign the deal when it came to his office, said, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve never seen anything like this in my life.Ã¢ÂÂ We went from a company that wanted more money for the planes to a company that cut. And the reason they cut Ã¢ÂÂ same planes, same everything Ã¢ÂÂ was because of me. I mean, because thatÃ¢ÂÂs what I do.

TRUMP: Now if you multiply that times 3,000 planes, you know this is on 90 planes. In fact, when the Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe of Japan came in because they bought a certain number of those ... The first thing he said to me, because it was right at the time I did it, he said, Ã¢ÂÂCould I thank you?Ã¢ÂÂ I said, Ã¢ÂÂWhat?Ã¢ÂÂ He said, Ã¢ÂÂYou saved us $100 million.Ã¢ÂÂ Because they got a $100 million savings on the 10 or 12 planes that they (bought). Nobody wrote that story. Now you know thatÃ¢ÂÂs a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order. But this was only 90 of those 2,500 planes.

AP: And you expect those savings to carry out across that full order?

TRUMP: More. IÃ¢ÂÂm gonna get more than that. This was a thing that was out of control and now itÃ¢ÂÂs great. And the woman that runs Lockheed, Marillyn (Hewson), she was great. But all of a sudden it was a different kind of a thing. You know?

___

AP: Do you feel like youÃ¢ÂÂve been able to apply that kind of a relationship to your dealings with Congress as well?

TRUMP: I have great relationships with Congress. I think weÃ¢ÂÂre doing very well and I think we have a great foundation for future things. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to be applying, I shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt tell you this, but weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be announcing, probably on Wednesday, tax reform. And itÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂve worked on it long and hard. And youÃ¢ÂÂve got to understand, IÃ¢ÂÂve only been here now 93 days, 92 days. President Obama took 17 months to do Obamacare. IÃ¢ÂÂve been here 92 days but IÃ¢ÂÂve only been working on the health care, you know I had to get like a little bit of grounding right? Health care started after 30 day(s), so IÃ¢ÂÂve been working on health care for 60 days. ...You know, weÃ¢ÂÂre very close. And itÃ¢ÂÂs a great plan, you know, we have to get it approved.

AP: Is it this deal thatÃ¢ÂÂs between the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus, is that the deal youÃ¢ÂÂre looking at?

TRUMP: So the Republican Party has various groups, all great people. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre great people. But some are moderate, some are very conservative. The Democrats donÃ¢ÂÂt seem to have that nearly as much. You know the Democrats have, they donÃ¢ÂÂt have that. The Republicans do have that. And I think itÃ¢ÂÂs fine. But you know thereÃ¢ÂÂs a pretty vast area in there. And I have a great relationship with all of them. Now, we have government not closing. I think weÃ¢ÂÂll be in great shape on that. ItÃ¢ÂÂs going very well. Obviously, that takes precedent.

AP: That takes precedent over health care? For next week?

TRUMP: Yeah, sure. Next week. Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier. The press keeps talking about the hundred days. But weÃ¢ÂÂve done a lot. You have a list of things. I donÃ¢ÂÂt have to read it.

___

AP: You did put out though, as a candidate, you put out a 100-day plan. Do you feel like you should be held accountable to that plan?

TRUMP: Somebody, yeah, somebody put out the concept of a hundred-day plan. But yeah. Well, IÃ¢ÂÂm mostly there on most items. Go over the items, and IÃ¢ÂÂll talk to you ...

(Crosstalk.)

TRUMP: But things change. There has to be flexibility. Let me give you an example. President Xi, we have a, like, a really great relationship. For me to call him a currency manipulator and then say, Ã¢ÂÂBy the way, IÃ¢ÂÂd like you to solve the North Korean problem,Ã¢ÂÂ doesnÃ¢ÂÂt work. So you have to have a certain flexibility, Number One. Number Two, from the time I took office till now, you know, itÃ¢ÂÂs a very exact thing. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not like generalities. Do you want a Coke or anything?

AP: IÃ¢ÂÂm OK, thank you. No. ...

TRUMP: But President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators. Because thereÃ¢ÂÂs a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever. But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if heÃ¢ÂÂs helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, Ã¢ÂÂBy the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, youÃ¢ÂÂre a currency manipulator.Ã¢ÂÂ It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt work that way.

AP: Right.

TRUMP: And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness. But you know some of them either donÃ¢ÂÂt get it, in which case theyÃ¢ÂÂre very stupid people, or they just donÃ¢ÂÂt want to say it. You know because of a couple of them said, Ã¢ÂÂHe didnÃ¢ÂÂt call them a currency manipulator.Ã¢ÂÂ Well, for two reasons. Number One, heÃ¢ÂÂs not, since my time. You know, very specific formula. You would think itÃ¢ÂÂs like generalities, itÃ¢ÂÂs not. They have Ã¢ÂÂ theyÃ¢ÂÂve actually Ã¢ÂÂ their currencyÃ¢ÂÂs gone up. So itÃ¢ÂÂs a very, very specific formula. And I said, Ã¢ÂÂHow badly have they been,Ã¢ÂÂ ... they said, Ã¢ÂÂSince you got to office they have not manipulated their currency.Ã¢ÂÂ ThatÃ¢ÂÂs Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea. Now maybe thatÃ¢ÂÂll work out or maybe it wonÃ¢ÂÂt. Can you imagine? ...

AP: So in terms of the 100-day plan that you did put out during the campaign, do you feel, though, that people should hold you accountable to this in terms of judging success?

TRUMP: No, because much of the foundationÃ¢ÂÂs been laid. Things came up. IÃ¢ÂÂll give you an example. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt put Supreme Court judge on the 100 (day) plan, and I got a Supreme Court judge.

AP: I think itÃ¢ÂÂs on there.

TRUMP: I donÃ¢ÂÂt know. ...

AP: Ã¢ÂÂBegin the process of selecting.Ã¢ÂÂ You actually exceeded on this one. This says, Ã¢ÂÂBegin the process of selecting a replacement.Ã¢ÂÂ

TRUMP: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the biggest thing IÃ¢ÂÂve done.

AP: Do you consider that your biggest success?

TRUMP: Well, I Ã¢ÂÂ first of all I think heÃ¢ÂÂs a great man. I think he will be a great, great justice of the Supreme Court. I have always heard that the selection and the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge is the biggest thing a president can do. DonÃ¢ÂÂt forget, he could be there for 40 years. ... HeÃ¢ÂÂs a young man. IÃ¢ÂÂve always heard that thatÃ¢ÂÂs the biggest thing. Now, I would say that defense is the biggest thing. You know, to be honest, there are a number of things. But IÃ¢ÂÂve always heard that the highest calling is the nomination of a Supreme Court justice. IÃ¢ÂÂve done one in my first 70 days.

TRUMP: Our military is so proud. They were not proud at all. They had their heads down. Now they have their heads up. ...

TRUMP: IÃ¢ÂÂm rebuilding the military. We have great people. We have great things in place. We have tremendous borders. I mention the F-35 because if I can save $725 million Ã¢ÂÂ look at that, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a massive amount of money. And IÃ¢ÂÂll save more as we make more planes. If I can save that on a small number of planes Ã¢ÂÂ Gen. (Jim) Mattis (the defense secretary) said, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve never seen anything like this,Ã¢ÂÂ because he had to sign the ultimate (unintelligible) ... He had to sign the ultimate, you know. He said, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve never seen anything like this before, as long as IÃ¢ÂÂve been in the military.Ã¢ÂÂ You know, that kind of cutting.

AP: Right.

TRUMP: Now, if I can do that (unintelligible) ... As an example, the aircraft carriers, billions of dollars, the Gerald Ford, billions and billions over budget. That wonÃ¢ÂÂt happen.

AP: Is that something youÃ¢ÂÂre going to take on?

TRUMP: (unintelligible) But as we order the other ones, because they want to order 12, the other ones are going to come in much less expensive. ...

___

AP: Can I ask you, over your first 100 days Ã¢ÂÂ youÃ¢ÂÂre not quite there yet Ã¢ÂÂ how do you feel like the office has changed you?

TRUMP: Well the one thing I would say Ã¢ÂÂ and I say this to people Ã¢ÂÂ I never realized how big it was. EverythingÃ¢ÂÂs so (unintelligible) like, you know the orders are so massive. I was talking to Ã¢ÂÂ

AP: You mean the responsibility of it, or do you mean Ã¢ÂÂ

TRUMP: Number One, thereÃ¢ÂÂs great responsibility. When it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria. IÃ¢ÂÂm saying to myself, Ã¢ÂÂYou know, this is more than just like, 79 (sic) missiles. This is death thatÃ¢ÂÂs involved,Ã¢ÂÂ because people could have been killed. This is risk thatÃ¢ÂÂs involved, because if the missile goes off and goes in a city or goes in a civilian area Ã¢ÂÂ you know, the boats were hundreds of miles away Ã¢ÂÂ and if this missile goes off and lands in the middle of a town or a hamlet .... every decision is much harder than youÃ¢ÂÂd normally make. (unintelligible) ... This is involving death and life and so many things. ... So itÃ¢ÂÂs far more responsibility. (unintelligible) ....The financial cost of everything is so massive, every agency. This is thousands of times bigger, the United States, than the biggest company in the world. The second-largest company in the world is the Defense Department. The third-largest company in the world is Social Security. The fourth-largest Ã¢ÂÂ you know, you go down the list.

AP: Right.

TRUMP. ItÃ¢ÂÂs massive. And every agency is, like, bigger than any company. So you know, I really just see the bigness of it all, but also the responsibility. And the human responsibility. You know, the human life thatÃ¢ÂÂs involved in some of the decisions.

___

AP: YouÃ¢ÂÂve talked a little bit about the way that youÃ¢ÂÂve brought some business skills into the office. Is there anything from your business background that just doesnÃ¢ÂÂt translate into the presidency, that just simply is not applicable to this job?

TRUMP: Well in business, you donÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily need heart, whereas here, almost everything affects people. So if youÃ¢ÂÂre talking about health care Ã¢ÂÂ you have health care in business but youÃ¢ÂÂre trying to just negotiate a good price on health care, et cetera, et cetera. YouÃ¢ÂÂre providing health. This is (unintelligible). Here, everything, pretty much everything you do in government, involves heart, whereas in business, most things donÃ¢ÂÂt involve heart.

AP: WhatÃ¢ÂÂs that switch been like for you?

TRUMP: In fact, in business youÃ¢ÂÂre actually better off without it.

AP: WhatÃ¢ÂÂs making that switch been like for you?

TRUMP: You have to love people. And if you love people, such a big responsibility. (unintelligible) You can take any single thing, including even taxes. I mean weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be doing major tax reform. HereÃ¢ÂÂs part of your story, itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a big (unintelligible). EverybodyÃ¢ÂÂs saying, Ã¢ÂÂOh, heÃ¢ÂÂs delaying.Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂm not delaying anything. IÃ¢ÂÂll tell you the other thing is (unintelligible). I used to get great press. I get the worst press. I get such dishonest reporting with the media. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs another thing that really has Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂve never had anything like it before. It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said, Ã¢ÂÂWell the one thing good is now IÃ¢ÂÂll get good press.Ã¢ÂÂ And it got worse. (unintelligible) So that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me. I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty.

___

AP: But in terms of tax reform, how are you going to roll that out next week?

TRUMP: Well IÃ¢ÂÂm going to roll (out) probably on Wednesday, around Wednesday of next week, weÃ¢ÂÂre putting out a massive tax reform Ã¢ÂÂ business and for people Ã¢ÂÂ we want to do both. WeÃ¢ÂÂve been working on it (unintelligible). Secretary Mnuchin is a very talented person, very smart. Very successful (unintelligible). ... WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to be putting that out on Wednesday or shortly thereafter. Let me leave a little room just in case (unintelligible). ... And thatÃ¢ÂÂs a big story, because a lot of people think IÃ¢ÂÂm going to put it out much later.

AP: Do you have any details on that in terms of rates?

TRUMP: Only in terms that it will be a massive tax cut. It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut weÃ¢ÂÂve ever had. ...

___

AP: Obviously, thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to come in a week where youÃ¢ÂÂre going to be running up against the deadline for keeping the government open. If you get a bill on your desk that does not include funding for the wall, will you sign it?

TRUMP: I donÃ¢ÂÂt know yet. People want the border wall. My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it Ã¢ÂÂ youÃ¢ÂÂve been to many of the rallies. OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall. My base, which is a big base; I think my base is 45 percent. You know, itÃ¢ÂÂs funny. The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college. Big, big, big advantage. IÃ¢ÂÂve always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college Ã¢ÂÂ but itÃ¢ÂÂs a whole different campaign (unintelligible). The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it. They want to see the wall, they want to see security. Now, it just came out that theyÃ¢ÂÂre 73 percent down. ... ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a tremendous achievement. ... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and itÃ¢ÂÂs going lower. Now, people arenÃ¢ÂÂt coming because they know theyÃ¢ÂÂre not going to get through, and there isnÃ¢ÂÂt crime. You know the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that? (Unintelligible.) Now, much of thatÃ¢ÂÂs stopped because they canÃ¢ÂÂt get through.

AP: It sounds like maybe youÃ¢ÂÂre beginning to send a message that if you do get a spending bill that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have border funding in there, you would sign it.

TRUMP: Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers IÃ¢ÂÂm seeing. IÃ¢ÂÂm seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive.

AP: What do you think the estimate on it would be?

TRUMP: Oh IÃ¢ÂÂm seeing numbers Ã¢ÂÂ $24 billion, I think IÃ¢ÂÂll do it for $10 billion or less. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not a lot of money relative to what weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about. If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in Ã¢ÂÂ and weÃ¢ÂÂll stop all of it. But if we stop 1 percent of the drugs because we have the wall Ã¢ÂÂ theyÃ¢ÂÂre coming around in certain areas, but if you have a wall, they canÃ¢ÂÂt do it because itÃ¢ÂÂs a real wall. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a tremendously good investment, 1 percent. The drugs pouring through on the southern border are unbelievable. WeÃ¢ÂÂre becoming a drug culture, thereÃ¢ÂÂs so much. And most of itÃ¢ÂÂs coming from the southern border. The wall will stop the drugs.

AP: But, just trying to nail you down on it one more time, will you sign a spending bill if it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have Ã¢ÂÂ

TRUMP: I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to comment. I just donÃ¢ÂÂt know yet. I mean, I have to see whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on. I really do. But the wallÃ¢ÂÂs a very important thing to Ã¢ÂÂ not only my base, but to the people. And even if it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt, I mean IÃ¢ÂÂll do things that arenÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily popular. ... The wall is very important to stopping drugs.

AP: If you donÃ¢ÂÂt have a funding stream, your message to your base is what?

TRUMP: My base understands the wall is going to get built, whether I have it funded here or if I get it funded shortly thereafter, that wallÃ¢ÂÂs getting built, OK? One hundred percent. One hundred percent itÃ¢ÂÂs getting built. And itÃ¢ÂÂs also getting built for much less money Ã¢ÂÂ I hope you get this Ã¢ÂÂ than these people are estimating. The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not going to cost anywhere near that.

AP: You think $10 billion or less.

TRUMP: I think $10 billion or less. And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more. But itÃ¢ÂÂs not going to be anywhere near (those) kind of numbers. And theyÃ¢ÂÂre using those numbers; theyÃ¢ÂÂre using the high numbers to make it sound impalatable (sic). And the fact itÃ¢ÂÂs going to cost much less money, just like the airplane I told you about, which I hope you can write about.

(Off-the-record discussion.)

___

TRUMP: They had a quote from me that NATOÃ¢ÂÂs obsolete. But they didnÃ¢ÂÂt say why it was obsolete. I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt in government. People donÃ¢ÂÂt go around asking about NATO if IÃ¢ÂÂm building a building in Manhattan, right? So they asked me, Wolf ... asked me about NATO, and I said two things. NATOÃ¢ÂÂs obsolete Ã¢ÂÂ not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO Ã¢ÂÂ NATO is obsolete, and I said, Ã¢ÂÂAnd the reason itÃ¢ÂÂs obsolete is because of the fact they donÃ¢ÂÂt focus on terrorism.Ã¢ÂÂ You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.

AP: What specifically has NATO changed?

TRUMP: (Cites Wall Street Journal article) ... I did an interview with Wolf Blitzer, and I said NATO was obsolete Ã¢ÂÂ I said two things Ã¢ÂÂ obsolete, and the countryÃ¢ÂÂs arenÃ¢ÂÂt paying. I was right about both. I took such heat for about three days on both, because nobody ever criticized NATO. I took heat like you wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt believe. And then some expert on NATO said, Ã¢ÂÂYou know, Trump is right.Ã¢ÂÂ But I said it was obsolete because they werenÃ¢ÂÂt focused on terror. ...

ItÃ¢ÂÂs not fair that weÃ¢ÂÂre paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when theyÃ¢ÂÂre supposed to be paying 2 percent. And IÃ¢ÂÂm very strong on it and IÃ¢ÂÂm going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month.Ã¢ÂÂ

__

AP: This morning you tweeted that after the possible terrorist attack in Paris, that it will have a big effect on the upcoming French election. What did you mean by that?

TRUMP: Well, I think it will have a big effect on who people are going to vote for in the election.

AP: Do you think itÃ¢ÂÂs going to help Marine Le Pen?

TRUMP: I think so.

AP: Do you believe that she should be the president?

TRUMP: No, I have no comment on that, but I think that itÃ¢ÂÂll probably help her because she is the strongest on borders and she is the strongest on whatÃ¢ÂÂs been going on in France.

AP: Do you worry at all that by saying that, that a terrorist attack would have an impact on a democratic election, that it would actually embolden terrorists to try to Ã¢ÂÂ.

TRUMP: No. Look, everybody is making predictions who is going to win. I am no different than you, you could say the same thing. ...

AP: I just wonder if you are encouraging, you are the president of the United States, so to say that you worry that it encourages terrorists ...

TRUMP: No, I am no different than Ã¢ÂÂ no, I think it discourages terrorists, I think it discourages. I think what weÃ¢ÂÂve done on the border discourages it. I think that my stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism. IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to have it in this country. IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to let what happened to France and other places happen here. And itÃ¢ÂÂs already largely, you know Ã¢ÂÂ we have tens Ã¢ÂÂ we have hundreds of thousands of people that have been allowed into our country that should not be here. They shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be here. We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever. They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a big mistake.

AP: Just so that I am clear. You are not endorsing her for the office, but you are Ã¢ÂÂ

TRUMP: I am not endorsing her and I didnÃ¢ÂÂt mention her name.

AP: Right, I just wanted to make sure I have that clear.

TRUMP: I believe whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism and whoever is the toughest at the borders will do well at the election. I am not saying that person is going to win, she is not even favored to win, you know. Right now, she is in second place.

___

AP: I have a question on the markets, actually. One thing that I think has been different about this White House is that you do point to the markets as a sign of progress. Do you worry, though Ã¢ÂÂ I mean, the markets go up and down.

TRUMP: You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent. But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since. Five hundred thousand. ... As an example, Ford, General Motors. IÃ¢ÂÂve had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma (chairman of Alibaba Group), he comes up, he says, Ã¢ÂÂOnly because of you am I making this massive investment.Ã¢ÂÂ Intel, only because of you. ... The press never writes that.

___

AP: What about NAFTA? WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the plan on NAFTA?

TRUMP: What would you like to know?

AP: I would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating.

TRUMP: I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people donÃ¢ÂÂt even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.

AP: Is your plan still, though, to renegotiate the whole deal?

TRUMP: I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.

AP: Termination is still on the table.

TRUMP: Absolutely. If they donÃ¢ÂÂt treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA.

AP: WhatÃ¢ÂÂs a timeline for that decision?

TRUMP: ItÃ¢ÂÂs a six-month termination clause, I have the right to do it, itÃ¢ÂÂs a six-month clause.

___

AP: If I could fit a couple of more topics. Jeff Sessions, your attorney general, is taking a tougher line suddenly on Julian Assange, saying that arresting him is a priority. You were supportive of what WikiLeaks was doing during the campaign with the release of the Clinton emails. Do you think that arresting Assange is a priority for the United States?

TRUMP: When Wikileaks came out ... never heard of Wikileaks, never heard of it. When Wikileaks came out, all I was just saying is, Ã¢ÂÂWell, look at all this information here, this is pretty good stuff.Ã¢ÂÂ You know, they tried to hack the Republican, the RNC, but we had good defenses. They didnÃ¢ÂÂt have defenses, which is pretty bad management. But we had good defenses, they tried to hack both of them. They werenÃ¢ÂÂt able to get through to Republicans. No, I found it very interesting when I read this stuff and I said, Ã¢ÂÂWow.Ã¢ÂÂ It was just a figure of speech. I said, Ã¢ÂÂWell, look at this. ItÃ¢ÂÂs good reading.Ã¢ÂÂ

AP: But that didnÃ¢ÂÂt mean that you supported what Assange is doing?

TRUMP: No, I donÃ¢ÂÂt support or unsupport. It was just information. They shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have allowed it to get out. If they had the proper defensive devices on their internet, you know, equipment, they wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt even allow the FBI. How about this Ã¢ÂÂ they get hacked, and the FBI goes to see them, and they wonÃ¢ÂÂt let the FBI see their server. But do you understand, nobody ever writes it. Why wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt (former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John) Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server? They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based.

AP: CrowdStrike?

TRUMP: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what I heard. I heard itÃ¢ÂÂs owned by a very rich Ukrainian, thatÃ¢ÂÂs what I heard. But they brought in another company to investigate the server. Why didnÃ¢ÂÂt they allow the FBI in to investigate the server? I mean, there is so many things that nobody writes about. ItÃ¢ÂÂs incredible.

AP: Can I just ask you, though Ã¢ÂÂ do you believe it is a priority for the United States, or it should be a priority, to arrest Julian Assange?

TRUMP: I am not involved in that decision, but if Jeff Sessions wants to do it, itÃ¢ÂÂs OK with me. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt know about that decision, but if they want to do it, itÃ¢ÂÂs OK with me.

___

AP: On Iran, which is another thing you talked a lot on the campaign Ã¢ÂÂ

TRUMP: And the other thing that we should go after is the leakers. ...

AP: On Iran, you also talked about it quite a bit on the campaign trail. And you said in the press conference yesterday that you think that Iran is violating the spirit of the agreement. When you say that, do you mean in terms of the actual nuclear accord, or do you mean what they are doing in the region?

TRUMP: In terms of what they are doing all over the Middle East and beyond.

AP: So you believe that they are complying with the agreement?

TRUMP: No, I donÃ¢ÂÂt say that. I say that I believe they have broken the spirit of the agreement. There is a spirit to agreements, and they have broken it.

AP: In terms of what they are doing elsewhere in the Middle East?

TRUMP: In terms of what they are doing of all over.

AP: When you talk to European leaders, when you talk to Merkel, for example, or Teresa May, what do they say about the nuclear deal? Do they want you to stay in that deal?

TRUMP: I donÃ¢ÂÂt talk to them about it.

AP: You donÃ¢ÂÂt talk to them about the Iran deal?

TRUMP: I mention it, but itÃ¢ÂÂs very personal when I talk to them, you know, itÃ¢ÂÂs confidential. No, they have their own opinions. I donÃ¢ÂÂt say that they are different than my opinions, but IÃ¢ÂÂd rather have you ask them that question.

AP: At this point, do you believe that you will stay in the nuclear deal?

TRUMP: ItÃ¢ÂÂs possible that we wonÃ¢ÂÂt.

AP: Dreamers, youÃ¢ÂÂve talked about them, youÃ¢ÂÂve talked about heart earlier. This is one area where you have talked Ã¢ÂÂ

TRUMP: No, we arenÃ¢ÂÂt looking to do anything right now. Look, the dreamers ... this is an interesting case, they left and they came back and heÃ¢ÂÂs got some problems, itÃ¢ÂÂs a little different than the dreamer case, right? But we are putting MS-13 in jail and getting them the hell out of our country. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve taken over towns and cities and we are being really brutal with MS-13, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what we should be. They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as al-Qaida, which is a hell of a reference. So we are moving criminals out of our country and we are getting them out in record numbers and those are the people we are after. We are not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals.

AP: And thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be the policy of your administration to allow the dreamers to stay?

TRUMP: Yes. Yes. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs our policy. I am not saying ... long-term, we are going to have to fix the problem, the whole immigration problem. But I will tell you: Right now we have a great gentleman, one of my real stars is Gen. (John) Kelly, now (Homeland Security) Secretary Kelly. We are down 73 percent at the border, we are cleaning out cities and towns of hard-line criminals, some of the worst people on earth, people that rape and kill women, people that are killing people just for the sake of having fun. They are being thrown in jails and they are being ... all over the country and nobodyÃ¢ÂÂs ever done it like us, so we are being unbelievably thorough with that. We are out in Long Island cleaning out the MS-13 scum, they are all scum, thatÃ¢ÂÂs probably the worst gang anywhere on Earth. ...

AP: A lot of the dreamers have been hoping to hear something from you. I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to give them the wrong message with this.

Crossfire

Should U.S. Trust Russia on Syria?

Aired September 10, 2013 - 18:28 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



ANNOUNCER: Tonight on CROSSFIRE, as President Obama prepares to address the nation, he hits the pause button on attacking Syria. Should he follow Russia's lead or keep threatening a military strike?



JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: Nothing focuses the mind like the prospect of a hanging.



ANNOUNCER: On the left, Van Jones. On the right, S.E. Cupp. In the CROSSFIRE, Joe Lieberman, who supports the strike on Syria, and Rick Santorum, who's opposed. Is Russia's diplomacy real? Or should the U.S. strike Assad now? Tonight on CROSSFIRE.



VAN JONES, CO-HOST: Welcome to CROSSFIRE. I'm Van Jones on the left.



S.E. CUPP, CO-HOST: I'm S.E. Cupp on the right.



Tonight, the world is giddy at the prospect of getting out of a U.S. military strike on Syria. It's all thanks to Russia's offer of a diplomatic solution, even though it's a phony one. Nevertheless, the president's team is more than happy to take credit for it.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



KERRY: Well, it's the credible threat of force that has been on the table for these last weeks that has, for the first time, brought this regime to even acknowledge that they have a chemical weapons arsenal.



REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: This is a victory for President Obama, if it is real.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CUPP: Van, it seems like Nancy Pelosi is ready to order the ""mission accomplished"" banner. Look, everyone wants to parachute out of this conflict. I get that. But the Russians have offered us not a parachute but a knapsack. A knapsack that will never open. This is nothing more than a delay tactic.



JONES: Well, I disagree. First of all, I think the world is rightfully happy that we are off the path to war, possibly. The diplomatic option is a good thing. And frankly, everybody is giving John Kerry a hard time. I would rather for us to blunder on the path to peace than to stumble onto the path of war.



CUPP: If this were proposal -- if this proposal were real and offered up by legitimate, good actors, I would be happy to consider it.



JONES: Well, welcome to the real world, where you don't get the chance to pick who offers you a solution to this thing.



Look, we've got two former presidential candidates and two former senators -- both the same person -- tonight on CROSSFIRE to help us with this thing.



RICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR: Two friends, I might add. And two friends.



JONES: And two friends. Republican Rick Santorum is against attacking Syria. Democratic former senator, now independent, Joe Lieberman, he supports the strike.



The first question to you. You've got to be happy now. We've got a big diplomatic opening. You've got to be on President Obama's team now. You're happy, right?



CUPP: Leading question.



SANTORUM: If there's not going to be a military attack, that's a good thing. So if the president is willing to step down for whatever reason, look, he -- he went to the Congress because he didn't want to do this. If he wanted to do it, he'd said he had the power to do it. And he just decided not to.



When you consider the fact that, whether it's on immigration or health care or on DOMA or on a whole variety of things --



JONES: But are you --



SANTORUM: -- he's done things that he doesn't have the power to do. Now he has the power to do something, and he went to Congress. So it's clear he didn't want to do this.



JONES: You're on team Obama now.



SANTORUM: I'm on team ""let's not broaden this war and put a much more complicated diplomatic situation and military situation in the hands of someone who's proved incapable of handling the situation.""



JONES: We'll argue about that later.



CUPP: Senator Lieberman, why after two years and 100,000 people dead, two chemical attacks, two million refugees, why is pausing yet again to dither on this conflict the smart or moral decision?



JOE LIEBERMAN (I), FORMER CONNECTICUT SENATOR: Well, I wish we were not pausing. I mean, I think President Obama made the right moral decision when he drew the red line --



CUPP: Right.



LIEBERMAN: -- and then when he said, after we had proof that chemical weapons were used to kill almost 1,500 innocents, including 426 children by Assad in Syria, that he was going to take military action.



I was really surprised and disappointed when he decided to toss it to Congress. He was right. He had the legal authority to do it himself. I wish he had done it. If he had, I think the American people would have been happy now that he had done it.



CUPP: Should he attack now? Should he attack now without Congress?



LIEBERMAN: I -- well, I think, now that Russia has made this offer, even though it's hard to take it seriously coming from Russia which hasn't been our friend -- just look at the Snowden matter.



CUPP: Right.



LIEBERMAN: Look at Syria, where Assad -- John Kerry said correctly last week that he tried very hard to reach an agreement with Assad years ago as a senator and decided he was a liar.



JONES: But you're not saying we should through this peace offering in the garbage can and then -- and then attack now. Is that what you're saying?



LIEBERMAN: No, I'm saying that it's hard to take the proposal by Russia seriously, but it's important enough that we've got to challenge them to be serious about it and see if Syria really will, with international supervision and penalties, get rid of all their chemical weapons. If they did that, it would be a tremendous accomplishment.



But I think the president still has to face the fact, if nothing happens, that there was a chemical attack --



SANTORUM: The bottom line is here we have no national security interests.



JONES: We don't have any national security interests when children are being chemically --



SANTORUM: Then we should be in Darfur. Then we should be in 50 other countries around the world.



JONES: Hold on.



SANTORUM: That is not --



CUPP: What about --



SANTORUM: That is not a reason.



CUPP: What about al Qaeda?



SANTORUM: I wish -- I wish -- that is the point. The point is we have no set national security interest, because the two sides of this conflict are both enemies of the United States. We have al Qaeda, who is basically the dominant rebel force right now, on one side and we have on the other side Hezbollah, Iran, Russia and Assad. JONES: I don't understand what you want to do, though. Here's my problem. You are a leader on Syria. You are a big supporter and, frankly, the author of the Syrian Accountability Act.



SANTORUM: I was.



JONES: And now you seem to have completely disappeared. What is it that you think that should happen? I want to show you -- show you these images that have shocked the world. Can we show these images?



Look at these children. They're twitching. They're dying. What if one of the mothers of one of those children called this station right now and said to you, ""Why won't you help me? Why won't you help my children?"" You're saying there's no interest in doing that.



SANTORUM: The reason the United States -- and I think Joe will agree with me on this. We may disagree on where we come out, but the reason the United States uses military forces for one reason and one reason only. It's in our national security interests.



JONES: We have no moral obligation?



SANTORUM: We have no moral obligation to use military force when it comes to a humanitarian situation. We have other obligations.



JONES: Look, what -- but what can we do?



SANTORUM: We need to get involved. We need to -- the Syrian Accountability Act was about political sanctions. It was about economic sanctions. It was no trip wire for military force. And when the president used the Syrian Accountability Act as reasons for Congress to support him, he misled the American public on that.



CUPP: Senator Santorum --



SANTORUM: As the author, I know that.



CUPP: Senator Santorum, I know you. We go back a little ways. We've had some conservations about faith and morality and values, social conservatism. I don't understand -- help me understand -- how you square your conscience with not going in and ending a conflict where hundreds of thousands have died? How -- how are you not concerned that this will become another Rwanda?



LIEBERMAN: They're fighting for their freedom, incidentally, which is what America's supposed to be all about.



CUPP: Yes. And how -- aren't you worried this will be another Rwanda?



LIEBERMAN: This didn't start out as al Qaeda.



SANTORUM: I agree. And I called for military force 18 months ago.



CUPP: Right. As did I. As did I.



LIEBERMAN: I met with the opposition. And there -- these were patriots, Syrian patriots, freedom fighters --



SANTORUM: Agreed.



LIEBERMAN: -- who were sick of the dictator.



SANTORUM: Agreed.



LIEBERMAN: We held back and al Qaeda came in. I don't think al Qaeda is the dominant force in the opposition. I think from all I know it's the Syrian people who want to change from Assad. And they deserve --



(CROSSTALK)



JONES: I want to give him a chance to say something, because listen, I want to double down on peace. I don't want to double down on war. I think that we have diplomatic options we haven't exhausted. My quarrel with the president all week long has been we're rushing to war.



But my problem is, I want to double down on peace; some people want to double down on war. It seems like you're doubling down on nothing. What do you want us to do?



SANTORUM: Let's -- let's --



JONES: If you were the president, what would you do?



SANTORUM: Well, first off, go back and look at the debates that occurred about 18 months ago. And I, in those debates, called for the president to intervene, to side with exactly the people that Joe Lieberman was talking about, and get involved, give them --



JONES: So we had an interest then, but we don't have an interest now?



Hold on a second. How do we have an interest then and not now?



CUPP: Everything has changed.



SANTORUM: Everything has changed. Everything has changed. The people who are the rebels in Syria right now are not the same people that we --



CUPP: That's right.



SANTORUM: That we could have been partners with 18 months ago.



LIEBERMAN: But it's not going to get better if we hang back. I mean, if we get involved in one level and support the moderates there -- and there are moderates there who are our friends -- then they'll have a better opportunity to control the country when Assad goes.



Right now, I think we've got to hang tough. And tonight, the president's got a real challenge, but -- because of all of the twists and turns of the story -- but he's got a great opportunity to tell people why he thinks it's worth us carrying out limited but decisive attacks. CUPP: What does he need to say tonight? What does he need to say tonight?



LIEBERMAN: Well, I think he needs to say, one, we can't -- we can't handle every problem in the world. But Americans, you know, we have a Declaration of Independence that talks about the self-evident truth that everybody -- not just Americans but in the world -- got from our creator the rights to life and liberty. And these people in Syria have been deprived of both of those rights.



CUPP: Right.



LIEBERMAN: But here's the point. If you let a dictator mass murder his people and you turn away from it, he's going to keep going. And every other madman is going to keep going.



CUPP: Sure. And haven't we learned this lesson?



SANTORUM: Two different -- two different lessons. First off, there are lot -- there are lots of dictators, unfortunately, in this world who are mass murdering their people. We've seen it. We've seen it under President Obama. We saw it under President Bush. It's under presidents for decades now. The United States has not stepped in unless there's a national security interest military. We've stepped in in other ways, but we have not stepped in militarily.



But the president is going to change that and say that humanitarian reasons and the reason we're going to step in and -- and engage in military conflict. We are broadening -- you want to talk about not being a cop on the beat. You want to talk about something you and folks that -- that have been advocating for us to have -- make peace not war. We've now opened up Pandora's box as to military use. It's a bad idea. It's not in the security interests.



JONES: I want -- I want you to respond to this. My quarrel with the president is I think he did two things right and one thing wrong. I think he was right to say this is an outrage, and we're not going to let babies get gassed.



CUPP: And then do nothing about it?



JONES: I think that was right. I think he was wrong to rush into a war posture without talking to Congress, without bringing in the U.N., without bringing a global coalition, without exhausting --



SANTORUM: He did that when he set the red line, with Russia. And he set the red line --



CUPP: Months ago.



JONES: And he did -- and I think he did. Because he waited -- and I'm surprised you say you wish we'd gone in -- because he waited, we now have a new opening.



Do you disagree that the president, by putting those warships out there and waiting, don't you agree he created an opening now for peace? You're saying that the president has done nothing right this whole crisis?



SANTORUM: If we believe Putin and Assad are legitimate actors in the diplomatic stage. Well, but that's who's come forward, and it's not --



CUPP: It's who we got.



SANTORUM: It's who we got. And so, look, I'm perfectly willing to let this play out. I want us to not strike Syria --



JONES: You and me both.



SANTORUM: -- because I think streaking Syria, at this point in time, will create a real problem for us militarily with Russia, with potentially others in the region.



We are taking -- and I think Joe will agree with me on this one. The whole Syria conflict at this point, has taken our eye off the ball. And the ball is Iran. Syria is a puppet state of Iran.



LIEBERMAN: That's exactly the reason why we can't let Assad get away.



CUPP: That's right. Iran is watching.



LIEBERMAN: It's the biggest body blow we could land to Iran. He's their only ally in the Arab world. And this -- even this proposal, which if it works for Russia, will be a good thing. The price of it will be that Assad will stay there, and Iran will still have its No. 1 ally in the Arab world.



CUPP: All right. Well, let's -- let's continue this over in the next -- in the next segment. There are a lot of creative solutions that don't involve bombing and killing people apparently.



Yes, there are and we'll talk about it when we get back. Thank you very much.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



JONES: Welcome back.



Tonight President Obama addresses the nation about Syria. He's hitting the pause button on the military strikes. That gives us time for some creative solutions. And we should keep the warships parked off of there. But what about helping refugees? What about an arms embargo? What about cyber-attacks, what about anything? It's all either war or nothing.



I'm going to ask you: If there were a dome over Syria, so it was not about bomb or don't bomb, what are some of the creative things we could do that don't involve war? How do we win without war?



LIEBERMAN: Unfortunately, if there were a dome over Syria, there was nothing we could do to stop the bloodshed. Because you've got a basically unfair fight here. The government has most of the fire power. Finally, the patriots, the freedom fighter Syrians, have gotten help from outside. But they're still getting decimated. So --



JONES: This is America. You're saying there's nothing we can do? It's either Tomahawk missiles or nothing? We're the most creative --



CUPP: But the dome doesn't exist, Van. The dome is fantasy land. Let's deal with reality.



JONES: The fact -- let's get with reality. We have someone here --



LIEBERMAN: Let me say something about the dome. Because the other reason it's gone --



CUPP: Van Jones Dome.



LIEBERMAN: The dome is unreal, but what that really reminds us of is that their neighbors there -- Israel, Iraq, Jordan -- they're all being -- Lebanon -- they're all being badly affected by what's going on in Syria. Our allies are.



JONES: This is a crisis in our country, of imagination. How can we get out of this without bombs. You tell us.



SANTORUM: That's why -- that's why Rick Santorum, 18 months ago, during the presidential campaign --



JONES: Today.



SANTORUM: -- said we should be arming the rebels.



CUPP: That's right.



SANTORUM: We should be supporting them militarily. We should be supporting them economically. We should be doing everything --



JONES: That's all in the past.



SANTORUM: We agree --



JONES: And now we give up. Because we didn't do what you wanted so we just give up.



SANTORUM: Because a lot of folks -- hello?



JONES: Hello?



SANTORUM: A lot of folks said no, we had no interest in this.



JONES: Hey, listen.



SANTORUM: Do you admit you were wrong?



JONES: I'll tell you what: I'm going to shock you. I think the Democrats were wrong for not taking Syria more seriously earlier. But I think it's wrong, and I'm giving you an opportunity. I don't want to go to war. I think there are a lot of things we could do that would get us out of the situation without war. You are somebody who's got some ideas about it, but I don't hear anybody talking about what can we do.



CUPP: Senator, you've said Assad -- Assad has to go. You've said Assad has to go. How do you do it without military intervention?



JONES: What can we do?



(CROSSTALK)



SANTORUM: This is very difficult right now. When you look at the rebels and the composition of the rebel forces, you see -- you're seeing on YouTube how rebel forces are, you know -- these radical al- Qaeda folks are killing off other rebel leaders and are doing atrocities to the public also.



JONES: But if you were president --



SANTORUM: You are going to say we are going to come on the side of them and help them.



JONES: That's terrible. Help us.



SANTORUM: But we can't. No, what we have to do is do what we should have done from the very beginning, which is let's identify, as we can, and support and protect and defend the legitimate elements within the rebel forces. Begin the process of arming them, protecting them, et cetera.



JONES: You agree with this?



LIEBERMAN: I totally agree. I just want to say something. You've been using the word ""war."" Nobody's talking about war. President Obama's not talking about war. He's not talking about any American boots on the ground. He's talking about limited, decisive attacks.



CUPP: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Because you are not that naive, Senator Lieberman. You know that, even though President Obama is saying no boots on the ground, if one of our planes goes down, we're sending boots on the ground.



LIEBERMAN: Yes, but that -- everybody's --



CUPP: This is a lot bigger conflict than he thinks.



LIEBERMAN: I don't believe so. It's not going to be a massive land invasion.



Incidentally, what the president could have done when he decided to send it to Congress in taking the military action limited that he has in mind, is not a precedent. President Reagan did it in Grenada and struck at Libya when he thought the Libyans blew up a disco in Germany.



You know, President Clinton went into Bosnia, and people could argue we had no national security interests there, but a lot of people were getting slaughtered --



CUPP: Right.



LIEBERMAN: -- by the Serbs at that point. And it goes on and on. So --



JONES: I'm glad the president went to Congress. I think the president going to Congress is the best thing that happened, because it gave us time. You don't agree with me.



LIEBERMAN: No. Here's my concern when he did it. I don't think he had to do it. He himself said, and I think he was right, that he had the legal authority to take action himself as commander in chief under the War Powers Resolution, everything else. He took an enormous risk, and unfortunately, he's in a quagmire now, because the risk was that Congress would say no.



JONES: Well, now they're both being delayed, and the U.N. is -- the U.N. is now a forum where -- I don't understand why you can say it's a bad thing. The delay gave us time.



CUPP: Don't worry. The U.N.'s on it.



SANTORUM: You may have not seen the polls. I'm not a great poll- watcher. But the American public is overwhelmingly against the president. The president's been making this case now for several weeks. They are against military action. They do not see any positive benefit for the United States in getting involved in a war between two radical elements of which neither are our friends.



LIEBERMAN: Now I want to -- I want to quote you -- I'm quoting from the New Testament, Corinthians: ""When the sound of the trumpet is uncertain, who will follow into battle?"" So I think people are so confused about what's going on here. If --



SANTORUM: The president says he has to do it, but then he goes to Congress.



LIEBERMAN: If you looked at the polls earlier, there was authority for a limited strike without American boots on the ground, particularly if we had some support from other --



CUPP: Let me ask you, Senator -- go ahead.



SANTORUM: Here's the president says we need to do it, but I'm going to ask Congress. We need to strike, but it's not going to be decisive. Of course, the American people is going to say what the heck are we doing here?



Because here's the problem: If we actually do act, and if the Russians or the Iranians or somebody else say, ""You know what? You've drawn a line in the sand for us and we're going to -- we're going to act back,"" now we've put the United States in a much broader war with a president who is clearly over his head.



JONES: Listen, I don't -- I do not agree the president is in over his head. First of all, let's be clear. This is a president who built a -- he built a coalition to --



SANTORUM: Really?



JONES: Let me finish. He isolated Iran.



SANTORUM: A coalition?



JONES: Let's walk through the list before we take him down too hard. He got -- he got Russia and China to be with us against Iran.



SANTORUM: Stop right there. Stop. Whoa!



LIEBERMAN: Forget Libya.



JONES: Libya.



SANTORUM: Stop at Iran. Is Iran pursuing the nuclear weapons program? They have not drawn down.



JONES: The answer is -- Do you want a war? Do you want a war?



SANTORUM: We have drawn a red line.



JONES: Yes. We're doing cyber-attacks. We're doing an embargo.



SANTORUM: We have drawn a red line with Iran, and we have done nothing publicly.



CUPP: Let me ask you. This is a very good opportunity --



(CROSSTALK)



CUPP: This is a very good opportunity -- very good opportunity to talk about the U.N. The U.N. -- no one, maybe except Van, trusts the Russians in this new plan to seize chemical weapons from Assad. But I fear that a lot of people trust the U.N. to do that.



The U.N. does not have a terribly impressive track record when it comes to ending conflicts. Are you worried? Should the American people trust U.N. to oversee this new Russian plan?



LIEBERMAN: The U.N. works sometimes. Other times it doesn't. The record is mixed. The question is what passes in the U.N.? If, as France --



CUPP: Well, nothing if you're Russia and China.



LIEBERMAN: France tabled a resolution in the Security Council today that basically embraced the Russian proposal that the Syrians get rid of their chemical weapons with international supervision and said that, if they didn't, then force was authorized by the U.N. Security Council. I thought that was great, because it called -- called Russia's bluff.



And what do you think Russia did? They said that was unacceptable. They don't want a mandatory resolution with teeth in it. They want it to be a presidential statement of kind of appealing to Syria.



CUPP: Senator Santorum, do you trust the U.N.?



SANTORUM: It calls into question Russia's credibility with this entire proposal.



CUPP: Do you trust -- wait, let me ask. Do you trust the U.N.?



JONES: Hold on.



SANTORUM: Pick an issue. The answer is no.



CUPP: Exactly right.



JONES: A hundred and seventy-two successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations for some. Listen, we always focus -- 172 --



CUPP: Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Rwanda, Bosnia --



JONES: The world is a tough, nasty place, and we focus on the places the U.N. has not been able to change human nature. But we are in a much safer world because of the U.N. than we would be without it.



CUPP: That is not -- that is a total inaccuracy.



JONES: Look right here: 172 peacekeeping --



CUPP: I have a list, too, of atrocities that they have taken responsibility for and not changed. The world feels very good about itself when it allows the U.N. to take over, because it feels like it's doing something. It's false security.



JONES: Well, listen -- Here's what I don't understand. When George W. Bush brought in the United Nations, people thought that was a good thing. He was trying to bring in the global community. I thought that you wanted us to build a big global coalition. I think we have a moment now to do so.



And why do we have it? We have it for two reasons. One, he went to Congress, which you don't like. And two, because as much as we do not trust the Russians for their own interests, they are moving. Why are you mad at Congress and the U.N.?



(CROSSTALK)



SANTORUM: Name -- name the countries that are for the United States getting involved militarily in Syria.



JONES: Well, apparently, there's France. Militarily?



LIEBERMAN: The people that want us to --



(CROSSTALK)



JONES: You can answer that.



LIEBERMAN: There's about 15 that signed that statement calling for action.



SANTORUM: Action but not military action.



LIEBERMAN: But you know what? The president has --



SANTORUM: There's a big difference between action and military action. I'm for action. I'm just not for -- I'm not for a military strike. Particularly one that's not decisive and is not going to accomplish anything.



LIEBERMAN: But here's the problem. I think a military strike today will hurt Assad. I think that's the reason why, at least in words, he's accepted this Russian proposal.



I don't believe him for a minute. I'll believe it when I see it, when he gives us his chemical weapons.



SANTORUM: Let's play it out.



LIEBERMAN: But I think he's scared of a strike. We're going to hit his command and control.



SANTORUM: Let's play it out. We strike Assad. We -- we knock out a few command and control operations. Then where do we go?



LIEBERMAN: Then we give more support to the Syrian opposition. Because they will have a tremendous boost in morale.



SANTORUM: Why can't we do that without striking?



LIEBERMAN: We can, but we've got to strike him because he used chemical weapons. And if we don't, then he'll use them again.



SANTORUM: And you don't have any -- you don't have any fear or concern that any other country will, as a result of us striking Syria, do something to -- to insert themselves even in that conflict or potentially against the United States?



LIEBERMAN: They might but you know, when you're -- we can't -- we can't act out of fear of what might happen. We're strong. We're still the strongest country in the world.



SANTORUM: We're not. We're not acting like -- we're not acting like a leader. We're not acting strong. We're acting like someone who said, don't knock this off my shoulder and you do. And so I -- OK, so I've got a fight back. We have to have --



(CROSSTALK)



LIEBERMAN: The shoulder was the high moral ground about --



SANTORUM: It wasn't a high moral ground.



LIEBERMAN: Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Assad have used chemical weapons.



SANTORUM: Chemical weapons -- LIEBERMAN: You've got to say no.



SANTORUM: Chemical weapons is very different than WMD that Iran is working on. That's where we should focus our attention.



CUPP: OK. Thanks to Joe Lieberman and Rick Santorum. It was a great debate. We appreciate it.



Next, we ""Cease Fire."" There's something important here we need to agree on. Not just the two of us but the whole country.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



JONES: Tonight on CROSSFIRE, we've been debating and fighting about what to do about Syria. But now we're going to call a ""Cease Fire.""



Now I think, and I want to come back to a point I made. I think that I have to admit that you guys have been right about something. You guys have been out, you in particular, out there for two years saying we've got to do something about Syria, something about Syria.



I hate your solution.



CUPP: Yes.



JONES: I don't like the war. But you are pointing to the right problem. And I think a lot of people on the left were ducking it, and we weren't dealing with it. And I think that what my lesson out of this is, even when we don't agree, we've got to listen to each other more than we did.



CUPP: Well, and I appreciate that. And I will return a favor and say, look, I don't agree with your solutions either, but at least you've been consistent. I think a lot of Democrats and liberals have talked about President Obama's foreign policy as somehow morally superior to President Bush's. And you hold Obama to the same standard as you hold President Bush, and that -- that says a lot about your credibility.



JONES: Here we go. The two of us, we agreed, and the world didn't come to an end.



CUPP: Here's another thing we agree on: Your opinion matters. You can weigh in on our ""Fire Back"" question via Facebook or Twitter. ""Should the U.S. trust Russia's offer to rid Syria of chemical weapons?"" Right now 41 percent of you say yes; 59 percent say no.



JONES: The debate continues online at CNN.com/crossfire. You can also go to Facebook and Twitter.



From the left, I'm Van Jones.



CUPP: and from the right, I'm S.C. Cupp. Join us tomorrow for another edition of CROSSFIRE.



A special edition of ""ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT"" starts right now.

Phoenix, Arizona

1:00 P.M. MST

THE PRESIDENT: Hey! Hello, Phoenix! (Applause.) Hello, Arizona! (Applause.) It is --

AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Obama!

THE PRESIDENT: I love you back. It is good to be here. (Applause.)

I want to say thank you to the Thunder for hosting us here today. (Applause.) Well, we are so glad to be here. I want you to give it up for somebody whoÃ¢ÂÂs been fighting for homeowners and working families every single day, whoÃ¢ÂÂs with me today -- Secretary Shaun Donovan, Secretary of HUD. There he is right there. Give him a big round of applause. (Applause.) WeÃ¢ÂÂve got Congressman Ed Pastor whoÃ¢ÂÂs here as well. (Applause.) WeÃ¢ÂÂve got your Mayor, Greg Stanton, here. (Applause.) Doing an outstanding job. And to all the mayors and state legislators and tribal leaders who are here today, thank you. (Applause.)

Give Jorge a big round of applause for his introduction. (Applause.) To your superintendent, Dr. Kenneth Baca. (Applause.) Your principal, Dr. Anna Battle. (Applause.) And I appreciate everybody at Desert Vista for having me here today. (Applause.) It is good to see the students are pretty enthusiastic about being back in school. (Laughter.) IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure I would have been that enthusiastic starting on the 6th. (Laughter.)

And I know this isnÃ¢ÂÂt your typical school -- second day of school. So I want to give a special shout-out to the new seniors, class of 2014. (Applause.) You are aware that youÃ¢ÂÂre not finished yet. (Laughter.) Senior year, thatÃ¢ÂÂs sometimes tempting. I want you all to stay focused.

Over the past couple weeks, I have been --

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Happy birthday, Mr. President!

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) It was my birthday two days ago. (Laughter.) Got some singers here.

AUDIENCE: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday, Mr. President. (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) I am now 52, and Michelle says that I donÃ¢ÂÂt look a day over 51. (Laughter.)

So over the last few weeks, IÃ¢ÂÂve been visiting towns all across the country, talking about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class -- a national strategy to make sure that everybody who works hard has a chance to succeed in the 21st century economy.

And I think people in Arizona especially understand the challenges that are out there, because for the past four and a half years, together, we fought our way back from a devastating recession that cost millions of jobs for Americans. A lot of folks lost their homes; a lot of folks lost their savings. And what the recession showed was the long erosion of middle-class security that had been taking place for decades.

But we fought back. We took on a broken health care system. We took on a housing market that was in free fall. We invested in new technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We changed a tax code that had become tilted a little bit too much in favor of the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working families. (Applause.) We saved the auto industry. WeÃ¢ÂÂve now got GM that plans to hire a thousand new workers right next door in Chandler to make sure weÃ¢ÂÂre building some of the best cars in the world right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)

Our businesses have created 7.3 million new jobs over the past 41 months. We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. Our exports are way up. We produce more renewable energy than ever before, more natural gas than anybody else. Health care costs have been growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And our deficits are coming down at the fastest rate in 60 years. So weÃ¢ÂÂre making progress. (Applause.)

So thanks to the efforts of a lot of people like you, weÃ¢ÂÂve cleared away the rubble of the financial crisis. WeÃ¢ÂÂre starting to lay the foundation for more stable, more durable economic growth. But as any middle-class family will tell you, weÃ¢ÂÂre not yet where we need to be. Because even before the crisis hit, we had lived through a decade where a few at the top were doing better and better, but most families were working harder and harder just to get by.

And reversing this trend should be -- must be -- WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂs highest priority. ItÃ¢ÂÂs my highest priority. (Applause.) I want to make sure that in America, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love -- you should be able to make it when you try. You should be able to make it. (Applause.)

Now, unfortunately, for the last year or so, weÃ¢ÂÂve had an endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals that shift focus away from what do we need to do to shore up middle-class families and create ladders of opportunity for folks to get into the middle class. And as Washington heads towards another budget debate, the stakes could not be higher.

And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂm traveling around, laying out my ideas for how we have to build the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class: a good job with good wages; a home to call your own; a good education; affordable health care thatÃ¢ÂÂs there for you when you get sick; a secure retirement even if youÃ¢ÂÂre not rich; the opportunity -- the ladders of opportunity for people to earn their way into the middle class, to work their way out of poverty. Those are the elements that I think all of us believe in, but right now we're not delivering as much as we should on those promises.

Now, last Tuesday, I went to Tennessee to talk about the first cornerstone, which is how do we make sure that we're creating good middle-class jobs here in the United States of America. Today I've come to Phoenix to talk about the second component, which is the most tangible cornerstone that lies at the heart of the American Dream, at the heart of middle-class life -- and that's the chance to own your own home. (Applause.) The chance to own your own home.

We've got a lot of young people here who are thinking about college, they're going to get a higher education, they're going to find a job, they're going to find somebody they love, they're going to want to own a home. And the reason they will is because a home is the ultimate evidence that here in America, hard work pays off, that responsibility is rewarded.

I think about my grandparentsÃ¢ÂÂ generation. When my grandfather served in World War II, he fought in Patton's Army -- when he got back, this country gave him a chance to go to college on the G.I. Bill, but it also gave him the chance to buy his first home with a loan from the FHA. To him, and to generations of Americans before and since, a home was more than just a house. It was a source of pride and a source of security. It was a place to raise kids, to put down roots; a place where you could build up savings for college, or to start a business, or to retire with some security.

And buying a home required responsibility on everybodyÃ¢ÂÂs part. You had to save up to buy a home. And then banks were supposed to give you a fair deal, with terms you could understand, and buyers were supposed to live within their means and make sure that they could make their payments. So in that earlier generation, houses werenÃ¢ÂÂt for flipping around, they werenÃ¢ÂÂt for speculation -- houses were to live in, and to build a life with.

And unfortunately, over time, responsibility too often gave way to recklessness. You had reckless lenders who sold loans to people they knew couldnÃ¢ÂÂt afford them. And let's face it, we also had some reckless buyers who knew they couldnÃ¢ÂÂt afford them and still took out loans. And all this created a housing bubble. And especially in some places like Arizona, it was devastating when that bubble finally burst -- triggered a recession. Millions of Americans who had done everything right were hurt badly by the actions of other people. Housing prices plummeted.

By the time I took office, home values had fallen almost 20 percent from the year before. New housing starts had fallen nearly 80 percent from their peak. Hundreds of thousands of construction workers had lost their jobs. A record number of people were behind on their mortgage payments. And a lot of people here in Phoenix, they saw that devastation. This was part of Ground Zero for the housing bubble bursting.

So less than a month after I took office, I came here to Arizona and I laid out steps to stabilize the housing market and help responsible homeowners get back on their feet. And the truth is it's been a long, slow process. The housing market is so big that it was going to take some time to heal when it got hurt that badly. It's taken longer than any of us would like. But during that time, we helped millions of Americans save an average of $3,000 each year by refinancing at lower rates. We helped millions of responsible homeowners stay in their homes, which was good for their neighbors because you don't want a bunch of foreclosure signs in your neighborhood.

Where Congress wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt act, we went ahead and acted, so over the past few years, we had the Department of Justice stand up for buyers who had been discriminated against or conned by predatory lending. And we won a settlement that gave more money to victims of discrimination in one year than in the previous 23 years combined. (Applause.)

We worked with states to force big banks to repay more than $50 billion to more than 1.5 million families -- largest lending settlement in history. (Applause.) We extended the time that folks who had lost their jobs could delay their payment on their mortgages while they kept looking for work. We cracked down on the bad practices that led to the crisis in the first place. I mean, you had some loans back there in the bubble that were called Ã¢ÂÂliarÃ¢ÂÂs loan.Ã¢ÂÂ Now, something that's called a liar's loan is probably a bad idea. (Laughter.)

So because of all these actions we've been taking, our housing market is beginning to heal. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in seven years. Sales are up nearly 50 percent. Construction is up nearly 75 percent. New foreclosures are down by nearly two-thirds. Millions of families have been able to come up for air -- theyÃ¢ÂÂre no longer underwater on their mortgages. (Applause.)

And just like the crisis hit Phoenix very hard, thanks to some great leadership here locally, Phoenix has also led one of the biggest comebacks in the country. (Applause.) So you should be proud of what you've done here. Home prices in Phoenix have risen by nearly 20 percent over the last year. New home sales are up by more than 25 percent.

This morning, right before I came here, I visited Erickson Construction -- (applause.) We've got some Erickson folks here. And they were explaining how right when the bubble hit, Erickson shrank to less than a hundred workers. Today they're employing 580 people -- and theyÃ¢ÂÂre hiring even more people -- (applause) -- because the housing market is bouncing back.

So that's one of the things about housing. It's not just important for the person who owns the house; our economy is so impacted by everything that happens in housing. Consumers feel better when their home values are in a better place, so they're more willing to spend. A lot of people who want to start a business, their savings may be locked up in their house. Construction workers, contractors, suppliers, carpet makers, all these folks are impacted by the housing industry.

So we've made progress, and that's helped to move the economy forward. But we've got to build on this progress. We're not where we need to be yet. We've got to give more hardworking Americans the chance to buy their first home. (Applause.) We have to help more responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages, because a lot of them still have a spread between the rates they're paying right now on their mortgage and what they could be getting if they were able to refinance.

And weÃ¢ÂÂve got to turn the page on this kind of bubble-and-bust mentality that helped to create this mess in the first place. (Applause.) We got to build a housing system that is durable and fair and rewards responsibility for generations to come. That's what weÃ¢ÂÂve got to do. (Applause.)

So IÃ¢ÂÂve already put forward a bunch of ideas that will help accomplish that. And, look, the fact of the matter is Congress hasnÃ¢ÂÂt enacted all of them, so IÃ¢ÂÂd like you to encourage members of Congress to take some of these actions. (Applause.)

But like the other actions that weÃ¢ÂÂve taken, these will not help the neighbors down the street who bought a house that they couldnÃ¢ÂÂt afford, and then walked away from it and left a foreclosed home behind. We don't want to help speculators who bought multiple homes just to make a quick buck.

What we want to do is put forward ideas that will help millions of responsible, middle-class homeowners who still need relief. And we want to help hardworking Americans who dream of owning their own home fair and square, have a down payment, are willing to make those payments, understand that owning a home requires responsibility. And there are some immediate actions we could take right now that would help on that front, that would make a difference. So let me just list a couple of them.

Number one: Congress should pass a good, bipartisan idea to allow every homeowner the chance to save thousands of dollars a year by refinancing their mortgage at todayÃ¢ÂÂs rates. (Applause.) We need to get that done. WeÃ¢ÂÂve been talking about it for a year and a half, two years, three years. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no reason not to do it. (Applause.)

Step number two: Now that weÃ¢ÂÂve made it harder for reckless buyers to buy homes that they canÃ¢ÂÂt afford, letÃ¢ÂÂs make it a little bit easier for qualified buyers to buy the homes that they can afford. (Applause.) So Shaun Donovan has been working with the finance industry to make sure weÃ¢ÂÂre simplifying overlapping regulations; weÃ¢ÂÂre cutting red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but keep getting rejected by the banks. We need to give well-qualified Americans who lost their jobs during the crisis a fair chance to get a loan if theyÃ¢ÂÂve worked hard to repair their credit.

And step three is something that you donÃ¢ÂÂt always hear about when it comes to the housing market, and that is fixing our broken immigration system. It would actually help our housing market. (Applause.)

ItÃ¢ÂÂs pretty simple: When more people buy homes and play by the rules, home values go up for everybody. And according to one recent study, the average homeowner has already seen the value of their home boosted by thousands of dollars just because of immigration. And the good news is, with the help of your Senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, the Senate has already passed a bipartisan immigration bill. ItÃ¢ÂÂs got the support of CEOs and labor and law enforcement. (Applause.) This could help homeownership here.

So I want you to encourage Republicans in the House of Representatives to stop dragging their feet. LetÃ¢ÂÂs go ahead and get this done.

Step number four: We should address the uneven recovery by rebuilding the communities hit the hardest by the housing crisis, including many right here in Arizona. LetÃ¢ÂÂs put construction back -- construction workers back to work repairing rundown homes, tearing down vacant properties so that the value of homes in those surrounding areas start picking up. We can put people to work right now and improve the remaining housing stock that's out there. (Applause.) Places that are facing a longer road back from the crisis should have their countryÃ¢ÂÂs help to get back on their feet.

Step five: We should make sure families that donÃ¢ÂÂt want to buy a home or canÃ¢ÂÂt yet afford to buy one still have a decent place to rent. (Applause.) ItÃ¢ÂÂs important for us to encourage homeownership, but a lot of people rent and thereÃ¢ÂÂs nothing wrong with renting. And we got to make sure that we are creating affordable opportunities when it comes to rental properties.

In the run-up to the crisis, banks and governments too often made everybody feel like they had to own a home, even if they werenÃ¢ÂÂt ready and didn't have the payments. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a mistake we should not repeat. Instead, letÃ¢ÂÂs invest in affordable rental housing. LetÃ¢ÂÂs bring together cities and states to address local barriers that drive up rents for working families. (Applause.)

So if we help more Americans refinance their homes, if we help qualified families get a mortgage, we reform our immigration system, we rebuild the hardest-hit communities, we make sure that folks have a decent place to rent if they're not yet able to buy -- all these steps will give more middle-class families the chance to either buy their own home now or eventually buy their own home. It's going to give more relief to responsible homeowners. It gives more options to families who arenÃ¢ÂÂt yet ready to buy. All that is going to improve the housing market and will improve the economy.

But -- and this is the last key point I want to make -- as home prices rise, we canÃ¢ÂÂt just re-inflate another housing bubble. I hope everybody here in Arizona learned some hard lessons from what happened. Housing prices generally don't just keep on going up forever at the kind of pace it was going up. It was crazy. So what we want to do is something stable and steady. And that's why I want to lay a rock-solid foundation to make sure the kind of crisis we went through never happens again. We've got to make sure it doesn't happen again. (Applause.)

And one of the key things to make sure it doesn't happen again is to wind down these companies that are not really government, but not really private sector -- they're known as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. For too long, these companies were allowed to make huge profits buying mortgages, knowing that if their bets went bad, taxpayers would be left holding the bag. It was Ã¢ÂÂheads we win, tails you lose.Ã¢ÂÂ And it was wrong. And along with what happened on Wall Street, it helped to inflate this bubble in a way that ultimately killed Main Street.

So the good news is, right now thereÃ¢ÂÂs a bipartisan group of senators working to end Fannie and Freddie as we know them. And I support these kinds of reform efforts. And they're following four core principles for what I believe this reform should look like.

First, private capital should take a bigger role in the mortgage market. I know that sounds confusing to folks who call me a socialist -- I think I saw some posters there on the way in. (Laughter.) But I actually believe in the free market. And just like the health care law that we put in place, Obamacare -- (applause) -- which, by the way, if you don't have health insurance or you're buying it at exorbitant rates on the individual market, starting on October 1st, you can join a marketplace and be part of a pool that gives you much lower premiums, saves you a lot of money. (Applause.)

But in the same way that what we did with health care was to set up clear rules for insurance companies to protect consumers, make it more affordable, but still built on the private marketplace, I believe that our housing system should operate where there's a limited government role and private lending should be the backbone of the housing market. And that includes, by the way, community-based lenders who view their borrowers not as a number, but as a neighbor. So that's one principle.

A second principle is we can't leave taxpayers on the hook for irresponsibility or bad decisions by some of these lenders or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. (Applause.) We've got to encourage the pursuit of profit, but the era of expecting a bailout after you pursue your profit and you don't manage your risk well -- well, that puts the whole country at risk. And we're ending those days. We're not going to do that anymore. (Applause.)

The third principle is we should preserve access to safe and simple mortgage products like the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs something families should be able to rely on when they're making the most important purchase of their lives. (Applause.)

Number four, we've got to keep housing affordable for first-time homebuyers -- like all these young people. When they're ready to buy a house, we've got to make sure it's affordable. Families who are working to climb their way into the middle class, we've got to do what we can to make housing affordable. And that means we've got to strengthen the FHA so it gives todayÃ¢ÂÂs families the same kind of chance it gave my grandparents to buy a home, and it preserves those rungs on the ladder of opportunity.

And we've got to support, as I said, affordable rental housing. And, by the way, we've also got to keep up our fight against homelessness. (Applause.) The Mayor of Phoenix has been doing a great job here in Phoenix on that front. We've got to continue to improve it. (Applause.)

Since I took office, we helped bring one in four homeless veterans off the streets. (Applause.) We should be proud of that. Here in Phoenix, thanks to the hard work of everyone from Mayor Stanton to the local United Way to US Airways, youÃ¢ÂÂre on track to end chronic homelessness for veterans, period, by 2014. (Applause.)

But we've got to keep going, because nobody in America, and certainly no veteran, should be left to live on the streets. (Applause.)

So here's the bottom line: Put all these principles together, that's going to protect our entire economy and it will improve the housing market not just here in Phoenix, but throughout the state and throughout the country.

We're also going to need to make sure, though, that we're protecting individual homeowners. We've got to give them the tools that they can protect themselves. So we've got a Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that we created. (Applause.) And it's laying down new rules of the road that everybody can count on when theyÃ¢ÂÂre shopping for a mortgage. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre designing a new, simple mortgage form that will be in plain English, so you can actually read it without a lawyer -- (applause) -- although, you may still want a lawyer obviously. I'm not saying you don't. I'm just saying you'll be able to read it. (Laughter.) There won't be a lot of fine print. That way you know before you owe. (Laughter and applause.)

And the Senate finally confirmed Richard Cordray as the head of this -- head watchdog for the CFPB. (Applause.) So he's out there aggressively protecting consumers and homeowners.

When it comes to some of the other leaders we need to look out for the American people, the Senate still has a job to do. Months ago, I nominated a man named Mel Watt to be our nationÃ¢ÂÂs top housing regulator. He is an outstanding member of Congress. And during that time, he was on the Housing Committee -- worked with banks, worked with borrowers to protect consumers, to help responsible lenders provide credit. He is the right person for the job. Congress and the Senate should give his nomination an up or down vote without any more obstruction or delay. We don't have time for those kinds of games. (Applause.)

So I want to be honest with you. No program or policy is going to solve all the problems in a multi-trillion dollar housing market. The housing bubble went up so high, the heights it reached before it burst were so unsustainable, that we knew it was going to take some time for us to fully recover. But if we take the steps that I talked about today, then I know we will restore not just our home values, but also our common values. WeÃ¢ÂÂll make owning a home a symbol of responsibility, not speculation -- a source of security for generations to come, just like it was for my grandparents. I want it to be just like that for all the young people who are here today and their children and their grandchildren. (Applause.)

And if we stay focused on middle-class security and opportunities to get into the middle class, if we take the strategy that I'm laying out for the entire economy -- for jobs and housing and education, health care, retirement, creating ladders of opportunity -- then we will secure that better bargain for all Americans, where hard work is once again rewarded with a shot at a middle-class life, which means more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will know the satisfaction of flipping the sign to Ã¢ÂÂOpenÃ¢ÂÂ on their own business. More Americans will know the joy of scratching the childÃ¢ÂÂs height on the door of their new home -- with pencil, of course. (Laughter.)

We can do all this if we work together. And it wonÃ¢ÂÂt be easy. But if we take just a few bold steps -- and if Washington will just end the gridlock, set aside the slash-and-burn partisanship -- (applause) -- actually try to solve problems instead of scoring political points, our economy will grow stronger a year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now. (Applause.)

And as long as I've got the privilege to serve as your President, that's what I'm going to be fighting for.

Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. (Applause.)

Battling for Iraq



BYLINE: David H. Petraeus



SECTION: Editorial; B07



LENGTH: 1239 words



DATELINE: BAGHDAD

Helping organize, train and equip nearly a quarter-million of Iraq's security forces is a daunting task. Doing so in the middle of a tough insurgency increases the challenge enormously, making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight -- and while being shot at. Now, however, 18 months after entering Iraq, I see tangible progress. Iraqi security elements are being rebuilt from the ground up.

The institutions that oversee them are being reestablished from the top down. And Iraqi leaders are stepping forward, leading their country and their security forces courageously in the face of an enemy that has shown a willingness to do anything to disrupt the establishment of the new Iraq.

In recent months, I have observed thousands of Iraqis in training and then watched as they have conducted numerous operations. Although there have been reverses -- not to mention horrific terrorist attacks -- there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do. The future undoubtedly will be full of difficulties, especially in places such as Fallujah. We must expect setbacks and recognize that not every soldier or policeman we help train will be equal to the challenges ahead.

Nonetheless, there are reasons for optimism. Today approximately 164,000 Iraqi police and soldiers (of which about 100,000 are trained and equipped) and an additional 74,000 facility protection forces are performing a wide variety of security missions. Equipment is being delivered. Training is on track and increasing in capacity. Infrastructure is being repaired. Command and control structures and institutions are being reestablished.

Most important, Iraqi security forces are in the fight -- so much so that they are suffering substantial casualties as they take on more and more of the burdens to achieve security in their country. Since Jan. 1 more than 700 Iraqi security force members have been killed, and hundreds of Iraqis seeking to volunteer for the police and military have been killed as well.

Six battalions of the Iraqi regular army and the Iraqi Intervention Force are now conducting operations. Two of these battalions, along with the Iraqi commando battalion, the counterterrorist force, two Iraqi National Guard battalions and thousands of policemen recently contributed to successful operations in Najaf. Their readiness to enter and clear the Imam Ali shrine was undoubtedly a key factor in enabling Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani to persuade members of the Mahdi militia to lay down their arms and leave the shrine.

In another highly successful operation several days ago, the Iraqi counterterrorist force conducted early-morning raids in Najaf that resulted in the capture of several senior lieutenants and 40 other members of that militia, and the seizure of enough weapons to fill nearly four 71/2-ton dump trucks.

Within the next 60 days, six more regular army and six additional Intervention Force battalions will become operational. Nine more regular army battalions will complete training in January, in time to help with security missions during the Iraqi elections at the end of that month.

Iraqi National Guard battalions have also been active in recent months. Some 40 of the 45 existing battalions -- generally all except those in the Fallujah-Ramadi area -- are conducting operations on a daily basis, most alongside coalition forces, but many independently. Progress has also been made in police training. In the past week alone, some 1,100 graduated from the basic policing course and five specialty courses. By early spring, nine academies in Iraq and one in Jordan will be graduating a total of 5,000 police each month from the eight-week course, which stresses patrolling and investigative skills, substantive and procedural legal knowledge, and proper use of force and weaponry, as well as pride in the profession and adherence to the police code of conduct.

Iraq's borders are long, stretching more than 2,200 miles. Reducing the flow of extremists and their resources across the borders is critical to success in the counterinsurgency. As a result, with support from the Department of Homeland Security, specialized training for Iraq's border enforcement elements began earlier this month in Jordan.

Regional academies in Iraq have begun training as well, and more will come online soon. In the months ahead, the 16,000-strong border force will expand to 24,000 and then 32,000. In addition, these forces will be provided with modern technology, including vehicle X-ray machines, explosive-detection devices and ground sensors.

Outfitting hundreds of thousands of new Iraqi security forces is difficult and complex, and many of the units are not yet fully equipped. But equipment has begun flowing. Since July 1, for example, more than 39,000 weapons and 22 million rounds of ammunition have been delivered to Iraqi forces, in addition to 42,000 sets of body armor, 4,400 vehicles, 16,000 radios and more than 235,000 uniforms.

Considerable progress is also being made in the reconstruction and refurbishing of infrastructure for Iraq's security forces. Some $1 billion in construction to support this effort has been completed or is underway, and five Iraqi bases are already occupied by entire infantry brigades.

Numbers alone cannot convey the full story. The human dimension of this effort is crucial. The enemies of Iraq recognize how much is at stake as Iraq reestablishes its security forces. Insurgents and foreign fighters continue to mount barbaric attacks against police stations, recruiting centers and military installations, even though the vast majority of the population deplores such attacks. Yet despite the sensational attacks, there is no shortage of qualified recruits volunteering to join Iraqi security forces. In the past couple of months, more than 7,500 Iraqi men have signed up for the army and are preparing to report for basic training to fill out the final nine battalions of the Iraqi regular army. Some 3,500 new police recruits just reported for training in various locations. And two days after the recent bombing on a street outside a police recruiting location in Baghdad, hundreds of Iraqis were once again lined up inside the force protection walls at another location -- where they were greeted by interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi.

I meet with Iraqi security force leaders every day. Though some have given in to acts of intimidation, many are displaying courage and resilience in the face of repeated threats and attacks on them, their families and their comrades. I have seen their determination and their desire to assume the full burden of security tasks for Iraq.

There will be more tough times, frustration and disappointment along the way. It is likely that insurgent attacks will escalate as Iraq's elections approach. Iraq's security forces are, however, developing steadily and they are in the fight. Momentum has gathered in recent months. With strong Iraqi leaders out front and with continued coalition -- and now NATO -- support, this trend will continue. It will not be easy, but few worthwhile things are.

154	"I recently completed a very short interview on Vatican Radio to discuss the current battle between the Obama administration and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. It didnÃ¢ÂÂt permit me to say more than that the Obama administration is making a political mistake, so IÃ¢ÂÂd like to say a bit more about the serious consequences that will likely result and how we ended up with this Church-State conundrum in the first place.

As Dr. Donald Condit has already explained, the Obama administration seems to be making a political calculation that this controversy will blow over before the NovemberÃ¢ÂÂs presidential election, because the conscience exemption for providing and paying for abortion, sterilization, and contraception will not take effect until later next year. But the miscalculation was predictable and is now evident, with not only Catholics, but Orthodox, evangelical, Jewish and other religious leaders taking a stand. Unless the administration relents or the Obamacare law is ruled unconstitutional, Catholic hospitals and other institutions will be faced with a choice between not providing insurance coverage to their employees Ã¢ÂÂ and thereby being fined by the government Ã¢ÂÂ or pay for the provision of services that they believe are morally evil.

A journalist friend in Rome just raised an alternative reading of the story to me on the street. What if Obama is actually making a principled argument that abortion, sterilization, and contraception services are a fundamental aspect of womenÃ¢ÂÂs health that cannot and should not be denied to anyone, regardless of their own religious or individual convictions? Perhaps the White House believes, as most progressives do, that these stodgy, uptight opponents will eventually, inevitably, be overcome, and we will one day wonder what all the fuss about. If so, the administration is doing much more than thinking about the next election; itÃ¢ÂÂs redefining what the word Ã¢ÂÂhealthÃ¢ÂÂ means to include measures that violently take away life from the most innocent and vulnerable persons, regardless of who pays for the services. This makes it much more than a religious freedom or a conscience issue and a matter of simple justice.

More generally, the whole Obamacare mess is a result of employer-provided health insurance. We would all be better off if our health insurance was decoupled from our employment, and we were free to purchase our own insurance according to our needs and wants. It is a result of state intervention in the economy, namely wage-and-price controls, that led to employers offering health insurance as a non-wage benefit to entice desired employees to their companies. Now we have the government mandating that all employers must provide comprehensive coverage to all their employees. What was once a prudential individual decision has become a government-mandated Ã¢ÂÂrightÃ¢ÂÂ that trumps the employer-employee, the doctor-patient, and perhaps even the priest-penitent relationship. Some progress.

There is some tragic irony to all this. We should not forget that many religious leaders have long-supported increasing the role of the state in health care and the economy at-large, perhaps thinking that conscience clauses would protect their institutions against any undue interference. Well, they were wrong; what the state giveth, the state taketh away. If you invite the state to Ã¢ÂÂassistÃ¢ÂÂ more and more of your activities, it will eventually start telling you how to do things. Encouraging the Democratic PartyÃ¢ÂÂs efforts from Harry Truman on to socialize the healthcare system of the United States is likely to have dire consequences for Catholic and other religious-based social service providers. Economic ignorance among religious leaders comes at a very high cost to their own good works."	0

158	"Gun control advocates often cite the statistic that 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases.

President Barack Obama just did it in his Jan. 1, 2016, weekly address.

But conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham says that statistic is not accurate.

""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked,"" Ingraham said on Fox News Sunday on Jan. 3. ""Lots of the myths about gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the Second Amendment in the first place and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in Washington, D.C.""

PolitiFact has rated this 90 percent statistic True as recently as October. So we decided to try and figure out what Ingraham was talking about when she said this is a myth that has been debunked.

Go to the polls

Under current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers.

National polls conducted in 2015 consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples:

Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20: ""Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?"" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.

CBS/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25: ""Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.

Gallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11: ""Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?"" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent.

Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.

Pew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20: Do you favor or oppose ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks""? Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/Refused: 2 percent.

Pew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not.

So are all of these polls wrong? We reached out to IngrahamÃ¢ÂÂs producers and didnÃ¢ÂÂt hear back.

We couldnÃ¢ÂÂt find any sort of definitive debunking of this stat, but we did find that some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation.

For example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll.

Some gun rights activists took this as proof that the 90 percent figure was phooey.

This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control.

The same October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict.

""People don't seem to like the idea of Ã¢ÂÂgun control,Ã¢ÂÂ but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America.

Our ruling

Ingraham said, ""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked.""

Numerous respected polls from 2015 show around 90 percent support for some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases.

While there are some questions as to what inferences can be made from these findings Ã¢ÂÂ such as whether that 90-percent support translates into support for specific legislation Ã¢ÂÂ there hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been a definitive debunking of the statistic.

We rate IngrahamÃ¢ÂÂs claim False."	0

161	"A nurse from Tennessee died saving his wifeÃ¢ÂÂs life in the mass shooting at a Las Vegas music concert Sunday night, according to reports.

Sonny Melton, 29, was fatally gunned down protecting wife Heather from the hail of bullets shooter Stephen Paddock rained down on the Route 91 music festival, his wife said.

Ã¢ÂÂHe saved my life,Ã¢ÂÂ Heather Gulish Melton told USA Today. Ã¢ÂÂHe grabbed me from behind and started running when I felt him get shot in the back.

Ã¢ÂÂAt this point, IÃ¢ÂÂm in complete disbelief and despair. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know what to say. Sonny was the most kind-hearted, loving man I have ever met,Ã¢ÂÂ she added in a statement to radio station WCYB.

The couple both worked at the Henry County Medical Center in Paris, Tenn. Ã¢ÂÂ he was a registered nurse and she is an orthopedic surgeon, the hospital said in a statement.

Melton Ã¢ÂÂchecked inÃ¢ÂÂ at the event on his Facebook page Friday night Ã¢ÂÂ and condolences flooded the postÃ¢ÂÂs comments thread Monday.

Days before, his wife had posted a photo of the smiling couple wearing matching Eric Church shirts Ã¢ÂÂ Route 91Ã¢ÂÂs headline act."	1

163	"To young people who are undocumented: This is your country, too. Hillary Clinton ÃÂ· Follow Published in Hillary for America ÃÂ· 5 min read ÃÂ· Aug 15, 2016 -- 13 Listen Share

Today marks four years since U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting requests for President ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. DACA provides deportation relief and two-year work permits for young people aged 15Ã¢ÂÂ30 who came to the United States as children, allowing you to live without fear of being torn away from the only country youÃ¢ÂÂve ever really known.

And thatÃ¢ÂÂs exactly who I want to talk to today: all of you whoÃ¢ÂÂve benefited from DACA, all of you who can still apply, and all of you who are still fighting for a path to citizenship for you and your families.

IÃ¢ÂÂm sure this election has been stressful for you.

It canÃ¢ÂÂt be easy to hear a presidential candidate demonize immigrant families and blame you for our nationÃ¢ÂÂs problems. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not fair, itÃ¢ÂÂs not kind, and itÃ¢ÂÂs also just not true. In every state in this country, immigrants are starting small businesses, growing our economy, and making our communities and our country stronger.

Many of you have told me how horrible it felt to be treated differently from other kids when it was time to apply for college. YouÃ¢ÂÂve told me about the feeling of knowing you couldnÃ¢ÂÂt be like your friends, even though you are just as American as they are.

I want you to feel proud of your country, and of the countless ways you have contributed to it. And I want you to feel confident in your future and your ability to achieve anything you dream. In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs what makes our country great, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the promise IÃ¢ÂÂm going to fight to fulfill.

So hereÃ¢ÂÂs my request: For all of you who are still eligible to request consideration for DACA 2012, I hope youÃ¢ÂÂll head to uscis.gov right now to learn more and apply for DACA benefits. Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible, particularly in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. I want each and every one of you to feel safe and secure in this country Ã¢ÂÂ and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what DACA can provide.

But I know thatÃ¢ÂÂs not enough Ã¢ÂÂ we have to do more for you and your families. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why as president, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office.

While we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, IÃ¢ÂÂll do everything I can to keep families together. That means defending DACA from partisan attacks and fighting to implement the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy. The Supreme CourtÃ¢ÂÂs deadlocked decision on DAPA was a heartbreaking reminder of how high the stakes are in this election. I believe DAPA is squarely within the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs authority and wonÃ¢ÂÂt stop fighting until we see it through.

So today, letÃ¢ÂÂs celebrate DACA 2012 and the more than 700,000 people itÃ¢ÂÂs helped so far Ã¢ÂÂ and letÃ¢ÂÂs also recommit to making this a safer, more welcoming country for all families, including yours.

We have always been a nation of immigrants Ã¢ÂÂ those of us whose families came here a little longer ago can sometimes forget that. But I wonÃ¢ÂÂt forget it, and I wonÃ¢ÂÂt forget you.

Thank you Ã¢ÂÂ and keep being brave,

165	"Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon will offer the H1N1 vaccination to detainees at the U.S. facility at Guantanamo Bay, officials there said Friday.

The Pentagon made the decision based on U.S. government assessments that people held in detention facilities are at high risk for the pandemic, said Maj. Diana R. Haynie, a spokeswoman for Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay, which is in charge of holding the suspected terrorists.

""Detainees at JTF Guantanamo are considered to be at higher risk and therefore they will be offered the H1N1 vaccination,"" Haynie said.

""JTF Guantanamo conducts safe, humane, legal and transparent care and custody of detainees. As such, we must provide detainees the medical care necessary to maintain their health,"" she said.

But Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, urged the Pentagon to reconsider.

""As long as Americans must wait to receive the vaccine, the detainees in Guantanamo Bay should not be given preferential treatment to receive the H1N1 vaccination,"" Stupak said in a letter to Secretary of the Army John McHugh.

""Until this shortage is addressed, I urge Pentagon officials to reconsider this decision to vaccinate terrorist detainees ahead of Americans who are waiting,"" Stupak said.

Base officials had not received the vaccinations and did not know when they were expected to arrive, Haynie said.

Once the vaccinations are received, doses will be administered to active-duty personnel before being offered to detainees and others on the base, Haynie said.

The vaccination is mandatory for all uniformed personnel, she said.

The vaccinations will be voluntary for the detainees, who will be briefed on the virus and the vaccine before they decide whether to receive the vaccine.

Some of the detainees have already voluntarily taken the seasonal flu shot, Haynie said."	0

Begin official Release:

The Ohio Art Company, a business and community leader for more than 100 years, announced today that it has sold its Etch A Sketch and Doodle Sketch brands in a move designed to allow it to focus on its metal lithography business and invest in its manufacturing operations in Bryan. Ohio ArtÃ¢ÂÂs first lithography press was installed in its Bryan, Ohio facility in 1912 and the company has since specialized in precision printing and beautiful color reproduction that is protected to withstand the rigors of stamping and fabrication. The company has been a leader in the metal lithography business for more than a century and company CEO Elena West confirms that, Ã¢ÂÂOhio Art is squarely focused on continuing to build its reputation as one of the premier metal lithographers in North America.Ã¢ÂÂ

The company also underscored its continued commitment to the Bryan, Ohio community and has been working with local business leaders to more effectively utilize its Bryan facility. G&M Media Packaging and Reece Brothers Digital Printers have both signed on as tenants and Wilton Keck Recycling has purchased warehouse space for their upstart commercial recycling business. The company is also leasing warehouse space to two local manufacturers in need of additional staging.

Ã¢ÂÂWe are very pleased to be able to partner with these local businesses to provide them with quality space and support services and, most importantly, keep these companies and jobs right here in Bryan,Ã¢ÂÂ notes Martin Killgallon, President. Ã¢ÂÂOur commitment to the community is important to our strategy and we look forward to continuing to partner with other local businesses.Ã¢ÂÂ

The Etch A Sketch and Doodle Sketch brands have been sold to Spin Master Corp., a leading global childrenÃ¢ÂÂs entertainment company that creates, designs, manufactures and markets a diversified portfolio of innovative toys, games, products and entertainment properties. Ã¢ÂÂWe are very happy that children around the world will continue to be able to enjoy Etch A Sketch, one of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs most iconic toys, as Spin Master is committed to building upon the success that The Ohio Art Company has created and sustained for more than 50 years,Ã¢ÂÂ West concludes."	0

169	"The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe.

In protesting the Trump administrationÃ¢ÂÂs policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.

Ã¢ÂÂThis is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,Ã¢ÂÂ liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted.

In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.

Ã¢ÂÂICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,Ã¢ÂÂ Fallon tweeted. Ã¢ÂÂDems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.Ã¢ÂÂ

Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.

Ã¢ÂÂThese politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,Ã¢ÂÂ Homan said Thursday on Fox NewsÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂTucker Carlson Tonight.Ã¢ÂÂ

But the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.

Ã¢ÂÂICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,Ã¢ÂÂ Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. Ã¢ÂÂBut letÃ¢ÂÂs not abuse the power.Ã¢ÂÂ

Since then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.

Ã¢ÂÂKamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,Ã¢ÂÂ Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. Ã¢ÂÂIt should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.Ã¢ÂÂ

He added: Ã¢ÂÂShe should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- Ã¢ÂÂshould be asked the same question.Ã¢ÂÂ

PELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS Ã¢ÂÂUNJUST AND CRUELÃ¢ÂÂ

The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs Time to Abolish ICE.Ã¢ÂÂ The writer accused the agency of being part of an Ã¢ÂÂunbridled white-supremacist surveillance stateÃ¢ÂÂ and called it Ã¢ÂÂan unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThough the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- itÃ¢ÂÂs time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,Ã¢ÂÂ McElwee wrote.

Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as ""unjust and cruel.""

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said SchaffÃ¢ÂÂs tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.

SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR Ã¢ÂÂRADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDAÃ¢ÂÂ

Sessions called CaliforniaÃ¢ÂÂs ""open borders"" policies a Ã¢ÂÂradical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂIt cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂHow can this be a sound policy?Ã¢ÂÂ"	1

Full transcript of the Christine OÃ¢ÂÂDonnell-Chris Coons Senate Debate

NANCY KARIBJANIAN, DELAWARE FIRST MEDIA: IÃ¢ÂÂm Nancy Karibjanian for Delaware First Media.

WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: And good evening, IÃ¢ÂÂm Wolf Blitzer from CNN.

Thank you so much for joining us for whatÃ¢ÂÂs certain to be one of the most widely watched events of this, the 2010 midterm election season.

KARIBJANIAN: LetÃ¢ÂÂs introduce the candidates. Joining us for this debate this evening, Democratic Chris Coons, welcome. And Republican Christine OÃ¢ÂÂDonnell, welcome.

CHRISTINE OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL, (R-DE) SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you.

KARIBJANIAN: We also want to thank AARP Delaware and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network for their support making this debate possible.

BLITZER: And letÃ¢ÂÂs go through some of the rules, some of the ground rules for this 90-minute debate. ItÃ¢ÂÂs divided into two parts. Following a two-minute opening statement from each candidate, Nancy and I will pose questions. Responses to that initial question limited to two minutes with a one-minute rebuttal from the other candidate. And then there will be an opportunity for all of us to mix it up a little bit, to get into a discussion, and follow up. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the first hour. The first 60 minutes of this debate.

That will be followed by a 30-minute segment, during which we turn to the students here at the University of Delaware. They have questions.

Responses to their questions will be limited to one minute. Each candidate will also have two minutes at the end for a closing statement.

Our live audience here in Mitchell Hall understands, we hope, that there will be no applause during tonightÃ¢ÂÂs debate. We want everyone to be quiet and listen and learn from these two candidates.

A coin toss determined earlier the order for this evening. We begin with two-minute opening statements from each of the candidates, and we begin with Chris Coons.

CHRIS COONS, (D-DE) SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you. Thank you, President Harker.

To our moderators, Wolf Blitzer, Nancy Karibjanian, and to our hosts, UD Center for Political Communications and Delaware First Media.

ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a great deal at stake in this election for our state, for our families and for....

... our country. All of us, regardless of our political leanings, recognize that Washington is broken. As IÃ¢ÂÂve traveled up and down the state the last nine months as a candidate listening to voters talk about the issues facing them in their daily lives, IÃ¢ÂÂve heard again and again their frustration with Washington and with elected officials who are putting narrow partisan agendas ahead of the good of our country and doing little to help millions of Americans out of work or on the verge of losing their homes or who are anxious about their futures.

The partisan gridlock in Washington has real implications for us in Delaware. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs more than 35,000 Delawareans still out of work and nearly 3,000 families that have faced foreclosure this year. These arenÃ¢ÂÂt just numbers. In Delaware, these are our neighbors. And we canÃ¢ÂÂt simply stand by and watch Washington ignore us or them any longer.

In this election, DelawareÃ¢ÂÂs voters face a clear and important choice between, on the one hand, my opponent, a candidate who wants to take our state and candidate back to the failed economic policies of the past, who values partisan bickering over compromise and solutions. And who I believe has extreme positions that threaten vital education programs and would abandon our commitment to our veterans.

And on the other hand, in my case, a candidate with a proven track record of balancing budgets, finding bipartisan solutions, working with DelawareÃ¢ÂÂs businesses large and small, helping to create jobs and spur growth.

Over the next 90 minutes, I look forward to the chance to share with you my ideas and values, Delaware values that I learned growing up in Hokesen, working here in Newark with one of DelawareÃ¢ÂÂs most innovative manufacturing companies and leading DelawareÃ¢ÂÂs second largest government.

I take seriously the idea this campaign is a job interview. And tonightÃ¢ÂÂs debate is about giving DelawareÃ¢ÂÂs voters an insight into which candidate has the experience, the values, and the ideas to best represent them and do the hard work of fixing whatÃ¢ÂÂs broken in Washington.

Thank you.

KARIBJANIAN: Your opening statement.

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: Thank you.

Thank you to our hosts and for everyone being here tonight. IÃ¢ÂÂm running because IÃ¢ÂÂm concerned about the direction of our country. The America we knew and grew up with is being threatened in the most serious way. In just three years, we will be paying $1 billion a day on the interest alone on our national debt.

The common sense men and women in this room, and all across Delaware, know this is not sustainable. Yet my opponent wants to go to Washington and rubber-stamp the failed spending bills that are coming from -- that have cost us 2.5 million jobs.

This is wrong. Uncle Sam needs to be cut off.

With your vote and your support, I want to go to Washington to create jobs based on private business, not your tax dollars. I want to fight to have our nation become debt free. I want to stop the tax hikes that are coming in January. I want to reach sustainable energy independence, support the military, and strengthen the security of our homeland. I want to fight to safeguard Social Security, improve education, and protect our constitutional liberties.

And in an election year, when so much is at stake, just about every candidate says this, yet what distinguishes one candidate from another are the proposed solutions to reach these goals. I very much look forward to getting down to brass tacks with all of you over the next 90 minutes because I believe there is a clear choice in this election. A vote for my opponent will cost the average Delaware family $10,000 instantly between the January tax hikes and his vote for cap and trade.

Most of us canÃ¢ÂÂt afford that. If you think that government is too small and that your taxed too little, if youÃ¢ÂÂre ever questioned whether America is a beacon of freedom and justice, then heÃ¢ÂÂs your guy. But if you want a U.S. senator who will stand up to the Washington elite, who will put your interests ahead of the special interests, and make the tough decisions needed to rein in an out of control Washington, then I humbly ask you to vote OÃ¢ÂÂDonnell for U.S. Senate.

Thank you.

KARIBJANIAN: All right. WeÃ¢ÂÂre now getting into our question portion of the evening.

And IÃ¢ÂÂll begin with you, Mr. Coons. Creating jobs to get America back to work clearly has to be a priority to do. Americans voted overwhelmingly for Democrats during the last election, because most felt that the Democrats would be able to fix the failing economy. Unemployment is at 9.6%, almost three quarters of Americans in the most recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll said that the economy is still in a recession.

So why should the voters of Delaware trust a Democrat this time around?

COONS: Well, Nancy, thanks for your question. I think the voters of Delaware should trust this Democrat because of my combination of experience working in the private sector and working with the private sector. Hands-on work, helping one of DelawareÃ¢ÂÂs most innovative companies expand and grow jobs and concrete and engaged work working with our Chamber of Commerce, our business roundtable, the Committee of 100, lots of groups who represent businesses large and small to effectively grow the economy.

IÃ¢ÂÂve also presented as a candidate for the Senate concrete and real ideas.

TheyÃ¢ÂÂre on my web site but I look forward to the chance to go over them in some detail tonight.

I would advocate for a research and development tax credit and expand our tax credit thatÃ¢ÂÂs combined with a new manufacturing tax credit that advocates for companies that invent things here and make them here, getting an extra inventive.

I also think we need to change the crazy tax policy in Washington that gives an incentive to American companies to shut down operations here and ship jobs overseas.

ThereÃ¢ÂÂs other things IÃ¢ÂÂve proposed Ã¢ÂÂ expanding the home office tax credit, expanding a tax credit for starting a new business that employs folks within the first couple of years, fighting harder in trade policy to make sure weÃ¢ÂÂre not letting our trading partners take advantage of us in trade deals that were signed over previous years, doing more in investment and innovation.

At the end of the day, I think Delaware has a long tradition of inventing and manufacturing world class products. The best way for us to get out of this recession is through growth. The best way to growth is by taking advantage of the skills and resources of a world class university like this one where weÃ¢ÂÂre having this debate this evening and tying that to a stronger more qualified more capable workforce, giving it the resources and the energy it needs to be once again the leader in the world in creating high quality, high value manufacturing jobs.

Those are some of the ideas I look forward to discussing more this evening. Thank you.

KARIBJANIAN: Ms. OÃ¢ÂÂDonnell, you have one minute for a rebuttal.

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: Well, first, we have to keep in mind my opponent has a history of promising not to raise taxes on the campaign trail and then break those promises as soon as he takes office. Unemployment here in New Castle County rose, almost doubled in the last two years under his watch as New Castle county executive.

Now, when it comes to the policies that he has said on the campaign trail, he will continue to rubber-stamp the spending policies coming from Washington. We were promised that the stimulus bill would create jobs. But instead it cost us 2.6 million jobs. We were promised that it would keep unemployment at 8%, but instead we see unemployment at 9.7%.

The Democrats are bragging that unemployment has leveled out, but while unemployment has leveled out, more people than ever are on food stamps and our welfare spending is higher than ever. This is not the right move. This is not a move towards real economic recovery. This is a move towards creating a culture of dependency.

I believe the best thing the government...

KARIBJANIAN: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the time, sorry.

But now we get to open it to discussion.

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: Great.

BLITZER: Well, what specifically, Ms. OÃ¢ÂÂDonnell, would you do, specifically, to create jobs?

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: What I think the best thing the government can do to get our economy back on real economic recovery is for -- to get out of the way of the small business owner and get out of the way of the entrepreneur.

And the way you do that is to make sure these tax hikes donÃ¢ÂÂt come in January. You begin to roll back some of the regulation thatÃ¢ÂÂs forced them to close their doors.

A couple of that things IÃ¢ÂÂm proposing. And number one, a temporary two-year tax holiday on the capital gains tax to give investors the money they need to reinvest in business, to permanently eliminate the death tax. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not only an unjust bill because weÃ¢ÂÂve paid taxes while we saved it, but it will also create 1.5 million new jobs.

KARIBJANIAN: Let me just remind that we are in the discussion portion so you can interject here as well as we continue to discussion that point.

COONS: IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure I understand what Ms. OÃ¢ÂÂDonnell means when she says this is simply create ago culture of dependency and that her primary objective would be to end the endless regulation and red tape. She denounces the Obama administration, says its done nothing to promote job growth when frankly, just a few weeks ago, a new bill that would provide expanded SBA loan capacity, $30 billion worth of new lending capability, TARP funds that have been repaid, and are being repurchased towards small and midsized banks all over the United States. Real and concrete steps are being taken.

I also frankly canÃ¢ÂÂt imagine where she found the numbers that unemployment doubled in just the past year under my watch. I ssuspect weÃ¢ÂÂre going to need to keep a close eye this evening on the numbers that go flying back and forth.

BLITZER: LetÃ¢ÂÂs ask her, where did you get those numbers?

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: The Department of Labor statistics. And weÃ¢ÂÂll have them on our web site by tomorrow.

But I want to point out that he said that weÃ¢ÂÂre not creating a culture of dependency. How would you explain what is happening when unemployment is leveled out, but more and more people are on food stamps? WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to ask ourselves, what do we want Delawareans to be receiving, food stamps or paychecks? I say paychecks.

COONS: Obviously paychecks. WeÃ¢ÂÂd like to have Americans able to receive the benefits they need to get through incredibly difficult times. But to simply denounce people as being dependent because theyÃ¢ÂÂre applying for and receiving food stamps...

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: Oh, Chris, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not fair...

COONS: ...in the worst recession in modern times...

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not fair of you to say

COONS: Is frankly slandering people who are in incredibly difficult times.

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: That fair of you to say that, because thatÃ¢ÂÂs not at all what IÃ¢ÂÂm doing. IÃ¢ÂÂm not the person who would cut the tax benefits for disabled and low-income senior citizens, as you did as county executive.

But what IÃ¢ÂÂm proposing is to give these tax -- to make sure that the tax cults for our Delawareans do not expire this January. You have said that you will stop the tax cuts for the so-called rich. What you fail to realize is the so-called rich are the small business owner, the dry-cleaner down the street, the pizza shop owner who makes $300,000 before they pay their four employees, before they feed their own family...

BLITZER: IÃ¢ÂÂll have you respond.

COONS: Ms. OÃ¢ÂÂDonnell, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to try to have a conversation here this evening, rather than just a diatribe if we possibly could. I think it would be helpful to have an exchange of ideas and let each of us take turns so thank you for moderating, Wolf.

I think itÃ¢ÂÂs important to look closely at some of the things Ms.

OÃ¢ÂÂDonnellÃ¢ÂÂs thrown out on her new web site. Most of them are untrue.

Some of them are flat-out lies. Some of them are mischaracterizations.

Some are just factually untrue. So, IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to stop every single time thereÃ¢ÂÂs something she throws out that I disagree with or I think is factually untrue.

But let me just say at the outset, that much of what youÃ¢ÂÂve put out, much of how youÃ¢ÂÂve characterized my record is incorrect. And if we simply sit here and say, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not true, weÃ¢ÂÂre not going to make much progress.

BLITZER: Do you support keeping the Bush tax cuts for all Americans or only those make under $200,000 a year?

COONS: I suppose extending the Bush tax cuts for the overwhelming majority of Americans. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think we should draw an arbitrary line at $250,000. But the value that I will apply as deciding how much to extend, whether it goes up to $1 million or $2 million, or $5 millions that weÃ¢ÂÂve got a tough choice to make. Every increased tax cut, every extension thatÃ¢ÂÂs given, is going to cost, itÃ¢ÂÂs going to increase the deficit, it adds to the debt.

And hereÃ¢ÂÂs the primary value I would apply in deciding whether to extend all the Bush tax cuts and for how long. I think we should do those tax cuts that have the best chance of getting our economy going again...

BLITZER: All right...

KARIBJANIAN: WeÃ¢ÂÂre out of time though for this discussion.

BLITZER: But youÃ¢ÂÂre going to have an opportunity to get back into this discussion because this is issue number one Ã¢ÂÂ jobs, jobs, jobs. Also, the deficit. I want to get into the deficit right now. YouÃ¢ÂÂve made the point that the national debt is exploding, the budget deficit is exploding right now. I want some specific meaningful cuts, if youÃ¢ÂÂre elected a senator from Delaware, what would you cut in the federal budget? And donÃ¢ÂÂt just say waste, fraud and abuse, because everybody says that. What would you cut specifically?

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a great question because first of all we have got to tackle the deficit and the debt because our deficit is almost becoming equal to our national GDP. When your deficit -- a countryÃ¢ÂÂs deficit equals your GDP, thatÃ¢ÂÂs when your currency collapses, your market collapses. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to take drastic measures.

BLITZER: So what would you cut?

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: First of all, cancel the unspent stimulus bill. Second of all, put a freeze on non-discretionary -- on discretionary spending, put a hiring freeze on nonsecurity personnel. And then, of course, when weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about cutting government spending, weÃ¢ÂÂve got to talk about waste, fraud and abuse.

A recent report came out said we spend over $1 billion in Medicaid waste fraud and abuse. WeÃ¢ÂÂre talking about pharmacies billing for prescriptions given to dead people. WeÃ¢ÂÂre talking about home health care companies billing for patients who were in the hospital.

Senator Coburn recently put out a report called schoolhouse pork that disclosed millions of dollars that were supposed to go to education funding that instead went to special favors.

Now, special favors are something that my opponent knows very much about because he created 12 contingency funds so that he could pay out favors to special interest groups. The courts forced him to close 11 of them.

But of the one that remained open, he paid $53,000 in a menÃ¢ÂÂs fashion show. He paid another -- more than $50,000, to appease liberal special interest groups.

At a time when he brags about balancing the budget by raising our taxes, cutting policemen pay, this is how he chooses to spend our tax dollars.

WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to ask, do we want to send this gentleman to Washington, D.C.?

I would say no.

HeÃ¢ÂÂs a career politician who has proven he knows how to play the IÃ¢ÂÂll scratch your back, you scratch mine game.

BLITZER: You have a minute to respond.

COONS: ThereÃ¢ÂÂs so much to respond to Wolf, a minute may not be enough.

Let me get back to the focus of the question, is what would you do to tackle the deficit and the debt? I think we have some very large challenges in front of us. The overwhelming majority of federal spending is made up by defense spending, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and interest on the debt.

While the president has proposed, and I would seriously consider supporting, a freeze on non defense discretionary spending for three years, which would achieve significant reductions. IÃ¢ÂÂve also identified on my web site a series of reductions that I would support. Some of them are in agricultural price supports. Some are in federal office space, for example, or hiring. And several are in defense programs.

Defense acquisition that the Pentagon itself has already said they no longer need. The C-17 program for example, or the second engine for the F-35. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a variety of platforms and programs that I think we can simply do away with. As we invest in making our defense and our military more modern, more flexible, more responsive to the real threats we face in the modern world. And as we continue to achieve some savings through the BRAC program and other things that have shown a real capacity to save.

KARIBJANIAN: LetÃ¢ÂÂs open the discussion on correcting some of the financial issues here by talk about some of your own personal financial problems. And most people know about it by now, including an IRS lien that was for about $12,000 in taxes and penalties from Ã¢ÂÂ05. There was the Ã¢ÂÂ08 mortgage default judgment on your home. You just received your bachelors degree, as you said, because it took a decade to pay of the tuition.

The question, then is, how can voters rely upon your thoughts on how to manage the deficit if youÃ¢ÂÂre having such personal financial issues of your own?

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: Well, first of all, that IRS tax lien, the IRS already admitted that it was a computer error and my opponent should not be bringing that up, because as IÃ¢ÂÂve gone up and down the campaign trail, IÃ¢ÂÂve discovered there are thousands of Delawareans who have faced the same thing. An IRS mistake has caused them greatly, which is all the more reason why we need to reform the IRS, not put them in control of our health care.

Second of all, you mentioned education. I donÃ¢ÂÂt have a trust fund. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt come from a privileged, sheltered background as my opponent says he did...

KARIBJANIAN:: LetÃ¢ÂÂs stay to the issue of paying bills...

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: I am. I paid for my own college education. I also have a graduate fellowship in constitutional government from the Claremont Institute. I know how hard it is to earn and keep a dollar. And one of the reasons why the Delawareans should be able to trust me is because when I did in this economy, I worked for nonprofit groups. Nonprofit groups were the first to have been hurt. When I fell upon difficult times, I made the sacrifices needed to set things right. I sold my house. And I sold a lot of my possessions in order to pay of my personal debt and to become in a stronger position.

I have worked hard in order to get to the position that I am. So I can relate to the thousands of Delaware families that are suffering right now. And IÃ¢ÂÂm stronger for it. I made it through to the other side. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs where -- leadership doesnÃ¢ÂÂt count in whether or not you fall, it counts in whether or not youÃ¢ÂÂve gotten up and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what IÃ¢ÂÂve done.

KARIBJANIAN: LetÃ¢ÂÂs just remember weÃ¢ÂÂre in the discussion portion so if you have anything you want to address on things that have been said on this topic thus far, go for it.

COONS: Well Nancy, I frankly think that we need to focus in this debate this evening and in the campaign, not on personal financial difficulties or background earns but on the issues in front of us, the things that Delawareans are concerned about Ã¢ÂÂ how do we tackle the deficit and debt, how do we get Delaware back to work?

ThereÃ¢ÂÂs been lots of discussion in the national media about things my opponent has said or done that I frankly think are a distraction from the core issues that Delawareans ask about Ã¢ÂÂ ask both of us about.

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: YouÃ¢ÂÂre just jealous that you werenÃ¢ÂÂt Ã¢ÂÂ

COONS: What would you do in Washington?

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: -- on Ã¢ÂÂSaturday Night Live.Ã¢ÂÂ

COONS: IÃ¢ÂÂm Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂm dying to see whoÃ¢ÂÂs going to play me, Christine.

BLITZER: Well, letÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ on a serious note, letÃ¢ÂÂs get through some of the accusations that sheÃ¢ÂÂd made and Ã¢ÂÂ and weÃ¢ÂÂll give you a chance to respond.

COONS: Please.

BLITZER: That Ã¢ÂÂ

COONS: On the idea that somehow I was the one responsible for being sued for creating 11, 12 Ã¢ÂÂ sheÃ¢ÂÂs confusing me with my predecessor, Tom Gordon.

BLITZER: What weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about is County Executive Ã¢ÂÂ

COONS: Yes.

BLITZER: -- New Castle County Executive. You raised property taxes, according to reports, three times, 25 percent hike in the last fiscal year. You proposed new taxes on hotels, paramedic services, even 911 calls from cell phones. Is that true?

COONS: No. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not true that we proposed a tax on the calls to the 911 center. In any case Ã¢ÂÂ

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNEL: ItÃ¢ÂÂs not true.

COONS: -- research into that would reveal that. ItÃ¢ÂÂs difficult, itÃ¢ÂÂs complicated, but IÃ¢ÂÂll take Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂll take a Ã¢ÂÂ

BLITZER: Well, explain your record on Ã¢ÂÂ on taxes. Did you increase taxes as the county executive?

COONS: Wolf, let me walk you through, for a moment, whatÃ¢ÂÂs happened, because one of the attacks my opponentÃ¢ÂÂs made repeatedly is that IÃ¢ÂÂve driven the county to the edge of bankruptcy. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs on her newest attack. Nothing could be the further from the truth.

Today, New Castle County has a surplus. When I became executive in Ã¢ÂÂ05, it had a deficit. I have worked hard over six years to defend a very significant reserve, which has made it possible for us to continue to have a Triple-A bond rating. Out of 3,000 Ã¢ÂÂ roughly 3,000 counties in America, roughly 30 have a Triple-A bond rating, and I reached a bipartisan solution Ã¢ÂÂ

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNEL: It says stop.

COONS: -- that cut more in spending than was raised in taxes.

BLITZER: All right, a quick response and then weÃ¢ÂÂll move to the next Ã¢ÂÂ

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: YouÃ¢ÂÂve been criticized for saying that you brought the county to Triple A bond rating. You inherited that good rating. And how would you justify cutting the tax exception for low income seniors and disabled seniors, cutting our policeman pay when you wastefully spent so much money on appeasing the special interest groups?

You simply canÃ¢ÂÂt justify that. That is a career politician. That is cronyism. We donÃ¢ÂÂt need any more of that in Washington.

BLITZER: Very quickly, because we got to move to the next series of questions, do you want to respond to that?

COONS: ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot to respond to in that.

BLITZER: Do it in 30 seconds.

COONS: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be difficult, Wolf.

But IÃ¢ÂÂll tell you that IÃ¢ÂÂm proud of my record as New Castle County Executive. The very hard choices that had to be made to clean up the government Ã¢ÂÂ every time you get a bond rating, you earned a bond rating.

Ms. OÃ¢ÂÂDonnellÃ¢ÂÂs not familiar with how bond ratings work. Each time you go to the bond market, you are re-rated. MoodyÃ¢ÂÂs, in their letter of rating just two weeks ago, said that it was because of the conservative fiscal policies of my administration that we have re-earned a Triple A bond rating from all three agencies.

BLITZER: All right. LetÃ¢ÂÂs move on to the next series of questions on national security, foreign policy, right now. A hundred thousand American men and women are serving in the military in Afghanistan right now. The president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, has now acknowledged heÃ¢ÂÂs in direct talks with the Taliban leadership, wants to create what he calls a peace council.

HereÃ¢ÂÂs the question, and it goes to Mr. Coons. Would you support a negotiated settlement in Afghanistan that includes Taliban representation? Would that be acceptable to you, a deal between Hamid Karzai and the Taliban?

COONS: Wolf, IÃ¢ÂÂm concerned about the security of our troops in the field and about honoring the service and the sacrifice of our veterans. The war in Afghanistan is the war of the two that weÃ¢ÂÂve been engaged in, Iraq and Afghanistan, that I think was justified by a direct attack on the United States by the Taliban, who were offering harbor to al Qaeda, who were the authors of the 9/11 attack.

And I think in our 10th year now, on the ground in Afghanistan, we have to look hard at whether weÃ¢ÂÂre continuing to contribute to AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs security by having 100,000 troops on the ground. I would support a negotiated resolution to the war that allowed us leave security and intelligence assets in place and that allowed us the opportunity to reengage, should the Taliban take control again, or allow al Qaeda to reemerge as a real threat to the region or to the United States.

WeÃ¢ÂÂve spent $1.3 trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has significantly contributed to our debt. We have lost more than 5,000 American servicemen and women, and IÃ¢ÂÂve got folks who I am personally close to who are deployed now for the third or fourth tour.

We have asked a lot of our men and women in the field. They have delivered brilliantly. But, frankly, the mission has exceeded the scope that I think we could initially reasonably expect of them.

I am far more concerned about the threats to our security posed by an unstable Pakistan, posed by Iran, and posed by an endless war in a country where weÃ¢ÂÂre trying to build a nation where there really hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been one in modern times.

BLITZER: You have one minute to respond.

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: Well, I would ask him, if heÃ¢ÂÂs serious about making sure that Afghanistan doesnÃ¢ÂÂt become a safe haven for terrorists, why, on the campaign trail, he has said that he supports this random time withdrawal?

We have to support our men and women who are risking their lives. Many of them have already given their lives over there. A random withdrawal that he has said he support will simply embolden the terrorists to come out after us even more, saying IÃ¢ÂÂve chased away the super power.

When we withdraw from Iraq, we need to make sure that there are benchmarks in place. Those benchmarks are making sure that thereÃ¢ÂÂs a government that Ã¢ÂÂ a representative government over there that serves the needs of the people and that can defend themselves. When weÃ¢ÂÂve reached these benchmarks, thatÃ¢ÂÂs when we withdraw.

BLITZER: You want to respond to that?

COONS: She said withdraw from Iraq. I suspect you meant withdraw from Afghanistan.

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: No. From Afghanistan. Did I say Iraq? IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry.

Thank you, Chris. YouÃ¢ÂÂre correct. I meant Afghanistan.

COONS: If weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about Afghanistan Ã¢ÂÂ

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: Yes. Thank you.

COONS: -- and, you know, frankly, I come from a family of veterans. I come from a family that has dedicated a lot to the service of our nation, and I wear a flag pin every day to remain me of the young man who grew up next door to me, who was killed in Iraq in December of 2005.

I never take lightly the enormous sacrifices that our servicemen and women have made now, and that we ask them to continue making. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know how long is too long, but 10 years strikes me as awfully long. And I question whether your standard, whether your principles, give us any hope of winding up this war on any reasonable timeline, because, frankly, the government of Hamid Karzai has proven itself to be largely corrupt, and to be frankly ineffective at establishing control over the whole country.

We are doing our best. We have dedicated trillions, hundreds of billions of dollars to this conflict, and IÃ¢ÂÂm frankly deeply concerned that itÃ¢ÂÂs a conflict without a reasonable end in sight.

There are times in history Ã¢ÂÂ

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: Saying that youÃ¢ÂÂre Ã¢ÂÂ

COONS: -- the best way to honor the sacrifice of servicemen and women is to come up with a plan to responsibly wind down a conflict.

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: And that plan should be based on those benchmarks, the benchmarks that means that we have had success.

Again, youÃ¢ÂÂre saying hallow rhetoric, when you Ã¢ÂÂ you say that your top priority is the concern for the safety of us on the homeland if you seriously support this random time withdrawal. Because, again, all weÃ¢ÂÂre going to do is embolden the terrorists to think that they have more power than they do.

And I would ask you, you know, a couple of times, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs the tax cuts or even here in this kind of veiled Ã¢ÂÂ youÃ¢ÂÂve gone back and forth on what you just said in Afghanistan. Do you support the president or donÃ¢ÂÂt you support the president? With the tax cuts youÃ¢ÂÂre saying that you donÃ¢ÂÂt support the president.

COONS: Ms. OÃ¢ÂÂDonnell, letÃ¢ÂÂs stay focused Ã¢ÂÂ

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: Are you going to tell him that when he comes on Friday?

COONS: -- letÃ¢ÂÂs stay focused on the issue in front of us, which is Afghanistan. YouÃ¢ÂÂve suggested gauzy benchmarks Ã¢ÂÂ

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: And itÃ¢ÂÂs you Ã¢ÂÂ youÃ¢ÂÂre jumping around.

COONS: No, weÃ¢ÂÂre staying focused on the issue of Afghanistan rather than jumping to other issues.

OÃ¢ÂÂDONNELL: And you jumped around. You said that security Ã¢ÂÂ

COONS: Ms. OÃ¢ÂÂDonnell Ã¢ÂÂ

171	"The U.S. Internal Revenue code may make War and Peace read like a novella.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs how onerous and confounding the nationÃ¢ÂÂs tax code is, according to Rep. Leonard Lance (R-7th), who issued a news release April 15 calling for ""meaningful tax reform"" and blasting the complexity of the tax code.

""The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news,"" Lance said in the news release.

But not all the news is bad for Lance.

LetÃ¢ÂÂs first review the size of the tax code and then compare that with the size of the Bible.

A 2010 report by the Internal Revenue ServiceÃ¢ÂÂs TaxpayerÃ¢ÂÂs Advocate Office found that the tax code contained 3.8 million words. That calculation was made by downloading a zipped file of the code, unzipping it and running it through Microsoft WordÃ¢ÂÂs word-count feature, according to a footnote in the report. A 2012 version of the report puts the number of words in the code at Ã¢ÂÂabout 4 million.Ã¢ÂÂ

We also reached out to CCH, the Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of the two-volume 2013 Winter version of the tax code and was told the best estimate of word length was 4 million. CCH is a Wolters Kluwer business.

So LanceÃ¢ÂÂs claim about the number of words is generally accurate.

Next, letÃ¢ÂÂs look at number of pages. Lance said 5,600, based on the same figure cited by articles in the Washington Post, the Harvard Business Review and other publications, according to Todd Mitchell, LanceÃ¢ÂÂs chief of staff.

Mark Luscombe, a principal federal tax analyst for CCH, said the publisherÃ¢ÂÂs version of the tax code is 5,036 pages.

""Private publishers do a print version of the Internal Revenue code, but then youÃ¢ÂÂre looking at one private publisherÃ¢ÂÂs version of the code,"" he said. ""We do it in two volumes and we keep condensing it.""

The key point here? Letter size, font and spacing matter when counting pages in the tax code and even in the Bible.

Dennis Olson, the Charles T. Haley professor of Old Testament Theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary said an approximation of 800,000 words for the Old and New testaments combined is fair.

""The King James Version would be 823,156 while the more recent New Revised Standard Version would be 774,746 words,"" Olson said in an e-mail.

Hellen Mardaga, an assistant professor of New Testament at Catholic University in Washington, said thereÃ¢ÂÂs no standard way to measure the size of the Bible, given its numerous translations and texts but said she, too, was aware of estimates that put the Bible at 800,000 words.

Mardaga also noted that dividing 4 million Ã¢ÂÂ the number of words in the tax code Ã¢ÂÂ by 800,000 - would mean the tax code is five times longer than the Bible -- not LanceÃ¢ÂÂs seven.

We looked at versions of the King James and New American Standard versions of the Bible on Amazon.com, an online retailer of books and other merchandise. The four Bibles we looked at ranged in size from 512 pages to 1,112. Accordingly, Mitchell said he has seen numerous references comparing the size of the tax code with the Bible, ranging from 4 times as long to 10 times as long. Seven, he said, is in the middle.

""It all depends on what version (of the Bible) you have in front of you,"" he said. ""IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure thereÃ¢ÂÂs a right or wrong answer to the question.""

Our ruling

Lance said, ""The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news.""

ItÃ¢ÂÂs generally accepted that the code is about 4 million words in length, according to previous published reports and the publisher of the 2013 winter version of the tax code. Lance also based his figure of 5,600 pages on previous reports from publications such as the Harvard Business Review. Opinions also differ on the codeÃ¢ÂÂs length when compared with the Bible, given the many versions, translations and texts of it. And while the tax code isnÃ¢ÂÂt seven times as long as the Bible, even given a standard word count for the good book, we get LanceÃ¢ÂÂs overall point: the tax code is long and complex. We rate his claim Mostly True.

172	"Ã¢ÂÂ -- Though he touts his outstanding memory, when Donald Trump was asked under oath about his dealings with a twice-convicted Russian ÃÂ©migrÃÂ© who served prison time and had documented mafia connections, the real estate mogul was at a loss.

Even though the man, Felix Sater, had played a role in a number of high-profile Trump-branded projects across the country.

Ã¢ÂÂIf he were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn't know what he looked like,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump testified in a video deposition for a civil lawsuit two years ago.

In recent weeks, the Republican Presidential candidate has been fending off critics who have accused him of embellishment, insensitivity and in some cases inaccuracy for his descriptions of the Muslim response to 9/11. Trump also dismissed outrage at his purported mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter, saying he simply does not remember meeting the scribe.

Away from the spotlight, Donald Trump has also been seeking to minimize his past business ties with Sater, the Russian ÃÂ©migrÃÂ© who appeared in photos with Trump, and carried a Trump Organization business card with the title Ã¢ÂÂSenior Advisor to Donald Trump.Ã¢ÂÂ

Asked last week about Sater by The Associated Press, Trump again seemed unable to retrieve a solid memory of the man. ""Felix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it,"" he told the reporter. ""I'm not that familiar with him.""

Trump and Sater can be seen together in photographs attending a Denver business conference in 2005, and the two men posed on stage together at the 2007 launch party for the Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium project. And in 2010, according to TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs lawyer, Sater was provided business cards by the Trump Organization identifying him as a Ã¢ÂÂsenior advisor"" to Trump.

Sater has declined repeated requests for an interview, citing the advice of his attorney. But he has not been shy about posting items online touting his ties to Trump. On his website, he called the Trump SoHo his Ã¢ÂÂmost prized project.Ã¢ÂÂ For years he identified himself on his online resume at the LinkedIn website as having been a ""senior advisor"" to Trump in 2010-2011. Last month, after ABC News asked TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs attorney about it, that portion of SaterÃ¢ÂÂs online resume was deleted.

The Ã¢ÂÂsenior advisorÃ¢ÂÂ title stands in sharp contrast to how Trump and his aides have repeatedly described the nature of their connection with Sater, including in response to questions from ABC News.

Alan Garten, TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs General Counsel, initially told ABC News that Trump Ã¢ÂÂhad no real direct relationship with Felix SaterÃ¢ÂÂ and that Sater was not an advisor to Donald Trump Ã¢ÂÂin my mind, and not in anyone at the Trump Organization's mind.Ã¢ÂÂ

A few days later, Garten confirmed the authenticity of SaterÃ¢ÂÂs Trump business card with the Ã¢ÂÂsenior advisorÃ¢ÂÂ title which included a Trump Organization email address and phone number. But the lawyer said the title was not reflective of SaterÃ¢ÂÂs actual role. It was common practice in the real estate industry, he said, to provide business cards and bestow titles Ã¢ÂÂin order for brokers to be able to make initial introductions.Ã¢ÂÂ

Donald Trump exits the Budweiser Events Center after talking at the Bixpo 2005 convention in Loveland, Colo., Sept. 14, 2005. Felix Sater appears in the red tie on Trump's left.

Garten said Sater was Ã¢ÂÂnever employed by or on the payroll of the Trump organizationÃ¢ÂÂ and that Ã¢ÂÂno deals ever came from those activitiesÃ¢ÂÂ in 2010. But Garten declined to respond to emails and phone messages with further questions, including whether Sater was provided office space or compensated by the Trump organization in any other way. Images of SaterÃ¢ÂÂs business card were wiped from the internet shortly after ABC News asked Garten about it.

TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs extensive business relationships are garnering fresh attention as the public is becoming better acquainted with the real estate mogul-turned-politician who has catapulted into front-runner territory in the race for the GOP presidential nomination.

The cast of characters who participated in TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs many development deals touch on a topic the candidate regularly cites on the campaign trail -- his judgment at the helm of his real estate empire. Trump says his Ã¢ÂÂtremendousÃ¢ÂÂ record of success is one of his most important qualifications to become President of the United States.

The connection to Felix Sater dates to the early 2000's when the Trump Organization worked on several occasions with a small development firm based in Trump Tower called the Bayrock Group, where Sater was an executive until 2007.

As Trump explained it during a 2013 deposition, the relationship began when Bayrock was a tenant in his Trump Tower office building, when Ã¢ÂÂsomebody from Bayrock, I'm not exactly sure, came to see -- either myself or one of my childrenÃ¢ÂÂ with a proposal for a development deal. Ã¢ÂÂIt could have been Felix Sater, it could have been -- I really don't know who it might have been,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump said, Ã¢ÂÂbut somebody from Bayrock.Ã¢ÂÂ

Donald Trump is deposed under oath during a civil lawsuit in November 2013.

Sater had already served prison time for a grisly 1991 assault at the El Rio Grande restaurant and bar in New York. According to court documents, Sater allegedly told a man at the bar, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂll kill you. IÃ¢ÂÂll rip your f****** head off and stick it down your throat.Ã¢ÂÂ Sater then allegedly grabbed a frozen margarita from the bar, flung the contents in the air, smashed the glass on the bar, and stabbed the man in the cheek and neck, breaking his cheek and jaw, lacerating face and neck and severing nerves. He was convicted of first degree assault.

As he began his work with Bayrock, Sater was also awaiting sentencing for his role in what authorities called a $40 million Ã¢ÂÂpump and dumpÃ¢ÂÂ stock scam. Federal prosecutors announced in a March 2, 2000 press release that Sater had pleaded guilty in the federal racketeering case, and was found to have been collaborating with members of four New York mob families. Sater and others had Ã¢ÂÂplanned and carried out a series of fraudulent securities schemes and then laundered tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits,Ã¢ÂÂ the release said.

Prosecutors said Sater and others had Ã¢ÂÂenlisted the help of individuals affiliated with organized crimes families of La Cosa Nostra to protect and promote their criminal activities.Ã¢ÂÂ

Sater avoided prison after FBI agents testified at his sentencing hearing that he had become an important government witness on both mob-related and national security matters, heralded by federal agents for his cooperation. His lawyer, Robert Wolf, told the Associated Press that some of the information about Sater in public records and lawsuits is defamatory. Wolf told the AP that credits Sater's stint as a government cooperator with potentially saving American military lives, although he did not provide details. Wolf told the AP to write about Sater's past ""at your own risk"" but did not cite specific concerns.

During this period, SaterÃ¢ÂÂs role at Bayrock was not clearly defined. He at various times appeared in company emails and other records as the Ã¢ÂÂchief operating officerÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂmanaging director.Ã¢ÂÂ In a 2010 deposition Sater said titles at the firm varied. Ã¢ÂÂI was probably number two man in the company,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂThe actual position, I don't remember what it was.Ã¢ÂÂ

While the Trump SoHo project was considered a success, four other Bayrock projects were either never built or were finished by others. Some of them resulted in lawsuits from unhappy investors. In each case, Trump was not the actual developer of the project and was, instead, paid a fee to license the use of his name and potentially operate the hotel projects.

During this period, Trump and Bayrock also collaborated on a proposal for the 600,000-square-foot Trump International Hotel and Residences, Phoenix, that was to include a spa, swimming pools, Ã¢ÂÂexquisite gardens,Ã¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂa world-class celebrity chef restaurant.Ã¢ÂÂ

The project never got off the ground, however, and in a 2007 lawsuit filed in state court against Ã¢ÂÂthe Trump/Bayrock Organization,Ã¢ÂÂ the plaintiff alleged that Sater threatened one of the Arizona partners in the deal, a man named Earnest Mennes. Sater was alleged to have told Mennes he would call in a relative to Ã¢ÂÂelectrically shock Mr. Mennes' testicles, cut off Mr. Mennes' legs, and leave Mr. Mennes dead in the trunk of his car.Ã¢ÂÂ

SaterÃ¢ÂÂs lawyer calls the allegation Ã¢ÂÂan outright fabricationÃ¢ÂÂ made as part of a lawsuit demanding a financial settlement.

Reached in Arizona, Mennes said the matter had been settled out of court and he could not discuss it. Mennes said he reflects proudly on the time he worked on the Trump project, and considers Trump a masterful businessman. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs lawyer said he was unaware of the allegations in the Arizona lawsuit.

TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs attorney says the real estate mogul had minimal interaction with Sater on the various joint ventures with Bayrock, and so had no reason to probe deeply into his background.

Ã¢ÂÂTo be clear,Ã¢ÂÂ Garten told ABC News, Ã¢ÂÂMr. Sater's involvement in the projects, the projects that went forward, SoHo and Fort Lauderdale, may have existed in the beginning, but long term there was very little involvement.Ã¢ÂÂ

Sater's alleged ties to organized crime were more widely publicized in December 2007 when The New York Times published an article featuring SaterÃ¢ÂÂs ties to Trump and describing his Ã¢ÂÂtangled past.Ã¢ÂÂ The article reported that Sater Ã¢ÂÂhad been an Ã¢ÂÂunindicted co-conspiratorÃ¢ÂÂ and a key figure in a $40 million scheme involving 19 stockbrokers and organized crime figures from four Mafia families.Ã¢ÂÂ

Sater told the Times that activity was in the past. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm trying to lead an exemplary existence,Ã¢ÂÂ he said then. Ã¢ÂÂOld, bad luggage is not something anyone wants to remember.Ã¢ÂÂ

While SaterÃ¢ÂÂs criminal conviction had been publicized, much of his role in the racketeering case had until that point been kept secret -- sealed by the government because Sater had become a Ã¢ÂÂcooperatorÃ¢ÂÂ on a range of matters.

SaterÃ¢ÂÂs attorney provided ABC News with a copy of a public statement from Attorney General Loretta Lynch, whose New York office had enlisted cooperation from Sater when she was serving as a U.S. Attorney.

Ã¢ÂÂThe defendant in question, Felix Sater, provided valuable and sensitive information to the government during the course of his cooperation,Ã¢ÂÂ her statement said. He provided information Ã¢ÂÂcrucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and members of La Cosa Nostra.Ã¢ÂÂ

Garten said Trump read the 2007 Times report and was Ã¢ÂÂsurprised.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂHe had no idea,Ã¢ÂÂ Garten said. It Ã¢ÂÂwas the first time that both the Trump organization and Bayrock learned of Mr. Sater's background.Ã¢ÂÂ

Garten added, Ã¢ÂÂWhen you go into business with another company, you're going to vet that company certainly, but you're not going to vet every employee, itÃ¢ÂÂs just not appropriate.""

Once that information became publicly known, Garten initially told ABC News, Trump Ã¢ÂÂcut all tiesÃ¢ÂÂ with Sater. But, Garten then acknowledged, the Trump organization continued to listen to deals pitched by Sater well after that.

Asked why Trump would listen to a deal brought by a twice-convicted felon with alleged mafia ties, Garten told ABC News, Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre going to look at the deal, youÃ¢ÂÂre not going to look at the broker.Ã¢ÂÂ

During his 2013 deposition, when asked about how much he knew about SaterÃ¢ÂÂs past, Trump said he knew Sater had Ã¢ÂÂgot into trouble because he got into a barroom fight which a lot of people do.Ã¢ÂÂ And, he added, Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt know him very well, but I donÃ¢ÂÂt think he was connected to the mafia.Ã¢ÂÂ

In 2013, the BBC pressed Trump asking why he didnÃ¢ÂÂt say Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre fired!Ã¢ÂÂ to Sater after reports surfaced alleging Sater had ties to organized crime, Trump ultimately rose from his chair mid-interview.

Ã¢ÂÂI hate to do this, but I do have that big group of people waiting so I have to leave,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, walking out of the room.

Trump said during the deposition four months later he could not recall doing the BBC interview.

In August, the Washington Examiner asked Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, about the mogulÃ¢ÂÂs past dealings with Sater. ""I have no idea who Felix Sater is, he has nothing to do with the Donald J. Trump for President presidential campaign,"" Lewandowski replied. ""I've never heard of the guy.Ã¢ÂÂ

For investors who put money into those Trump-branded projects based on the reputation of the man behind the name brand, news that one of the people involved, Sater, had such a checkered criminal history was distressing.

Cathy Cather, a Fort Lauderdale healthcare consultant, invested and lost money in the Trump condominium hotel project in her hometown Ã¢ÂÂ which failed in part because of the economic collapse. She told ABC News she made her decision in part based on glossy brochures emblazoned with TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs photos and such slogans as ""There is luxury... And then there is THE TRUMP EXPERIENCE.""

Ã¢ÂÂI invested because it was Trump,Ã¢ÂÂ Cather told ABC News.

The state has tried selling its unwanted jet online four times and failed. So last week, the Palin administration signed a contract with an Anchorage aircraft broker who thinks he can succeed where eBay couldn't The eBay thing didn't work out very well, said Dan Spencer, director of administrative services for the Department of Public Safety. He's the person charged with trying to get rid of the infamous Westwind II.

The administration made a deal last week with Turbo North Aviation, promising the broker a 1.49 percent cut of the selling price.

Former Gov. Frank Murkowski bought the jet, which cost the state about $2.6 million, over the protests of the Legislature and used it to fly around the state, sometimes mixing campaign errands with government business.

After he defied almost everyone to acquire it, the jet became a political albatross for Murkowski. Gov. Sarah Palin beat Murkowski bad in last August's Republican primary. One of her campaign promises was to sell the plane and she's been trying to unload it for months. Robert Heckmann owns Turbo North Aviation. He said his company has sold more than 1,800 planes including two dozen or so jets in the past 27 years.

Spencer said Heckmann suggested the asking price of $2,450,000, based on the current jet market.

The state's definitely not going to give this plane away. If that was the case, then they would have sold it on eBay Heckmann said. He described prospective buyers a governments, corporate entities, oil companies, movie stars, well-to-do people.

Meanwhile, the state is stuck making quarterly payments of about $62,000 on the Westwind II. So is the state sick of dealing with this bird?

I don't know about anyone else Spencer said. You don't want to keep making payments on something you're not using, he said. l'll be happy when it sells. I'll be a happy guy."	0
174	"We will do everything we can to make it enforceable, which it is not now. We will stop the kind of constant sniping at our protections for our workers that can come from foreign companies because they have the authority to try to sue to overturn what we do to keep our workers safe.

This is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements.

MR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.

Before we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama.

SEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal.

Now, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating.

And as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas. We have to stop providing tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States of America."	0
175	"Impeachment talk becomes a cynical game

On Friday, a top White House aide said it was possible Republicans could impeach President Obama if he decided to take executive action on immigration. Days later, on Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner fired back at this impeachment chatter: Ã¢ÂÂListen, itÃ¢ÂÂs all a scam started by Democrats at the White House.Ã¢ÂÂ But letÃ¢ÂÂs be honest here: Both sides -- Democrats and Republicans -- believe the impeachment talk is good for motivating their base. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says itÃ¢ÂÂs raked in more than $3 million in online donations since Thursday with solicitations like this one from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Ã¢ÂÂBoehner is planning a vote to sue the president. The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting President in all of U.S. history. And if they do it, impeachment may very well be the next stepÃ¢ÂÂ). Democrats also hope the impeachment talk can force a replay of 1998, when the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton backfired against the GOP that midterm season. As for Boehner and House Republicans, theyÃ¢ÂÂre being disingenuous, too. The GOP base loves the impeachment talk (see Sarah Palin, Allen West, Drudge, and the rhetoric from some sitting House members). Indeed, BoehnerÃ¢ÂÂs lawsuit seems intended to tap into that conservative impeachment enthusiasm -- but without going all the way to impeachment. ItÃ¢ÂÂs impeachment-lite. The House will vote tonight on that lawsuit against the president, per NBCÃ¢ÂÂs Frank Thorp.

And itÃ¢ÂÂs beneath the White House and the speaker

So both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the countryÃ¢ÂÂs problems. (Republicans: Ã¢ÂÂThis President is breaking the law!Ã¢ÂÂ Democrats: Ã¢ÂÂThey want to impeach the president!Ã¢ÂÂ) And whatÃ¢ÂÂs particularly jarring is that this isnÃ¢ÂÂt taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. ItÃ¢ÂÂs beneath the White House, and itÃ¢ÂÂs beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties arenÃ¢ÂÂt taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks.

A Tale of Two Bills

Despite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming AmericanÃ¢ÂÂs embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So thatÃ¢ÂÂs on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldnÃ¢ÂÂt afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesnÃ¢ÂÂt). In the case of the border, there just isnÃ¢ÂÂt a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties.

House GOP Ã¢ÂÂcautiously optimisticÃ¢ÂÂ about ability to get 218 votes for border bill

As for the House GOPÃ¢ÂÂs $659 million border bill, NBCÃ¢ÂÂs Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are Ã¢ÂÂcautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a Ã¢ÂÂbrick wallÃ¢ÂÂ in the House.Ã¢ÂÂ Then again, itÃ¢ÂÂs truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014.

Latest on the Highway Trust Fund standoff

Meanwhile, hereÃ¢ÂÂs the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: Ã¢ÂÂThe Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back,Ã¢ÂÂ Roll Call reports. Ã¢ÂÂAfter the SenateÃ¢ÂÂs version of the bill passed 79 to 18 Ã¢ÂÂ Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a Ã¢ÂÂfree voteÃ¢ÂÂ¦because the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out Ã¢ÂÂ after theyÃ¢ÂÂve leftÃ¢ÂÂ for the August recess.Ã¢ÂÂ So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund Ã¢ÂÂcliffÃ¢ÂÂ of sorts, the threat is back. And this is Senate vs. House stuff -- not necessarily, GOP vs Dem business.

Economy grew by 4% in 2nd quarter

More good economic news: Ã¢ÂÂAfter a dismal winter, the U.S. economy sprang back to life in the April-June quarter, growing at a fast 4 percent annual rate on the strength of higher consumer and business spending,Ã¢ÂÂ the AP says. Ã¢ÂÂThe Commerce Department says the second-quarter rebound followed a sharp 2.1 percent annualized drop in economic activity in the January-March quarter. That figure was revised up from a previous estimate of a 2.9 percent decline.Ã¢ÂÂ

Tom SteyerÃ¢ÂÂs TV campaign begins -- against Joni Ernst in Iowa

The millions of dollars in TV ads that liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer plans to spend in the midterms is beginning -- with the release of NextGen ClimateÃ¢ÂÂs multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. This new TV ad charges that Ernst is tied to Republican special interests. NextGen Climate says this is the first of a series in ads hitting Ernst, and itÃ¢ÂÂs a $2.6 million buy over five weeks in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and the Quad Cities markets. A little background on SteyerÃ¢ÂÂs involvement this midterm cycle: A Super PAC funded by Democratic environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer has announced it will spend as much as $100 million this election season attacking Republicans in seven key states who it says are climate-science Ã¢ÂÂdeniers,Ã¢ÂÂ elevating the issue of climate change in these contests. SteyerÃ¢ÂÂs group, NextGen Climate, says it will target Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Paul LePage of Maine and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, as well as GOP Senate candidates Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan and Scott Brown in New Hampshire.

Poll: Kasich still leading in Ohio

A new Quinnipiac poll finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in OhioÃ¢ÂÂs gubernatorial race, 48%-36%. Of all the 2010 GOP victors, itÃ¢ÂÂs mildly surprising that Kasich now among safer of these incumbents sitting in a swing state. HeÃ¢ÂÂs still not out of the woods, but heÃ¢ÂÂs stronger today than any strategist in either party would have thought two years ago.

Dueling coal ads in West Virginia

Days after Natalie Tennant (D) released a new TV ad in West VirginiaÃ¢ÂÂs Senate race hitting her partyÃ¢ÂÂs own president on coal, Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito is out with her own TV ad on coal -- and trying to one up Tennant. Capito responded immediately, and doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem to be taking any chances here

The bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trial

If you followed former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnellÃ¢ÂÂs rise and fall -- like we have over the past five years -- this was a stunning story. And talk about a twist: Ã¢ÂÂLawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her -- and he became her Ã¢ÂÂfavorite playmate.Ã¢ÂÂ The bombshell was revealed Tuesday during opening statements in a corruption trial against Maureen and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,Ã¢ÂÂ NBC WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂs Julie Carey reported. More: Ã¢ÂÂThe couple arrived separately at federal court over the past two days, a sharp contrast to the united front they showed when they were indicted 10 days after he left office in January. Before the trial, they often held hands in the courthouse. Maureen's defense attorney, Bill Burck, said during opening statements Tuesday that not only was the couple's marriage a wreck, but that Maureen developed feelings for Williams as he took her on a designer clothes shopping trip and showered her with attention. Ã¢ÂÂYou'd even hear she had a crush on on him. Unfortunately, unlike the other man in her life, Jonnie Williams paid attention to her,Ã¢ÂÂ Burck said.Ã¢ÂÂ HereÃ¢ÂÂs whatÃ¢ÂÂs particularly stunning: The defense is trying to PROVE a romantic relationship; usually, itÃ¢ÂÂs the other way around.

179	"Fact Check: HillaryÃ¢ÂÂs Iowa Remarks

After months of character attacks from her opponents, Hillary responded with the facts. The following is a rundown of some of the contrasts that Hillary highlighted in her speech today in Iowa:

Hillary: Ã¢ÂÂA couple of my leading opponents, directly and through surrogates, have spent months criticizing me without having to answer any of their own questions. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve been attacking my character. As I have said repeatedly, I prefer to attack the problems of the country and let my opponents run their own campaigns.Ã¢ÂÂ

Sen. Obama attacked Hillary. [Fact Hub, 12/3/07]

Sen. Edwards criticized Hillary for using doubletalk in the debate. ""The Democratic debate on Tuesday was a defining moment in this election. From my perspective it is important for the next president of the United States to be honest and sincere and trust-worthy given what's happened with Bush over the last seven years. Instead of straight talk, there was a lot of doubletalk in the debate from Senator Clinton on some of the most important issues facing the American people."" [Edwards Statement, 11/3/07]

Hillary: Ã¢ÂÂWhen it comes to health care, one of my opponents believes itÃ¢ÂÂs acceptable to leave out 15 million Americans. That would be 100,000 here in Iowa. Leave them out from his health care plan because universal coverage might be too hard to achieve. I disagree. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think we should start by giving up on 15 million Americans. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why my health care plan covers everyone.Ã¢ÂÂ

Sen. ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs health care plan would leave 15 million uninsured. [Fact Hub, 11/19/07]

Hillary: Ã¢ÂÂWhen it comes to social security, one of my opponents uses the Republican talking points and has been open to raising the retirement age and cutting benefits. Now he says he is for lifting the payroll tax, which would be a trillion dollar tax increase. Again, I disagree. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think we should fix Social Security on the backs of our seniors and the middle class. I have always fought for Social Security, I have always stood up against privatization and as president, I will restore fiscal responsibility so we can keep Social Security as a sacred promise to our seniors.Ã¢ÂÂ

Sen. Obama refused to rule out raising the retirement age and cutting benefits for social security. [Fact Hub, 11/20/07]

Sen. Obama conceded that his plan on raising the cap for social security could impact middle income people. Sen. Obama said, Ã¢ÂÂWell, when IÃ¢ÂÂI am going to be listening to any ideas that are presented, but I think that the best way to approach this is to adjust the cap on the payroll tax.Ã¢ÂÂ When pressed on how he would structure the tax increase, Ã¢ÂÂWell, itÃ¢ÂÂyou know, I have not specified exactly how we would structure it. Conceivably, you might have the equivalent of a doughnut hole, although this one would be a good one, as opposed to the bad doughnut hole that Bush set up for, for prescription drugs where you have a gap between people who are of middle income and very wealthy people.Ã¢ÂÂ [Meet the Press, 11/11/07]

Hillary: Ã¢ÂÂWhen it comes to Iran, I took a stand for aggressive diplomacy. One of my opponents made a different choice: He didnÃ¢ÂÂt show up for the vote. He didnÃ¢ÂÂt speak out during a presidential debate that night. And finally, he decided to play politics and claim that the vote he missed Ã¢ÂÂ a vote for diplomacy Ã¢ÂÂ was really a vote for war. Well if he really thought it was a rush to war, why did he rush to campaign and miss the vote?Ã¢ÂÂ

Sen. Obama missed vote, and failed to speak out during a presidential debate. [Fact Hub, 11/20/07]

Sen. Obama criticized Hillary for voting to give George Bush the green light for Iran. Sen. Obama wrote, Ã¢ÂÂEven worse, the Bush administration could use the language in Lieberman-Kyl to justify an attack on Iran as a part of the ongoing war in IraqÃ¢ÂÂ¦I strongly differ with Sen. Hillary Clinton, who was the only Democratic presidential candidate to support this reckless amendment.Ã¢ÂÂ [New Hampshire Union Leader, 10/11/07]

Hillary: Ã¢ÂÂNow, thereÃ¢ÂÂs been a lot of talk about yes or no answers to complex questions. But most people donÃ¢ÂÂt know that for legislators who donÃ¢ÂÂt want to take a stand, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a third way to vote. Not yes, not no, but Ã¢ÂÂpresentÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ which is kind of like voting Ã¢ÂÂmaybe.Ã¢ÂÂ Well, in the Illinois State Senate, on issue after issue, my opponent voted Ã¢ÂÂpresent,Ã¢ÂÂ instead of yes or no. Seven of those votes were on a womenÃ¢ÂÂs right to choose. Two of those votes were on measures to protect families from gun violenceÃ¢ÂÂone of which was a measure about firing guns on or near school grounds.Ã¢ÂÂ

As a state senator, Sen. Obama voted 'present' on seven abortion bills, including a ban on 'partial birth abortion,' two parental notification laws and three 'born alive' bills. [HB382, Passed 49-3-4, 5/13/1997; SB230, Passed, 44-7-5, 3/18/1997; HB1900, Passed 38-10-9, 5/16/2001; SB562, Passed 39-7-11, 4/6/2001; SB1093, Passed 34-6-12, 3/30/2001; SB1094, Passed 33-6-13, 3/30/2001; SB1095, Passed 34-5-13, 3/30/2001]

As a state senator, Sen. Obama voted 'present' on a bill that would increase penalties for the use of a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school: The bill called for the mandatory adult persecution of a minor at least 15 years of age being tried for using a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school. [SB759, Passed 52-1-5, 3/25/1999]

As a state senator, Sen. Obama voted 'present' on a bill that would reduce the penalty for carrying a concealed weapon from a felony to a misdemeanor. [Concurrence in House Amendments 1 and 2 to SB71, Passed 36-14-9, 5/21/1997]

Hillary: Ã¢ÂÂA president canÃ¢ÂÂt vote Ã¢ÂÂpresent.Ã¢ÂÂ A president canÃ¢ÂÂt pick and choose which challenges he or she will face. My opponentÃ¢ÂÂs campaign said that voting Ã¢ÂÂpresentÃ¢ÂÂ was a strategy to provide political cover. The Chicago Tribune said the present votes were the equivalent of taking a pass. Well, instead of looking for political cover or taking a pass, we need a president who will take a stand. And stand there and do whatever is necessary for their country.Ã¢ÂÂ

Chicago Tribune: Sen. ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs explanation for 'present' votes is questionable; 'few of the other Democrats who voted Ã¢ÂÂpresentÃ¢ÂÂ on abortion bills recall such a strategy' as Sen. Obama did. Sen. Obama ""said he worked out an arrangement with abortion-rights advocates to encourage Democrats to vote Ã¢ÂÂpresentÃ¢ÂÂ on some bills if they feared a Ã¢ÂÂnoÃ¢ÂÂ would look insensitive and endanger their re-election. But few of the other Democrats who voted Ã¢ÂÂpresentÃ¢ÂÂ on abortion bills recall such a strategy. And, like Obama, they weren't politically vulnerable."" [Chicago Tribune, 05/03/07]"	0
180	"Recently when he was asked about President Trump retweeting a couple of videos that made a big fuzz in the media, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) stated that Trump had Ã¢ÂÂbeen one of the best presidentsÃ¢ÂÂ he ever served under.

OÃ¢ÂÂNeal stated Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm not aware of it. I donÃ¢ÂÂt pay much attention to his tweets. IÃ¢ÂÂll say this for you. HeÃ¢ÂÂs been one of the best presidents IÃ¢ÂÂve served under.Ã¢ÂÂ

AND THE REASONING IS, HEÃ¢ÂÂS NOT AFRAID TO MAKE DECISIONS. HEÃ¢ÂÂS NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON THE Ã¢ÂÂ THE BIG MOUTHS AROUND HERE.Ã¢ÂÂ

OÃ¢ÂÂNeal continued, Ã¢ÂÂThe president is smart, powerful and a good counterpuncher.I think he attacks anyone he perceives or believes is attacking him or the country.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂHe should be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.Ã¢ÂÂ OÃ¢ÂÂNeal added.

Ã¢ÂÂTHE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO START FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH HIM INSTEAD OF CRITICIZING AND WASTING THEIR TIME ON STUPID THINGS.Ã¢ÂÂ HE CONCLUDED.

And Also What Ken Langone told CNBC:

If President Donald Trump is able to keep defying expectations Ã¢ÂÂ like he did in the election Ã¢ÂÂ and push through legislative changes against great odds, he could go down as Ã¢ÂÂone of our greatest presidents ever,Ã¢ÂÂ Ken Langone told CNBC on Monday.

Langone, a longtime Republican supporter and the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, said the Trump presidency offers the GOP, which also controls the House and the Senate, a unique time to deliver on the reasons Americans voted for a political outsider for the White House.

Voters are Ã¢ÂÂfed up,Ã¢ÂÂ Langone said on Ã¢ÂÂSquawk Box.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThey did a very dramatic, earth-shattering thing,Ã¢ÂÂ and now want results, he said.

Langone warned the Republicans that they could lose their majorities in the House and the Senate if lawmakers fail to seize this Trump-created opportunity. Ã¢ÂÂWe own the next 25 years as a nation [if we act].Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂIf you guys donÃ¢ÂÂt get your guys into a room and say Ã¢ÂÂGuys this is our moment.Ã¢ÂÂ The American people will throw you out too, the next time,Ã¢ÂÂ he warned House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy who also appeared as a guest Monday on Ã¢ÂÂSquawk Box.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂ[Trump] has the capacity to go down as one of our greatest presidents everÃ¢ÂÂ if heÃ¢ÂÂs able to bring about big changes in health care, tax cuts and $1 trillion of infrastructure upgrades, Langone said.

Ã¢ÂÂThe American people elected him president, in my mind, for one reason: they donÃ¢ÂÂt want incremental change. They want major change,Ã¢ÂÂ said Langone, founder and CEO of investment bank Invemed Associates, specializing in health-care and high-technology companies

The Home Depot co-founder also came out in favor of the House GOPÃ¢ÂÂs border adjustment tax provision to help pay for their overall effort to cut corporate taxes.



Many retailers are against the idea of taxing imports, saying it will force them to raise prices.

But Langone argued that retailers, like Home Depot, would be better off in the long term if theyÃ¢ÂÂre able to Ã¢ÂÂthink beyond the next quarter or the next six months.Ã¢ÂÂ

Last month, The Washington Post reported that white nationalists have begun using Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a recruitment tool. Now, the polarizing Republican presidential front-runner has become the recruitment fodder for another group of marginalized extremists. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight A propaganda video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab includes a clip of Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims from entering the country, according to news reports. Trump made the statement following the Islamic State-inspired shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., last month.

The video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon African Americans to join a holy war against the United States, according to the BBC.

Claiming the United States is a hotbed of racial inequality, police brutality and anti-Muslim sentiment, the film is an indictment of U.S. race relations and also includes historical civil rights-era footage of Malcolm X, an unnamed white supremacist and African Americans in prison, according to CNN.

The clip showing Trump, the BBC noted, arrives 10 minutes into the 51-minute propaganda video.

On either side of the Trump footage, NBC reported, are clips of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late al-Qaeda recruiter, urging Muslims in the United States to move to Islamic countries or wage war against the West at home. A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.

Ã¢ÂÂYesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,Ã¢ÂÂ Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.

He adds: Ã¢ÂÂThe West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.Ã¢ÂÂ

The al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.

TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in Biloxi, Miss. They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists.

Some wondered whether the video was real. More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear.

Ã¢ÂÂISIS, Al-Shabaad, al-Qaeda, all those groups Ã¢ÂÂ they donÃ¢ÂÂt want Trump in office,Ã¢ÂÂ said Richard Coyne, 52, an Army veteran from nearby Gulfport, who retired last year. Ã¢ÂÂThey want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-ISIS, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-Muslim.Ã¢ÂÂ ISIS is another name for the extremist group Islamic State.

Sarah Anderson, 57, of Hattiesburg, also an Army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the Berlin Wall, said that any terrorist group that cited Trump was doing so because it is Ã¢ÂÂscared to death of him.Ã¢ÂÂ

Share this article Share

Ã¢ÂÂHeÃ¢ÂÂs a threat to them,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want.Ã¢ÂÂ

Some voters were unaware of the video but well aware that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had warned of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists. Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.

Ã¢ÂÂI canÃ¢ÂÂt comprehend anything that the Democrats say,Ã¢ÂÂ Simmons said. Ã¢ÂÂThe terrorists fear Trump right now. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.Ã¢ÂÂ

In controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for Ã¢ÂÂa total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countryÃ¢ÂÂs representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.Ã¢ÂÂ

The propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word Ã¢ÂÂhell,Ã¢ÂÂ according to CNN.

In the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would Ã¢ÂÂstrongly considerÃ¢ÂÂ shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.

Ã¢ÂÂI would hate to do it, but itÃ¢ÂÂs something that youÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred Ã¢ÂÂ the absolute hatred Ã¢ÂÂ is coming from these areas,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump said in an interview on Ã¢ÂÂMorning Joe.Ã¢ÂÂ

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lied about him at Saturday's debate and is demanding an apology. (Video: ABC News/NBC News)

The video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between Trump and Hillary Clinton, in which Clinton has claimed TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs language aids jihadists.

Ã¢ÂÂIf you go on Arabic television, as we have, and you look at what is being blasted out Ã¢ÂÂ video of Mr Trump being translated to Arabic,Ã¢ÂÂ Clinton said at an Iowa town hall last month. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂNo Muslims coming to the United States,Ã¢ÂÂ other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements Ã¢ÂÂ it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists.Ã¢ÂÂ

TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs comments, Clinton added, Ã¢ÂÂlights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways.Ã¢ÂÂ

Trump responded to ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs assertion by calling her Ã¢ÂÂa liar.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs just another Hillary lie,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump said on NBC NewsÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂMeet the PressÃ¢ÂÂ late last month. Ã¢ÂÂSheÃ¢ÂÂs a liar, and everybody knows that.Ã¢ÂÂ

182	"WITH THE EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS GROWING WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY, MANY DOUBT THAT EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ITS SELF-INFLICTED IMMIGRATION WOUNDS.

Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations. While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and LondonÃ¢ÂÂs Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.

In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. Ã¢ÂÂWe do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,Ã¢ÂÂ Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.

Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:

Ã¢ÂÂThe new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂIt means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.Ã¢ÂÂ

Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we donÃ¢ÂÂt take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.



The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:

Ã¢ÂÂThere is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists Ã¢ÂÂ and even Ã¢ÂÂmoderateÃ¢ÂÂ Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.Ã¢ÂÂ

Yes, thatÃ¢ÂÂs rightÃ¢ÂÂbecause apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow Ã¢ÂÂintolerant.Ã¢ÂÂ Well do you know what most Americans think?

YouÃ¢ÂÂre damn right itÃ¢ÂÂs intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500Ã¢ÂÂs AD? We shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.

Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is Ã¢ÂÂunfair,Ã¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂdiscriminates,Ã¢ÂÂ against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.

Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out thereÃ¢ÂÂ6th safest in the world, to be exact.

Ã¢ÂÂAlthough Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.Ã¢ÂÂ

After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.

With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving."	1

184	"July 25, 2010 Ã¢ÂÂ -- TAPPER: Secretary Geithner thanks for joining us. Good to see you.

So, the administration has had a number of successes after big battles, stimulus, health care legislation, new rules for Wall Street, but you have a big battle coming when it comes to the Bush tax cuts.

If they remain in place, as Republicans want, it will cost three trillion dollars every ten years. The administration has said it wants to keep the ones for people who make under $200,000 a year, individuals and $250,000 for couples.

That will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years.

Ben Bernanke the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that with the economic outlook unusually uncertain, extending the Bush tax cuts would have a stimulative effect on the economy. Is he right?

GEITHNER: I don't think it should be a battle, Jake. You know, what the President's proposing to do is to leave in place, to extend tax cuts that go to more than 95 percent of working Americans and to leave in place tax cuts that are very important to incent businesses to hire new pe -- new employees and to invest in expanding output.

We think that's a -- the -- it's a very strong package. We think it's the right package. We think it's fair. We think it's responsible.

Now, we also think it's responsible to let the tax cuts expire that just go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans. We think that's the responsible thing to do because we need to make sure we can show the world that they're willing as a country now to start to make some progress bringing down our long -- our long-term deficits.

TAPPER: Don't you think it will slow economic growth?

GEITHNER: No. Just letting those tax cuts that only go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans in the country expire. I do not believe it will have a negative effect on growth.

TAPPER: This package that you're talking about pushing in Congress to -- to save the Bush tax cuts for people under $200,000 individuals and 250 for couples --

GEITHNER: And in fact, we go beyond that. Because you know, we're proposing to extend the make or pay tax cut which also goes to 95 percent of working Americans. And a set of very important business tax cuts targeted for small businesses themselves, expensing, zero capital gains rate for investment in small businesses. These things, we think, are very helpful, very powerful.

TAPPER: And when are you talking about pushing that into Congress?

GEITHNER: Congress is on the verge of what we hope will be enactment of a very strong package of tax measures for small businesses and ways to help them get credit so they can expand.

TAPPER: So, before the election?

GEITHNER: Oh, absolutely.

TAPPER: A number of Senate democrats, moderate Senate democrats have said that they oppose repealing or allowing to expire the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans that they think that would be harmful to growth.

Are you guys going to have the votes to get through the package you want which is focused more on middle and lower income America?

GEITHNER: Oh absolutely. I believe we will.

TAPPER: Some in the administration and internal discussions are talking about maybe just keeping all the Bush tax cuts for a year or two. Those aren't -- that's not going to happen?

GEITHNER: I don't believe it should and I don't believe it will. Again, because what the president's proposed is to make sure we're leaving them in place for the people that need the most and can make the most difference in helping make sure this economy comes back. That we heal the damage caused by this crisis.

TAPPER: Job creation has not gone as well as you hoped. What more can you do? I know there's this small business lending initiative. What more can you do given the lack of appetite on Capitol Hill for any spending programs? Any more stimulus?

GEITHNER: Well you know, the President's proposed a very strong package of help for small businesses which you just referred to. He'd support giving more support to states so they can keep teachers in the classroom.

TAPPER: Fifty billion dollars in emergency spending but the Congress has not acted on that.

GEITHNER: They haven't yet, but we can (inaudible) case for doing it. They're going to, we're going to keep at that. But right now, the best thing the government can do in addition to those things, is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again.

Now, we've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector. That's pretty good.

TAPPER: By the private sector.

GEITHNER: Pretty good this early in a recession.

TAPPER: Although you count in the public sector with the layoffs and the census jobs.

GEITHNER: But only because of census. But you know, what matters is -- is the private sector starting to hire people, add back hours and that's what's critical.

And you're seeing that happen now. Now we want it -- we want to see it happen at a faster pace. But I think most people understand that you know, this was a deep crisis. The scars ran very deep. Devastating damage. It's going to take time to repair that damage, take time to grow out of this. But we're making progress.

TAPPER: In 2009 when President Obama talked about unemployment insurance extensions he talked about how it was paid for. This time, it was not paid for, the $34 billion in unemployment insurance extensions became added to the national debt.

Republicans on Capitol Hill argued that they wanted to pay for it and they supported it but they just wanted it offset by spending cuts.

Given the fact that we're going to be -- we're going to have unemployment for the foreseeable future, high unemployment. Isn't it the fiscally responsible thing to do to not treat this as emergency spending but treat this as something we know is coming down the pike so we're not just laying this burden on our future generations?

GEITHNER: I don't think so. In a crisis that was this bad and a recession that was that deep. With this amount of lasting damage, scars from recovery, it's appropriate to treat these things as emergencies."	0

186	"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Robert Gates will consider sending some 3,000 Marines to Afghanistan to thwart any spring offensive by Taliban militants, the Pentagon said on Wednesday.

Ã¢ÂÂThis proposal is coming before the secretary this week,Ã¢ÂÂ Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said. Ã¢ÂÂHe will take it and consider it thoroughly before approving it.Ã¢ÂÂ

Violence has surged in Afghanistan over the past two years, with the hardline Islamist Taliban fighting a guerrilla war in the south and east and carrying out high-profile suicide and car bombings across the country.

For months, Gates has pressed NATO allies to provide more troops for Afghanistan. But if the Pentagon chief backs the proposal, it will show Washington has concluded it will have to provide a large share of any extra combat forces.

Gates ordered a boost in U.S. forces early last year in response to the violence and the United States currently has some 27,000 troops in Afghanistan -- a record high.

Around half the U.S. troops serve in a 40,000-strong NATO-led security assistance force while the rest conduct missions ranging from counter-terrorism to training Afghan troops.

While NATO says it thwarted last yearÃ¢ÂÂs attempted Taliban spring offensive, overall violence is up 27 percent over a year ago and it has risen by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand, the U.S. military said last month.

IN PLACE BY APRIL

Morrell said most of the Marines would go to southern Afghanistan, where British, Canadian and Dutch troops have done much of the fighting.

Ã¢ÂÂThe idea is to get this in place to prevent, as we did last spring, another attempt by the Taliban to come back,Ã¢ÂÂ he told reporters. Ã¢ÂÂThe timing is that they would be in place by April. This is a one-time seven-month deployment.Ã¢ÂÂ

After meeting allies in Scotland last month, Gates signaled a shift away from pressing NATO nations to make politically difficult decisions to provide combat troops.

He suggested the allies could help with other areas of the mission of rebuilding Afghanistan. But that shift means the United States must shoulder more of the combat burden.

Ã¢ÂÂThe commander needs additional forces there. Our allies are not in a position to provide them so we are now looking at perhaps carrying a bit of that additional load,Ã¢ÂÂ Morrell said.

U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban government in late 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks on the United States.

Morrell said the plan to send the Marines would be contained in a schedule of deployment proposals presented to Gates on Friday.

The plan would involve the deployment of a unit called a Marine Air Ground Task Force to fight in southern Afghanistan, and a Marine battalion to train Afghan forces.

The PentagonÃ¢ÂÂs Joint Staff developed the plan after a request from Adm. William Fallon, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, and it has the support of Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a U.S. military official said."	0

With the new laws in effect in Colorado, major sports organizations are looking for ways to cash in on the newest legal cash crop in the state.

Sources are reporting that Major League BaseballÃ¢ÂÂs Colorado Rockies plan to sell food items which contain marijuana at concession stands during games next season.

The first item on the list? Pot Brownies.

An official within the Rockies organization stated that the Rockies organization has given the green light to concession stands selling marijuana brownies.

High ranking officials in the Rockies organization say they are thrilled at the new menu item since they note that it will bring in tens of thousands of dollars per month.

The Rockies head office is hoping that the sale of marijuana brownies will also boost sales of other concession items. What better way to sell concessions that to give everyone in the stadium the munchies?

SIDENOTE: An inside source with the organization said that it appears that the strain of marijuana that will be used in the making of the marijuana brownies will be Durango Bango which is considered to be the very best weed in the Rocky Mountain State."	1

Speech Transcript

OBAMA: It is wonderful to be back at G.W. I want you to know that one of the reasons that I worked so hard with Democrats and Republicans to keep the government open was so that I could show up here today.

(LAUGHTER)

I want to make sure that all of you had one more excuse to skip class.

(LAUGHTER)

You're welcome.

(LAUGHTER)

I want to give a special thanks to Steven Knapp, the president of G.W. I just saw him. Where is he?

There he is, right here.

(APPLAUSE)

I want to -- we've got a lot of distinguished guests here. A couple of people I want to acknowledge.

First of all, my outstanding vice president, Joe Biden, is here.

(APPLAUSE)

Our secretary of the treasury, Tim Geithner, is in the house.

(APPLAUSE)

Jack Lew, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.

(APPLAUSE)

Gene Sperling, chair of the National Economic Council, is here.

(APPLAUSE)

Members of our bipartisan fiscal commission are here, including the two outstanding chairs -- Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson are here.

(APPLAUSE)

And we have a umber of members of Congress here today. I'm grateful for all of you taking the time to attend.

What we've been debating here in Washington over the last few weeks will affect the lives of the students here and families all across America in potentially profound ways.

This debate over budgets and deficits is about more than just numbers on a page, it's about more than just cutting and spending. It's about the kind of future that we want.

OBAMA: It's about the kind of country that we believe in. And that's what I want to spend some time talking about today.

From our first days as a nation, we have put our faith in free markets and free enterprise as the engine of America's wealth and prosperity. And more than citizens of any other country, we are rugged individualists, a self-reliant people with a healthy skepticism of too much government.

But there has always been another thread running through our history: a belief that we're all connected and that there are some things we can only do together, as a nation.

We believe, in the words of the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, that through government, we should do together what we cannot do as well for ourselves.

And so we've built a strong military to keep us secure, and public schools and universities to educate our citizens. We've laid down railroads and highways to facilitate travel and commerce.

OBAMA: We've supported the work of scientists and researchers whose discoveries have saved lives, unleashed repeated technological revolutions, and led to countless new jobs and entire new industries.

Each of us has benefited from these investments, and we're a more prosperous country as a result.

Now, part of this American belief that we're all connected also expresses itself in a conviction that each one of us deserves some basic measure of security and dignity.

We recognize that, no matter how responsibly we live our lives, hard times or bad luck, a crippling illness or a layoff may strike any one of us. ""There but for the grace of God go I,"" we say to ourselves.

And so we contribute to programs like Medicare and Social Security, which guarantee us health care and a measure of basic income after a lifetime of hard work; unemployment insurance, which protects us against unexpected job loss; and Medicaid, which provides care for millions of seniors in nursing homes, poor children, those with disabilities.

OBAMA: We're a better country because of these commitments.

I'll go further: We would not be a great country without those commitments.

And for much of the last century, our nation found a way to afford these investments and priorities with the taxes paid by its citizens. As a country that values fairness, wealthier individuals have traditionally borne a greater share of this burden than the middle class or those less fortunate; everybody pays, but the wealthier have borne a little more.

This is not because we begrudge those who've done well. We rightly celebrate their success.

Instead, it's a basic reflection of our belief that those who benefited most from our way of life can afford to give back a little -- a little bit more.

OBAMA: Moreover, this belief hasn't hindered the success of those at the top of the income scale. They continue to do better and better with each passing year.

Now, at certain times -- particularly during war or recession -- our nation has had to borrow money to pay for some of our priorities. And as most families understand, a little credit card debt isn't going to hurt, if it's temporary.

But as far back as the 1980s, America started amassing debt at more alarming levels, and our leaders began to realize that a larger challenge was on the horizon.

They knew that eventually, the baby boom generation would retire, which meant a much bigger portion of our citizens would be relying on programs like Medicare, Social Security and possibly Medicaid.

Like parents with young children who know they have to start saving for the college years, America had to start borrowing less and saving more to prepare for the retirement of an entire generation.

To meet this challenge, our leaders came together three times during the 1990s to reduce our nation's deficit -- three times. They forged historic agreements that required tough decisions made by the first President Bush, then made by President Clinton, by Democratic Congresses and by a Republican Congress.

All three agreements asked for shared responsibility and shared sacrifice, but they largely protected the middle class, they largely protected our commitments to seniors, they protected our key investments in our future.

As a result of these bipartisan efforts, America's finances were in great shape by the year 2000. We went from deficit to surplus. America was actually on track to becoming completely debt-free, and we were prepared for the retirement of the baby boomers.

But after Democrats and Republicans committed to fiscal discipline during the 1990s, we lost our way in the decade that followed. We increased spending dramatically for two wars and an expensive prescription drug program, but we didn't pay for any of this new spending.

OBAMA: Instead we made the problem worse with trillions of dollars in unpaid-for tax cuts; tax cuts that went to every millionaire and billionaire in the country; tax cuts that will force us to borrow an average of $500 billion every year over the next decade.

To give you an idea of how much damage this caused to our nation's checkbook, consider this.

In the last decade, if we had simply found a way to pay for the tax cuts and the prescription drug benefit, our deficit would currently be at low historical levels in the coming years.

But that's not what happened. And so, by the time I took office, we once again found ourselves deeply in debt and unprepared for a baby boom retirement that is now starting to take place.

When I took office, our projected deficit annually was more than $1 trillion. On top of that, we faced a terrible financial crisis and a recession that, like most recessions, led us to temporarily borrow even more.

In this case, we took a series of emergency steps that saved millions of jobs, kept credit flowing, and provided working families extra money in their pocket. It was absolutely the right thing to do, but these steps were expensive and added to our deficits in the short term.

So that's how our fiscal challenge was created. That's how we got here. And now that our economic recovery is gaining strength, Democrats and Republicans must come together and restore the fiscal responsibility that served us so well in the 1990s.

We have to live within our means. We have to reduce our deficit. And we have to get back on a path that will allow us to pay down our debt.

OBAMA: And we have to do it in a way that protects the recovery, protects the investments we need to grow, creates jobs, and helps us win the future.

Now, before I get into how we can achieve this goal, some of you, particularly the younger people here -- you don't qualify, Joe...

(LAUGHTER)

... some of you might be wondering, ""Why is this so important? Why does this matter to me?""

Well, here's why.

Even after our economy recovers, our government will still be on track to spend more money than it takes in throughout this decade and beyond. That means we'll have to keep borrowing more from countries like China.

That means more of your tax dollars each year will go towards paying off the interest on all of the loans that we keep taking out. By the end of this decade, the interest that we owe on our debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion. Think about that. That's the interest, just the interest payments.

Then, as the baby boomers start to retire in greater numbers and health care costs continue to rise, the situation will get even worse.

By 2025, the amount of taxes we currently pay will only be enough to finance our health care programs, Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security, and the interest we owe on our debt. That's it. Every other national priority -- education, transportation, even our national security -- will have to be paid for with borrowed money.

Now, ultimately all this rising debt will cost us jobs and damage our economy. It will prevent us from making the investments we need to win the future.

OBAMA: We won't be able to afford good schools, new research, or the repair of roads; all the things that create new jobs and businesses here in America.

Businesses will be less likely to invest and open shop in a country that seems unwilling or unable to balance its books. And if our creditors start worrying that we may be unable to pay back our debts, that could drive up interest rates for everybody who borrows money, making it harder for businesses to expand and hire or families to take out a mortgage.

Here's the good news: That doesn't have to be our future; that doesn't have to be the country that we leave our children.

We can solve this problem. We came together as Democrats and Republicans to meet this challenge before; we can do it again. But that starts by being honest about what's causing our deficit.

You see, most Americans tend to dislike government spending in the abstract, but like the stuff that it buys.

Most of us, regardless of party affiliation, believe that we should have a strong military and a strong defense. Most Americans believe we should invest in education and medical research. Most Americans think we should protect commitments like Social Security and Medicare.

And without even looking at a poll, my finely honed political instincts tell me that almost nobody believes they should be paying higher taxes.

(LAUGHTER)

So because all this spending is popular with both Republicans and Democrats alike, and because nobody wants to pay higher taxes, politicians are often eager to feed the impression that solving the problem is just a matter of eliminating waste and abuse.

OBAMA: You'll hear that phrase a lot: ""We just need to eliminate waste and abuse.""

The implication is that tackling the deficit issue won't require tough choices.

Or politicians suggest that we can somehow close our entire deficit by eliminating things like foreign aid, even though foreign aid makes up about 1 percent of our entire federal budget.

So here's the truth.

Around two-thirds of our budget -- two-thirds -- is spent on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and national security -- two- thirds.

Programs like unemployment insurance, student loans, veterans' benefits and tax credits for working families take up another 20 percent.

What's left, after interest on the debt, is just 12 percent for everything else. That's 12 percent for all of our national priorities: education, clean energy, medical research, transportation, our national parks, food safety, keeping our air and water clean. You name it, all of that accounts for 12 percent of our budget.

Now, up 'til now, the debate here in Washington -- the cuts proposed by a lot of folks in Washington have focused almost exclusively on that 12 percent.

OBAMA: But cuts to that 12 percent alone won't solve the problem. So any serious plan to tackle our deficit will require us to put everything on the table and take on excess spending wherever it exists in the budget.

A serious plan doesn't require us to balance our budget overnight. In fact, economists think that with the economy just starting to grow again we need a phased-in approach. But it does require tough decisions and support from our leaders in both parties now. Above all, it will require us to choose a vision of the America we want to see five years, 10 years, 20 years down the road.

Now, to their credit, one vision has been presented and championed by Republicans in the House of Representatives and embraced by several of their party's presidential candidates. It's a plan that aims to reduce our deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years, and one that addresses the challenge of Medicare and Medicaid in the years after that.

Those are both worthy goals. They're worthy goals for us to achieve.

But the way this plan achieves those goals would lead to a fundamentally different America than the one we've known, certainly in my lifetime. In fact, I think it would be fundamentally different than what we've known throughout our history.

A 70 percent cut in clean energy, a 25 percent cut in education, a 30 percent cut in transportation, cuts in college Pell Grants that will grow to more than $1,000 per year.

OBAMA: That's the proposal.

These aren't the kind of cuts you make when you're trying to get rid of some waste or find extra savings in the budget. These aren't the kind of cuts that the fiscal commission proposed.

These are the kind of cuts that tell us we can't afford the America that I believe in and I think you believe in.

I believe it paints a vision of our future that is deeply pessimistic. It's a vision that says if our roads crumble and our bridges collapse, we can't afford to fix them; if there are bright young Americans who have the drive and the will but not the money to go to college, we can't afford to send them.

Go to China and you'll see businesses opening research labs and solar facilities.

South Korean children are outpacing our kids in math and science. They're scrambling to figure out how they put more money into education.

Brazil is investing billions in new infrastructure and can run half their cars not on high-priced gasoline, but on biofuels.

And yet, we are presented with a vision that says the American people, the United States of America, the greatest nation on Earth, can't afford any of this.

It's a vision that says America can't afford to keep the promise we've made to care for our seniors. It says that 10 years from now, if you're a 65-year-old who's eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today.

It says, instead of guaranteed health care, you will get a voucher. And if that voucher isn't worth enough to buy the insurance that's available in the open marketplace, well, tough luck; you're on your own.

Put simply, it ends Medicare as we know it.

It's a vision that says up to 50 million Americans have to lose their health insurance in order for us to reduce the deficit.

OBAMA: Who are these 50 million Americans?

Many are somebody's grandparents, maybe one of yours, who wouldn't be able afford nursing home care without Medicaid.

Many are poor children. Some are middle-class families who have children with autism or Down's syndrome. Some are these kids with disabilities are -- the disabilities are so severe that they require 24-hour care.

These are the Americans we'd be telling to fend for themselves.

And, worst of all, this is a vision that says even though Americans can't afford to invest in education at current levels or clean energy, even though we can't afford to maintain our commitment on Medicare and Medicaid, we can somehow afford more than $1 trillion in new tax breaks for the wealthy.

Think about that.

In the last decade, the average income of the bottom 90 percent of all working Americans actually declined. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent saw their income rise by an average of more than a quarter of a million dollars each. That's who needs to pay less taxes?

They want to give people like me a $200,000 tax cut that's paid for by asking 33 seniors to each pay $6,000 more in health costs.

That's not right, and that's not going to happen as long as I'm president.

(APPLAUSE)

This vision is less about reducing the deficit than it is about changing the basic social compact in America. Ronald Reagan's own budget director said there's nothing serious or courageous about this plan.

OBAMA: There's nothing serious about a plan that claims to reduce the deficit by spending a trillion dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. And I don't think there's anything courageous about asking for sacrifice from those who can least afford it and don't have any clout on Capitol Hill. That's not a vision of the America I know.

The America I know is generous and compassionate. It's a land of opportunity and optimism. Yes, we take responsibility for ourselves, but we also take responsibility for each other, for the country we want and the future that we share.

We're a nation that built a railroad across a continent and brought light to communities shrouded in darkness. We sent a generation to college on the G.I. Bill and we saved millions of seniors from poverty with Social Security and Medicare.

We have led the world in scientific research and technological breakthroughs that have transformed millions of lives.

That's who we are. This is the America that I know.

We don't have to choose between a future of spiraling debt and one where we forfeit our investment in our people and our country.

To meet our fiscal challenge, we will need to make reforms, we will all need to make sacrifices. But we do not have to sacrifice the America we believe in. And as long as I'm president, we won't.

So today I'm proposing a more balanced approach to achieve $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 12 years. It's an approach that borrows from the recommendations of the bipartisan fiscal commission that I appointed last year, and it builds on the roughly $1 trillion in deficit reduction I already proposed in my 2012 budget.

OBAMA: It's an approach that puts every kind of spending on the table, but one that protects the middle class, our promise to seniors and our investments in the future.

The first step in our approach is to keep annual domestic spending low by building on the savings that both parties agreed to last week. That step alone will save us about $750 billion over 12 years.

We will make the tough cuts necessary to achieve these savings, including in programs that I deeply care about. But I will not sacrifice the core investments that we need to grow and create jobs. We will invest in medical research. We will invest in clean energy technology. We will invest in new roads and airports and broadband access. We will invest in education. We will invest in job training. We will do what we need to do to compete, and we will win the future.

The second step in our approach is to find additional savings in our defense budget.

Now, as commander in chief, I have no greater responsibility than protecting our national security, and I will never accept cuts that compromise our ability to defend our homeland or America's interests around the world.

But as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mullen, has said, the greatest long-term threat to America's national security is America's debt.

OBAMA: So just as we must find more savings in domestic programs, we must do the same in defense. And we can do that while still keeping ourselves safe.

Over the last two years, Secretary Bob Gates has courageously taken on wasteful spending, saving $400 billion in current and future spending. I believe we can do that again.

We need to not only eliminate waste and improve efficiency and effectiveness, but we're going to have to conduct a fundamental review of America's missions, capabilities, and our role in a changing world.

I intend to work with Secretary Gates and the Joint Chiefs on this review, and I will make specific decisions about spending after it's complete.

The third step in our approach is to further reduce health care spending in our budget. Now, here the difference with the House Republican plan could not be clearer.

Their plan essentially lowers the government's health care bills by asking seniors and poor families to pay them instead. Our approach lowers the government's health care bills by reducing the cost of health care itself.

Already, the reforms we passed in the health care law will reduce our deficit by $1 trillion. My approach would build on those -- these reforms.

We will reduce wasteful subsidies and erroneous payments. We will cut spending on prescription drugs by using Medicare's purchasing power to drive greater efficiency and speed generic brands of medicine onto the market. We will work with governors of both parties to demand more efficiency and accountability from Medicaid.

We will change the way we pay for health care: not by the procedure or the number of days spent in a hospital, but with new incentives for doctors and hospitals to prevent injuries and improve results.

And we will slow the growth of Medicare costs by strengthening an independent commission of doctors, nurses, medical experts and consumers who will look at all the evidence and recommend the best ways to reduce unnecessary spending while protecting access to the services that seniors need.

Now, we believe the reforms we've proposed to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid will enable us to keep these commitments to our citizens while saving us $500 billion by 2023, and an additional $1 trillion in the decade after that.

OBAMA: But if we're wrong, and Medicare costs rise faster than we expect, then this approach will give the independent commission the authority to make additional savings by further improving Medicare.

But let me be absolutely clear: I will preserve these health care programs as a promise we make to each other in this society. I will not allow Medicare to become a voucher program that leaves seniors at the mercy of the insurance industry, with a shrinking benefit to pay for rising costs. I will not tell families with children who have disabilities that they have to fend for themselves.

We will reform these programs, but we will not abandon the fundamental commitment this country has kept for generations.

That includes, by the way, our commitment to Social Security. While Social Security is not the cause of our deficit, it faces real long-term challenges in a country that's growing older.

As I said in the State of the Union, both parties should work together now to strengthen Social Security for future generations. But we have to do it without putting at risk current retirees or the most vulnerable or people with disabilities, without slashing benefits for future generations and without subjecting Americans' guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market. And it can be done.

The fourth step in our approach is to reduce spending in the tax code, so-called tax expenditures.

In December, I agreed to extend the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans because it was the only way I could prevent a tax hike on middle-class Americans.

OBAMA: But we cannot afford $1 trillion worth of tax cuts for every millionaire and billionaire in our society. We can't afford it. And I refuse to renew them again.

Beyond that, the tax code is also loaded up with spending on things like itemized deductions. And while I agree with the goals of many of these deductions, from homeownership to charitable giving, we can't ignore the fact that they provide millionaires an average tax break of $75,000 but do nothing for the typical middle-class family that doesn't itemize.

So my budget calls for limiting itemized deductions for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans, a reform that would reduce the deficit by $320 billion over 10 years.

But to reduce the deficit, I believe we should go further. And that's why I'm calling on Congress to reform our individual tax code so that it is fair and simple, so that the amount of taxes you pay isn't determined by what kind of accountant you can afford.

I believe reform should protect the middle class, promote economic growth, and build on the fiscal commission's model of reducing tax expenditures so that there is enough savings to both lower rates and lower the deficit. And as I called for in the State of the Union, we should reform our corporate tax code as well, to make our businesses and our economy more competitive.

So this is my approach to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 12 years.

OBAMA: It's an approach that achieves about $2 trillion in spending cuts across the budget. It will lower our interest payments on the debt by $1 trillion. It calls for tax reform to cut about $1 trillion in tax expenditures -- spending in the tax code. And it achieves these goals while protecting the middle class, protecting our commitment to seniors and protecting our investments in the future.

Now, in the coming years, if the recovery speeds up and our economy grows faster than our current projections, we can make even greater progress than I've pledged here.

But just to hold Washington and to hold me accountable and make sure that the debt burden continues to decline, my plan includes a debt failsafe.

If, by 2014, our debt is not projected to fall as a share of the economy, if we haven't hit our targets, if Congress has failed to act, then my plan will require us to come together and make up the additional savings with more spending cuts and more spending reductions in the tax code.

And that should be an incentive for us to act boldly now, instead of kicking our problems further down the road.

So this is our vision for America, this is my vision for America, a vision where we live within our means while still investing in our future, where everyone makes sacrifices but no one bears all the burden, where we provide a basic measure of security for our citizens and we provide rising opportunity for our children.

There will be those who vigorously disagree with my approach. I can guarantee that as well.

(LAUGHTER)

Some will argue we should not even consider -- ever, ever -- raising taxes, even if only on the wealthiest Americans.

OBAMA: It's just an article of faith to them.

I say that at a time when the tax burden on the wealthy is at its lowest level in half a century, the most fortunate among us can afford to pay a little more.

I don't need another tax cut. Warren Buffett doesn't need another tax cut. Not if we have to pay for it by making seniors pay more for Medicare or by cutting kids from Head Start or by taking away college scholarships that I wouldn't be here without, and that some of you wouldn't be here without.

And here's the thing: I believe that most wealthy Americans would agree with me. They want to give back to their country, a country that's done so much for them. It's just Washington hasn't asked them to.

Others will say that we shouldn't even talk about cutting spending until the economy is fully recovered. These are mostly folks in my party.

I'm sympathetic to this view, which is one of the reasons I supported the payroll tax cuts we passed in December. It's also why we have to use a scalpel and not a machete to reduce the deficit, so that we can keep making the investments that create jobs.

But doing nothing on the deficit is just not an option. Our debt has grown so large that we could do real damage to the economy if we don't begin a process now to get our fiscal house in order.

Finally, there are those who believe we shouldn't make any reforms to Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security out of fear that any talk of change to these programs will immediately usher in the sort of radical steps that House Republicans have proposed. And I understand those fears.

OBAMA: But I guarantee that if we don't make any changes at all, we won't be able to keep our commitment to a retiring generation that will live longer and will face higher health care costs than those who came before.

Indeed, to those in my own party, I say that if we truly believe in a progressive vision of our society, we have an obligation to prove that we can afford our commitments.

If we believe that government can make a difference in people's lives, we have the obligation to prove that it works, by making government smarter and leaner and more effective.

Of course, there are those who simply say there's no way we can come together at all and agree on a solution to this challenge. They'll say the politics of this city are just too broken, the choices are just too hard, the parties are just too far apart.

And after a few years on this job I have some sympathy for this view.

(LAUGHTER)

But I also know that we've come together before and met big challenges.

Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill came together to save Social Security for future generations.

The first President Bush and a Democratic Congress came together to reduce the deficit.

President Clinton and a Republican Congress battled each other ferociously -- disagreed on just about everything -- but they still found a way to balance the budget.

OBAMA: And in the last few months, both parties have come together to pass historic tax relief and spending cuts. And I know there are Republicans and Democrats in Congress who want to see a balanced approach to deficit reduction.

And even those Republicans I disagree with most strongly I believe are sincere about wanting to do right by their country. We may disagree on our visions, but I -- I -- I truly believe they want to do the right thing.

So I believe we can and must come together again.

This morning, I met with Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress to discuss the approach that I laid out today. And in early May, the vice president will begin regular meetings with leaders in both parties with the aim of reaching a final agreement on a plan to reduce the deficit and get it done by the end of June.

I don't expect the details in any final agreement to look exactly like the approach I laid out today. This is a democracy; that's not how things work. I'm eager to hear other ideas from all ends of the political spectrum.

And though I'm sure the criticism of what I've said here today will be fierce in some quarters and my critique of the House Republican approach has been strong, Americans deserve and will demand that we all make an effort to bridge our differences and find common ground.

This larger debate that we're having -- this larger debate about the size and the role of government -- it has been with us since our founding days. And during moments of great challenge and change, like the one that we're living through now, the debate gets sharper and it gets more vigorous. That's not a bad thing. In fact, it's a good thing.

OBAMA: As a country that prizes both our individual freedom and our obligations to one another, this is one of the most important debates that we can have.

But no matter what we argue, no matter where we stand, we've always held certain beliefs as Americans.

We believe that in order to preserve our own freedoms and pursue our own happiness, we can't just think about ourselves. We have to think about the country that made these liberties possible. We have to think about our fellow citizens with whom we share a community. And we have to think about what's required to preserve the American dream for future generations.

This sense of responsibility -- to each other and to our country -- this isn't a partisan feeling. This isn't a Democratic or a Republican idea. It's patriotism.

The other day I received a letter from a man in Florida. He started off by telling me he didn't vote for me and he hasn't always agreed with me. But even though he's worried about our economy and the state of our politics, here's what he said.

He said, ""I still believe. I believe in that great country that my grandfather told me about. I believe that somewhere lost in this quagmire of petty bickering on every news station, the American dream is still alive.""

""We need to use our dollars here rebuilding, refurbishing and restoring all that our ancestors struggled to create and maintain. We as a people must do this together, no matter the color of the "	0

Leader Boehner recorded the weekly address earlier this week from Ohio, where he ran a small business and saw first-hand how Washington can make it harder for employers and entrepreneurs to meet a payroll and create jobs. Following is a transcript of BoehnerÃ¢ÂÂs remarks. Audio of the Weekly Republican Address is available now here. The video will be available here for viewing and here for downloading.



Ã¢ÂÂHello. IÃ¢ÂÂm John Boehner.



Ã¢ÂÂBefore I served in Congress, I ran a small business here in Ohio, and I saw first-hand how politicians in Washington can make it harder for small employers to meet a payroll and create jobs.



Ã¢ÂÂIn the final days of the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama promised to Ã¢ÂÂchange this country and change the world.Ã¢ÂÂ



Ã¢ÂÂWell I donÃ¢ÂÂt know about the world, but here at home, Americans havenÃ¢ÂÂt experienced the change President Obama promised. One in ten of our fellow citizens is out of work. Our national debt has grown by $3 trillion Trust in government has fallen to an all-time low.



Ã¢ÂÂThese problems didnÃ¢ÂÂt start under President Obama. But instead of fixing them, his policies have made them worse. A Ã¢ÂÂstimulusÃ¢ÂÂ spending spree that created jobs in China and El Salvador, while millions of Americans lost their jobs here. A job-killing national energy tax. A government takeover of health care.



Ã¢ÂÂAll these things have combined to create massive uncertainty for small businesses, the engine of job creation in America, while our children face a future clouded by debt.



Ã¢ÂÂAmericans are demanding a new way forward in Washington Ã¢ÂÂ an approach that neither party has tried.



Ã¢ÂÂIt starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it; making government smaller and more accountable; and helping small businesses get back to creating jobs again.

Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs what Republicans are offering with our Pledge to America, a governing agenda built by listening to the people.



Ã¢ÂÂA generation of fiscal recklessness in Washington has pushed us to the brink. Just to stay afloat, weÃ¢ÂÂre now borrowing 41 cents of every dollars we spend from our kids and grandkids.



Ã¢ÂÂThis spending spree threatens our childrenÃ¢ÂÂs future. ItÃ¢ÂÂs also hurting our economy. Americans know it has to stop, and our Pledge to America puts forth a plan to do just that. WeÃ¢ÂÂre ready to cut spending to pre-Ã¢ÂÂstimulus,Ã¢ÂÂ pre-bailout levels, saving taxpayers $100 billion almost immediately. And weÃ¢ÂÂre ready to put in place strict budget caps that limit spending from here on out, to ensure that Washington is no longer on this spending binge.



Ã¢ÂÂWe need to stop the coming tax hike. We canÃ¢ÂÂt balance the budget without cutting spending and achieving real economic growth Ã¢ÂÂ and we wonÃ¢ÂÂt have real economic growth if we raise taxes on small businesses and families.



Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs a third thing we need to do to help our economy, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs change Congress itself. The American people are in charge of this country, and they deserve a Congress that acts like it. Americans should have three days to read all bills before Congress votes on them Ã¢ÂÂ something they didnÃ¢ÂÂt get when the Ã¢ÂÂstimulusÃ¢ÂÂ was rushed into law. We should put an end to so-called Ã¢ÂÂcomprehensiveÃ¢ÂÂ bills that make it easy to hide wasteful spending projects and job-killing policies. Bills should be written by legislators in committee in plain public view Ã¢ÂÂ not written in the SpeakerÃ¢ÂÂs office, behind closed doors.



Ã¢ÂÂAcross our nation, Americans are looking at President ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs policies and asking Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂwhere are the jobs?Ã¢ÂÂ To help our economy get back on track, we have to stop all of the coming tax hikes and cut spending Ã¢ÂÂ and to cut spending, we need to change Congress itself.



Ã¢ÂÂThis is a new way forward that hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been tried in Washington yet. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a break from the direction in which President Obama has taken our country. And frankly, itÃ¢ÂÂs also a break from the direction in which Republicans were headed when Americans last entrusted us with the reins of government. The American people are in charge, and they deserve nothing less.



Ã¢ÂÂTogether, we can do these things. And in doing so, we can begin the drive for a smaller, less costly, and more accountable government that honors our Constitution and respects the will of the people.



Ã¢ÂÂThese ideas are at the core of our Pledge to America.



Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve tried it President ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs way. WeÃ¢ÂÂve tried it WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂs way. It hasnÃ¢ÂÂt worked. ItÃ¢ÂÂs time to put the people back in charge.



Ã¢ÂÂThank you for your time and may God bless the United States of America."""	0

Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) talked about what went wrong for the Democratic Party in the 2014 midterm elections, and its plans for the 2016 elections. He talked about his plans for a new Ã¢ÂÂpact with the middle class,Ã¢ÂÂ saying that Democrats could become the dominant party for a generation if they showed the middle class that government could work for them.

193	"COSTA MESA, Ca. - GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to Ã¢ÂÂmake the military great again,Ã¢ÂÂ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs armed forces. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre bringing back the draft, okay? WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.

Ã¢ÂÂI love the Sixties,Ã¢ÂÂ said Trump, continuing, Ã¢ÂÂI was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.Ã¢ÂÂ In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. Ã¢ÂÂYou have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. WeÃ¢ÂÂre not going to give it to them, folks. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to earn their citizenship.Ã¢ÂÂ

Trump has repeatedly stated that he wonÃ¢ÂÂt rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing Ã¢ÂÂman-portableÃ¢ÂÂ tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre not going to have unquestionable military dominance if weÃ¢ÂÂre seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.Ã¢ÂÂ

Rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option Ã¢ÂÂextremelyÃ¢ÂÂ liberally. Ã¢ÂÂMy feeling is we have these weapons and weÃ¢ÂÂve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; thereÃ¢ÂÂs absolutely no reason why we shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be using them.Ã¢ÂÂ

The former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. Ã¢ÂÂThis guyÃ¢ÂÂs the president of the United States and heÃ¢ÂÂs bowing to the Chinese. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre laughing in our faces, okay? TheyÃ¢ÂÂre laughing in our faces and if we donÃ¢ÂÂt do something about it, theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to surpass us militarily and economically and then weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have a huge problem on our hands.Ã¢ÂÂ

Donald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County. The GOP presidential hopeful is scheduled to address CaliforniaÃ¢ÂÂs Republican convention on Friday."	1
194	"WASHINGTON, May 1, 2011 Ã¢ÂÂ -- AMANPOUR (voice-over): This week, budget blowback.

(UNKNOWN): We can't afford it, you moron!

AMANPOUR: As town halls across America erupt in anger over aplan to slash spending...

(UNKNOWN): You're a liar!

AMANPOUR: ... Republicans find themselves under fire.

(UNKNOWN): ... he was yelling at me, cursing at me.

AMANPOUR: I go to the heartland with the man behind the plan,House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.

RYAN: Let's prove to them that Wisconsinites can have a civildebate.

AMANPOUR: Then, in the crosshairs. A NATO bomb hits a housewith Gadhafi inside, killing his son and three grandchildren. Howwill the strongman strike back? And how does it all end?

(UNKNOWN): This was a direct operation to assassinate the leaderof this country.

AMANPOUR: What's the way out for the U.S.? A formeradministration insider weighs in.

Plus, we're live from the Vatican, as Pope John Paul II gets onestep closer to sainthood. Is the fast track too fast?

ANNOUNCER: Live from the Newseum in Washington, ""This Week"" withChristiane Amanpour starts right now.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: Welcome to our viewers here and around the world.There is a lot happening this Sunday, and we begin with unfolding newsin the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The Libyan government is condemningwhat it called, quote, ""a direct operation to assassinate MoammarGadhafi,"" this after a NATO bomb hit Gadhafi's compound. It sparedhim, but killed three of his grandchildren and his youngest son. Socould this be a game-changer in the war, which has dragged into astalemate in recent weeks?

We go live now to Libya for the very latest on the ground. ABC'sMiguel Marquez is in Benghazi, and the BBC's Christian Fraser is inTripoli, where the attack took place.

Christian, let's start with you. Is there a feeling now that thewar is entering a new phase around Tripoli?

FRASER: I think that's a very real possibility, Christiane. Theway that the press visit to this bomb site was orchestrated lastnight, it was very deliberately held back for two hours, and then wewere taken there and then given a press conference here at the hotel,in which Moussa Ibrahim spelled out what he thought the attack meantdoes suggest that they will try and make as much political capitalfrom this as they can.

Certainly, it puts pressure on NATO and its allies. And we'veseen already a very angry reaction from his supporters in Tripoli,reports of attacks on the U.S. embassy. I've spoken to U.N. officialstoday who say their offices were looted, also reports of attacks onthe British and Italian missions here in Tripoli.

The unknowns, of course, are what Colonel Gadhafi's response willbe. We've not heard from him yet. We don't know what the response ofhis supporters will be in the days ahead, and we don't know, really,what the sort of international reaction will be to what has unfoldedhere last night.

AMANPOUR: A lot of questions there, Christian, and we'llcontinue to monitor it.

Of course, the U.S. embassy is empty, because all of the staffhave been evacuated over the last several weeks and months. And nowwe go to the other side of this conflict and ABC's Miguel Marquez,who's in the east there in rebel-held Benghazi.

Miguel, what is the reaction from the rebels? Do they think thisattack could end the stalemate and signify a new -- a new impetus forthem?"	0

The following is the text of a chain e-mail that features Sen. John McCain's remarks about the Pledge of Allegiance, and an anecdote from his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.

John McCain's remarks about the Pledge of Allegiance

In light of the recent appeals court ruling in California, with respect to the Pledge of Allegiance, the following recollection from Senator John McCain is very appropriate:

'The Pledge of Allegiance' - by Senator John McCain

'As you may know, I spent five and one half years as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. In the early years of our imprisonme nt, the NVA kept us in solitary confinement or two or three to a cell. In 1971 the NVA moved us from these conditions of isolation into large rooms with as many as 30 to 40 men to a room.

This was, as you can imagine, a wonderful change and was a direct result of the efforts of millions of Americans on behalf of a few hundred POWs 10,000 miles from home.

One of the men who moved into my room was a young man named Mike Christian.

Mike came from a small town near Selma , Alabama . He didn't wear a pair of shoes until he was 13 years old. At 17, he enlisted in the US Navy. He later earned a commission by going to Officer Training School Then h e became a Naval Flight Officer and was shot down and captured in 1967. Mike had a keen and deep appreciation of the opportunities this country and our military provide for people who want to work and want to succeed.

As part of the change in treatment, the Vietnamese allowed some prisoners to receive packages from home. In some of these packages were handkerchiefs, scarves and other items of clothing.

Mike got himself a bamboo needle. Over a period of a couple of months, he created an American flag and sewed on the inside of his shirt.

Every afternoon, before we had a bowl of soup, we would hang Mike's shirt on the wall of t he cell and say the Pledge of Allegiance.

I know the Pledge of Allegiance may not seem the most important part of our day now, but I can assure you that in that stark cell it was indeed the most important and meaningful event.

One day the Vietnamese searched our cell, as they did periodically, and discovered Mike's shirt with the flag sewn inside, and removed it.

That evening they returned, opened the door of the cell, and for the benefit of all of us, beat Mike Christian severely for the next couple of hours. Then, they opened the door of the cell and threw him in. We cleaned him up as well as we could.

The cell in which we lived had a concrete slab in the middle on which we slept Four naked light bulbs hung in each corner of the room.

As I said, we tried to clean up Mike as well as we could. After the excitement died down, I looked in the corner of the room, and sitting there beneath that dim light bulb with a piece of red cloth, another shirt and his bamboo needle, was my friend, Mike Christian. He was sitting there with his eyes almost shut from the beating he had received, making another American flag. He was not making the flag because it made Mike Christian feel better. He was making that flag because he knew how important it was to us to be able to Pledge our allegiance to our flag and country.

So the next time you say the Pledge of Allegiance, you must never forget the sacrifice and courage that thousands of Americans have made to build our nation and promote freedom around the world. You must remember our duty, our honor, and our country.'

'I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'

PASS THIS ON... And on... And on! You can even send it back to me, I don't mind, because its worth reading again.

oh.....and then you have this clown, who refuses to place his hand on his heart and say the pledge...... Subject: Remember this picture on election day!

Let's all remember this on election day...if you have family serving in the military, make sure you send it along. I don't care for Hillary, but at least she shows respect for the country she lives in! I had heard about this but a picture is definitely worth 1000 words! God save us!!!

Senator Barack Obama, Governor Bill Richardson, Senator Hillary Clinton and Ruth Harkin stand during the national anthem.

Barack Hussein Obama's photo (that's his real name).....the article said he REFUSED TO NOT ONLY PUT HIS HAND ON HIS HEART DURING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, BUT REFUSED TO SAY THE PLEDGE.....how in the hell can a man like this expect to be our next C commander-in-Chief"	0

200	"It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, Ã¢ÂÂincluding thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.

It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no chargesÃ¢ÂÂ no trialÃ¢ÂÂjust belief.

His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 Ã¢ÂÂ teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught Ã¢ÂÂ and he wanted to attack this loophole. Ã¢ÂÂWhy donÃ¢ÂÂt we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?Ã¢ÂÂ Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parentsÃ¢ÂÂ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held Ã¢ÂÂ 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.

Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they donÃ¢ÂÂt want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in Ã¢ÂÂfacilitiesÃ¢ÂÂ so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.

Ã¢ÂÂOur concern is that the programÃ¢ÂÂs real intent is to interrogate the kids,Ã¢ÂÂ said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are Ã¢ÂÂoften questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.Ã¢ÂÂ While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyerÃ¢ÂÂs written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relativeÃ¢ÂÂs son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.

But the program was a surprise to Mexico

Ã¢ÂÂThe moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasnÃ¢ÂÂt an announcement,Ã¢ÂÂ said Reyna Torres MendÃÂ­vil, director general of the Mexican Foreign MinistryÃ¢ÂÂs office for protection of Mexicans abroad. Ã¢ÂÂWhere were they taking these children?Ã¢ÂÂ

Regarding preventing kids from becoming repeat offenders, the Juvenile Referral Process worked, But why is it okay to incarcerate kids based on a belief without a judge or knowledge of their parents? The only reason I can think of is that a program to detain kids is okay under a Democratic Party president, but preventing kids from going to jail with their parents is considered unAmerican when the president is a Republican.

Below is a video of an Illegal Immigrant child detention center published in July 2014.

Ã¯Â»Â¿

Note: The picture in the post may or may not be of the Mexican children discussed above. Based on the Washington Post we know that the detention center in McAllen, TX was one of the locations used and July 2014 is during the active period of the Juvenile Referral Process.

CNN Live Event/Special

Republican Presidential Debate

Aired June 05, 2007 - 19:00 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



WOLF BLITZER, HOST: Let's begin our questioning.

Right now Tom Fahey of the New Hampshire Union Leader with the first question.



TOM FAHEY, NEW HAMPSHIRE UNION LEADER: Thanks, Wolf.



Governor Romney, I wanted to start by asking you a question on which every American has formed an opinion.



We have lost 3,400 troops, civilian casualties are even higher, and the Iraqi government does not appear ready to provide for the security of its own country. Knowing everything you know right now, was it a mistake for us to invade Iraq?



MITT ROMNEY, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS: Well, the question is, kind of, a non sequitur, if you will. What I mean by that -- or a null set -- that is that if you're saying let's turn back the clock and Saddam Hussein had opening up his country to IAEA inspectors and they'd come in and they'd found that there were no weapons of mass destruction, had Saddam Hussein therefore not violated United Nations resolutions, we wouldn't be in the conflict we're in.



But he didn't do those things, and we knew what we knew at the point we made the decision to get in.



I supported the president's decision based on what we knew at that time.



I think we were underprepared and underplanned for what came after we knocked down Saddam Hussein.



By the way, Harry Reid was wrong. We did not lose the war in Iraq. And that's not the sort of thing you say when you have men and women in harm's way.



We did, however, not do a great job after we knocked down Saddam Hussein and won the war to take him down and his military.



And at this stage, the right thing for us to do is to see if we could possibly stabilize the central government in Iraq so that they can have stability, and so we can bring our troops home as soon as possible.



Not to do that adds an enormous potential risk that the whole region could be embroiled in a regional conflict. BLITZER: Governor, thank you, but the question was, knowing what you know right now -- not what you knew then, what you know right now -- was it a mistake for the United States to invade Iraq?



ROMNEY: Well, I answered the question by saying it's a non- sequitur. It's a non -- null set kind of question, because you can go back and say, ""If we knew then what we know now, by virtue of inspectors having been let in and giving us that information, by virtue of if Saddam Hussein had followed the U.N. resolutions, we wouldn't be having this discussion.""



So it's a hypothetical that I think is an unreasonable hypothetical.



And the answer is: We did what we did. We did the right thing based on what we knew at that time. I think we made mistakes following the conduct or the collapse of Saddam's government.



FAHEY: Mayor Giuliani, same question to you. Knowing what you know right now, was it a good decision?



RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: Absolutely the right thing to do. It's unthinkable that you would leave Saddam Hussein in charge of Iraq and be able to fight the war on terror.



And the problem is that we see Iraq in a vacuum. Iraq should not be seen in a vacuum. Iraq is part of the overall terrorist war against the United States.



The problem the Democrats make is they're in denial. That's why you hear things like you heard in the debate the other night, that, you know, Iran really isn't dangerous; it's 10 years away from nuclear weapons.



Iran is not 10 years away from nuclear weapons. And the danger to us is not just missiles. The danger to us is a state like Iran handing nuclear weapons over to terrorists.



So it has to be seen in that light. And we have to be successful in Iraq.



BLITZER: Senator McCain, arguably going to war is the most important decision a member of the Senate can make.



Did you read the national intelligence estimate, which included all the caveats on whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?



SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: I did not read that particular document. I received hundreds of briefing, tens and hundreds of hours of study and background and information on it. And the fact is that the sanctions were breaking down. The sanctions were not going to hold. We had a multi-billion dollar scandal in the form of oil for food.



The fact is that Saddam Hussein had used weapons of mass destruction before on his own people and on his enemies. And if he'd gotten them again, he'd have used them again. That was his commitment and his belief, that he was going to. And we did the right thing.



The problem was the mismanagement of the conflict.



BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.



Senator Brownback, you're also a member of the United States Senate. Did you read that classified national intelligence estimate?



SEN. SAM BROWNBACK (R), KANSAS: I don't remember that report. I had a number of briefings and I held a number of committee hearings. At that time, I was chairing the Middle East Subcommittee on Foreign Relations. And we held hearings on this topic and what was taking place and what Saddam was doing.



But the issue is that we've got to put forward, now, a political plan. And that's something I'm going to introduce tomorrow, a political plan to create a three-state solution in Iraq: a Kurdish state, a Sunni state, a Shia state. Because Iraq is more three groups held together by exterior forces. And that's what we've lacked is a political plan to get us moving forward in success.



BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.



Governor Gilmore, let me go to you. You chaired this commission. Do you think it was appropriate that members of Congress would authorize the president to go to war without reading that national intelligence estimate?



JIM GILMORE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA: You know, I think the people who are in Congress who are responsible for sending this country to war, with the enormous dangers that it has geopolitically and strategically, ought to read at least that kind of material. I know they get a lot of stuff and they can't read everything.



But you know what, Wolf? I think the true business is this: The interests of the United States is in creating as much stability as possible in the Middle East. There is a very great danger to this country: our interests in Israel, our interests in energy and in other ways. There is a giant danger of the Middle East becoming an unstable place.



Saddam Hussein was unstable, and so taking him out was good there. But we certainly didn't anticipate the further instability that was to come after.



BLITZER: We're going to bring all of you in, but I want to go to Scott Spradling of WMUR for the next question.



SCOTT SPRADLING, WMUR-TV: Thanks, Wolf.



Senator McCain, we've just spent a few minutes looking back. I'd ask you to look forward now, if you will.



Since June 1st there have been at least 17 confirmed deaths of American soldiers in Iraq. Approximately 100 U.S. troops are dying there every month. If our top military commander in Iraq, General Petraeus, reports back to Congress this September that the surge hasn't significantly improved the situation on the ground, what then?



MCCAIN: Well, let me say, first of all, I know how frustrated and saddened all Americans are. This morning I was with the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfeboro, who sacrificed his life. And our hearts and our sympathy goes out to all those who have sacrificed their lives in this conflict.



I (inaudible) think this strategy needs to be given a chance to succeed. We haven't barely gotten the fifth brigade over there, which is part of this strategy.



I am convinced that if we fail and we have to withdraw, they will follow us home. It will be a base for Al Qaida. And we will be facing greater challenges and greater sacrifices than that already made by Matthew Stanley and his family.



There is no doubt in my mind that this will become a base for terrorism, there will be chaos in the region. And when Senator Clinton says this is Mr. Bush's war, that this is President Bush's war -- when President Clinton was in power, I didn't say that Bosnia, our intervention there was President Clinton's war. When we intervened in Kosovo, I didn't say it was President Clinton's war.



What Senator Clinton doesn't understand that presidents don't lose wars. Political parties don't lose wars.



Nations lose wars, and nations lose the -- have the consequences of failure.



BLITZER: Senator...



MCCAIN: We must succeed in this conflict.



BLITZER: ... the question was, if General Petraeus says...



(APPLAUSE)



... it's not working so far in September, what do you do then?



MCCAIN: Then you have to examine the options.



And I'll tell you the options: One is the division that Sam described. You would have to divide bedrooms in Baghdad because Sunni and Shia are married to each other. You have 2 million Sunni and 4 million Shia living in Baghdad together.



You would have to -- you withdraw to the borders and watch genocide take place inside Baghdad. You watch the destabilization of Jordan. You see further jeopardy of Israel because of the threats of Hezbollah and Iranian hegemony in the region.



All of the options I could run through with you. My friend, none of them are good. That's why we must succeed and give it a chance to succeed.



BLITZER: All right.



Now, let me bring in Governor Thompson.



Go ahead, same question to you: If General Petraeus says it's not working in September, what should the U.S. do then?



TOMMY THOMPSON, FORMER HHS SECRETARY: The first thing the president should do is demand the al-Maliki government to vote as to whether or not they want the United States to stay in Iraq. We've been there four years. Give the government the responsibility of voting.



If they vote ""yes,"" how are they going to help us win this war? If they vote ""no,"" we should redeploy our forces outside.



Secondly, there are 18 territories in Iraq, geographically defined. Those 18 territories, just like 50 states in America, should elect their state leaders. And if they do so, the Shiites will elect Shiites, Sunnis will elect Sunnis, Kurds will elect Kurds. And you know something? People will go to those particular territories, and you get rid of this civil war internecine.



Number three...



BLITZER: All right...



THOMPSON: ... I would like to have the oil revenue proceeds -- very quickly -- oil revenue proceeds split: one-third to the federal government, one-third to the states, and one-third to every man, woman and child. And that will get everybody a stake in their country.



BLITZER: Let me bring in Congressman Duncan Hunter.



Congressman, if it's not working at that point, how much longer should the United States stay?



REP. DUNCAN HUNTER (R), CALIFORNIA: Well, Wolf, you know, I read that NIE report, and I held briefings before we made the vote to go in and invited everybody, Democrat and Republican, to get the classified information.



And this depends -- the turnover of the security apparatus depends on one thing: reliable Iraqi forces.



You've got 129 Iraqi battalions. We've trained them up. We've got a lot of them in the fight. Over the next three to four months, we need to get them all in the fight, get them that combat capability. When they're combat-hardened, we rotate them in, we displace American heavy combat forces off that battlefield, and Americans come home. And, Wolf...



BLITZER: Thank you.



HUNTER: ... I can tell you, as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for the last four years, I have the credentials to leave Iraq the right way.



BLITZER: Congressman Ron Paul, how much longer should the United States stay in Iraq?



REP. RON PAUL (R), TEXAS: The sooner we come home, the better. If they declare there's no progress in September, we should come home. It was a mistake to go, so it's a mistake to stay.



If we made the wrong diagnosis, we should change the treatment. So we're not making progress there and we should come home.



The weapons weren't there and we went in under U.N. resolutions. And our national security was not threatened. We're more threatened now by staying.



BLITZER: Governor Huckabee, do you have confidence in the government of Iraq...



(APPLAUSE)



... the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, that he's going to do what needs to be done?



MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: I think there's some real doubt about that, Wolf.



But I want to remind all of us on this stage and the people in the audience that there's a reason that this is such a struggle. And I think we miss it over here in the West.



Today's the birthday of Ronald Reagan. We all would believe that Ronald Reagan is the one who ended the Cold War and Ronald Reagan is the one who helped bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union.



But there's a group of people who don't believe that, and that's the Taliban. They believe they brought about the demise of the Soviet Union because of the way they fought in Afghanistan.



And what I want to just mention is that it is not the size of the dog in the fight, it is the size of the fight in the dog. And we underestimate -- grossly underestimate how fierce this dog is and how determined they are to destroy every last one of us.



BLITZER: All right.



Congressman Tom Tancredo, what do you say?



REP. TOM TANCREDO (R), COLORADO: I'll tell you this, that if it comes to that point in that time that you described, that the surge is apparent that it is not working, I did support it. I hope to God it does work. I hope I'm wrong. I hope we pacify Iraq.



However, if it is apparent that we cannot, then we have to do and tell the Iraqis the exact same thing that Benjamin Franklin said when he came out of the convention in 1787 and somebody said to him, ""Dr. Franklin, what have you given us?"" And he said, ""A republic, if you can keep it.""



It is exactly that time and it is exactly that thing that we have to say to the Iraqi government: ""We have given you this. We bought it with our blood and sweat. It is now up to you to keep it.""



And I want the Iraqis to be in fact patrolling Baghdad. If they need vehicles, you let them have the vehicles. But I want them patrolling their city and putting their lives at risk.



Then we move out.



BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.



(APPLAUSE)



I want to go to the next question. I want to go back to Tom.



Tom, go ahead.



FAHEY: Senator Brownback, President Bush has stated that states that sponsor terrorism are no different than terrorists themselves. Yet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recently met with Iranian officials to discuss security in Iraq. Iran is a known support of Hezbollah, Hamas.



Did President Bush make the right call in opening a dialogue with Iran?



BROWNBACK: I think he made a right call on saying that about terrorist states, particularly Iran. But I think we have to at times talk with them in different situations.



Like, before we went into Afghanistan, we talked with Iran. It wasn't we were negotiating. We didn't open up formal diplomatic relations and we shouldn't.



Iran is the lead sponsor of terrorism. Ahmadinejad just this past week called for the destruction of Israel, continues to call for attacking of the United States.



On Iraq, I think we need to talk with them. I think we have to confront them aggressively for what they are, which is the lead sponsor of terrorism in the world. I think we need to push the sanctions forward more aggressively. I think we need to work with the labor union movement that's developing inside of Iran. You had a bus driver strike that recently took place.



And I think we have to show that purpose and resolve, that we're going to confront these guys and we're going to stand with our allies like Israel, we're going to stand against them oppressing and pushing us, and trying to fund terrorists against us.



BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.



Congressman Hunter, let me bring...



BROWNBACK: Senator, if you don't mind.



BLITZER: Excuse me, Senator.



BROWNBACK: That's OK.



BLITZER: Congressman Hunter, let me bring you back in. Do you agree with Senator Brownback that President Bush made the right decision in opening a direct dialogue with Iran?



HUNTER: With two conditions. And I think that you do have a dialogue with everybody, whether they're adversaries or friends.



The two conditions are: Number one, they are moving deadly equipment across the border that is killing Americans in Iraq.



We have license to utilize anything that we want to use: special operations, intelligence, whatever it takes to stop that deadly equipment from moving across the border and hitting Americans in Iraq. And we don't give that up with these talks.



Secondly, they've got about 1,000 centrifuges now working, enriching the material that can make, at some point, a nuclear device. The United States reserves the right to preempt, and we may have to preempt that nuclear weapons program. We cannot allow them to have a nuclear device.



With those two caveats, talk to your enemies.



BLITZER: If it came down to a preemptive U.S. strike against Iran's nuclear facility if necessary, would you authorize as president the use of tactical nuclear weapons?



HUNTER: I would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons if there was no other way to preempt those particular centrifuges.



When the Osirak reactor was hit in '86, when the six F-18s came over the horizon and knocked that out, they didn't need anything but conventional weapons.



Probably it's going to take a little more than that. I don't think it's going to take tactical nukes.



BLITZER: What do you think, Mayor? Do you think, if you were president of the United States and it came down to Iran having a nuclear bomb, which you say is unacceptable, you would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons?



GIULIANI: Part of the premise of talking to Iran has to be that they have to know very clearly that it is unacceptable to the United States that they have nuclear power. I think it could be done with conventional weapons, but you can't rule out anything and you shouldn't take any option off the table.



And during the debate the other night, the Democrats seemed to be back in the 1990s. They don't seem to have gotten beyond the Cold War. Iran is a threat, a nuclear threat, not just because they can deliver a nuclear warhead with missiles. They're a nuclear threat because they are the biggest state sponsor of terrorism and they can hand nuclear materials to terrorists.



And we just saw it just last week in New York, an attempt by Islamist terrorists to attack JFK airport; three weeks ago, an attempt to attack Fort Dix.



These are real problems. This war is not a bumper sticker. This war is a real war.



BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.



(APPLAUSE)



BLITZER: Let me bring Governor Gilmore in.



What do you say about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons if that's what it takes to go deep underground and destroy those Iraqi facilities?



GILMORE: One of the central problems of the Middle East is the desire for Iran to dominate that portion of the world, because of what they are doing. And that is why I believe that they are seeking this kind of nuclear capacity. That is one of the reasons why we are, in fact, in Iraq.



And that's why our soldiers, when they fight and die there, are in fact serving the interests of the United States. Nobody ought to have any doubt about that.



With respect to Iran, the policy I would follow would be dual.



Number one, we need to work with our European allies in order to put in appropriate sanctions. We need to communicate directly with the Iranians that we are going to offer them an opportunity to work with us.



But we are also going to say that having a nuclear weapon is unacceptable; they need to understand it. And all options are on the table by the United States in that instance.



BLITZER: All right. Thank you, Governor.



Governor Romney, I want to get you on the record. Do you agree with the mayor, the governor, others here, that the use of tactical nuclear weapons, potentially, would be possible if that were the only way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb?



ROMNEY: You don't take options off the table, but what you do is stand back and say, ""What's going on here?"" You see what's happening in Sudan and Afghanistan, in Iraq and Iran. All over the world, we're seeing the same thing happening, and that is people are testing the United States of America. And we have to make sure they understand that we're not arrogant; we have resolve. And we have the strength to protect our interests and to protect people who love liberty.



For that to happen, we're going to have to not just attack each one of these problems one by one, but say, how do we help move the world of Islam so that the moderate Muslims can reject the extreme?



And for that to happen, we're going to have to have a strong military and an effort to combine with our allies in such a way, we combine for an effort to help move Islam toward modernity.



That's what we're going to have to do, instead of looking at each theater one by one and saying, ""We'll bomb here, we'll attack here, we'll go to Sudan.""



I watched the Democrats...



BLITZER: Thank you.



ROMNEY: ... they don't think there's a war on terror.



BLITZER: Thank you.



ROMNEY: There's a war going on, and we need a broad response to make sure that these people have a different vision.



(APPLAUSE)



BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.



All of you are going to have an opportunity to weigh on all of these questions as well.



If you're hearing some sounds out there, it's lightning here in Manchester, New Hampshire. Those are the crackling sounds that you're hearing.



Let's go back to Scott.



SPRADLING: Thanks, Wolf.



Congressman Tancredo, let's talk immigration.



TANCREDO: OK.



SPRADLING: You oppose the immigration reform compromise, calling it, quote, ""the worst piece of legislation to come down the pike in a long time."" Just this morning in Manchester, you vowed to oust any senator who supports the bill, including possibly New Hampshire's senior Senator Judd Gregg, who's undecided, and says to your comments that you are part of the know-nothing wing of the political spectrum.



In the meantime, the president says his plan is the last best chance for serious immigration reform.



He's criticized conservatives for being obstructionists.



With that tension at stake, if this becomes law, what are the consequences for the country?



TANCREDO: They are incredible, and they are disastrous.



And that is exactly why I have said what I've said, and that is why I have consistently tried to impress upon the American public the seriousness of this issue.



We're not just talking about the number of jobs that we may be losing or the number of kids that are in our schools and impacting our school system or the number of people that are abusing our hospital system and taking advantage of the welfare system in this country. We're not just talking about that.



We're talking about something that goes to the very heart of this nation: whether or not we will actually survive as a nation.



And here's what I mean by that.



What we're doing here in this immigration battle is testing our willingness to actually hold together as a nation or split apart into a lot of balkanized pieces.



We are testing our willingness to actually hold on to something called the English language, something that is the glue that is supposed to hold us together as a nation.



We are becoming a bilingual nation. And that is not good.



And that is the fearful part of this. The ramifications are much, much more significant than any that we've been discussing so far.



And so, yes, I have said dramatic things. And, yes, I am willing to do whatever is necessary to try to stop this piece of legislation. And that includes go after any Republican that votes for it, because the Republicans can stop this.



BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Congressman.



(APPLAUSE)



Mayor Giuliani, what do you think the consequences for the nation are if this immigration plan proposed by President Bush goes through?



GIULIANI: The problem with this immigration plan is it has no real unifying purpose. It's a typical Washington mess. It's everybody compromises -- four or five compromises.



And the compromises leave you with the following conclusion: The litmus test you should have for legislation is, is it going to make things better? And when you look at these compromises, it is quite possible it will make things worse. The organizing purpose should be that our immigration laws should allow us to identify everyone who is in this country that comes here from a foreign country.



They should have a tamper-proof I.D. card. It should be in a database that allows you to figure out who they are, why they're here, make sure they're not illegal immigrants coming here for a bad purpose, and then to be able to throw out the ones who are not in that database.



We can do that. Credit card companies...



BLITZER: Thank you.



GIULIANI: ... take care of data that is greater than that.



BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.



I want to get to Senator McCain in a moment, but first, Governor Romney, Senator McCain has accused you of flip-flopping on this issue, in effect.



Yesterday in Miami, he said the following: ""Pandering for votes on this issue while offering no solution to the problem amounts to doing nothing. And doing nothing is silent amnesty.""



What do you say to Senator McCain?



ROMNEY: Well, he's my friend. He campaigned for me two times. I consider him a friend. I'm not going to make this a matter of personal politics. It's an issue that's way too important for that.



My view is that we should enforce our immigration laws.



And this bill, unfortunately, has at least one provision that's a real problem. It's the Z visa.



And what it allows is people who have come here illegally to stay here for the rest of their lives -- not necessarily as citizens; they have to wait 13 years to become citizens. That's not the point.



The point is: Every illegal alien, almost every one, under this bill, gets to stay here. That's not fair to the millions and millions of people around the world that would love to come here, join with family members, bring skill and education that we need.



It's simply not fair to say those people get put ahead in the line of all the people who've been waiting legally to come to this country.



(APPLAUSE)



BLITZER: All right, Senator McCain, this is your chance. I'd like you to respond as someone who is the co-author of this legislation.



MCCAIN: Well, first of all, I agree with Judd Gregg. He's a great senator.



(APPLAUSE)



Second of all, Rudy, you just described our legislation, so I'd be glad to have further conversation with you, because it does account for people who are here illegally.



It does have an employment verification system. And it weeds out those who shouldn't be here, and it gives others a chance to remain in this country.



Look, this is a national security issue, first and foremost. Ever since 9/11, it's a national security issue.



People came to Fort Dix, New Jersey, from across our southern border and tried to kill our soldiers.



For us to do nothing is silent and de facto amnesty.



What we have done is what you expect us to do, my friends, and that's come together with the president of the United States, the leader of our party, Democrat and Republican, conservative Republicans like Jon Kyl, Johnny Isakson, Saxby Chambliss and Trent Lott, and sit down and figure out an approach to this problem.



And it is a serious national security problem.



We need to act, my friends. And if someone else has a better idea, I'd love to have them pursue -- give it to us.



BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.



(LAUGHTER)



(APPLAUSE)



Hold on.



MCCAIN: That can get...



BLITZER: Senator...



(CROSSTALK)



AUDIENCE MEMBER: ... a better idea!



MCCAIN: That will get the support of enough people so that we can pass legislation.



This isn't the bill that I would have written, but it does...



BLITZER: All right. Thank you.



MCCAIN: ... it does satisfy our national security challenges, which are severe and intense. And we cannot 12 million people washing around America illegally, my friends. (CROSSTALK)



MCCAIN: And I hope you'll examine the legislation.



BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.



MCCAIN: And I hope we can move forward with it. And we can make it better.



BLITZER: All right.



MCCAIN: But it's our job to do the hard things...



BLITZER: Mayor, go ahead.



MCCAIN: ... not the easy things.



(APPLAUSE)



GIULIANI: I've read the 400 pages. And this is part of the problem in Washington: They say things and then it's not in the legislation.



There are four or five different methods of identification, not one.



It does not provide information about who exited the United States. Now, tell me how you're going to figure out who's in the United States if you can't figure out who's left the United States.



And finally, it doesn't provide for a uniform database. Many countries have this. The United States doesn't have it.



On September 11th, when we tried to figure out who was in this country, it took weeks to figure out who were the right people and who weren't, because there isn't such a database. And that is a fatal flaw in this legislation. And wishing it away doesn't make it possible.



(APPLAUSE)



BLITZER: Governor Romney, what would you do with the 12 million or so illegal immigrants who are, right now, in this country?



ROMNEY: Well, one is to enforce the law as it exists. The law that was passed in 1986...



(APPLAUSE)



The law passed in 1986 asked for us to secure the border and said also to put in place an employment verification system.



Neither one of those was done. So let's make sure that we enforce the law as it exists.



And if you want to improve this bill, well, one thing you could do to make it better is to take that Z visa and make it temporary instead of a permanent right to stay in America. That's simply just not fair.



(APPLAUSE)



BLITZER: I want to stay on immigration. Everybody's going to have a chance to weigh in. But let's go back to Tom for another question on immigration.



FAHEY: Congressman Hunter, whether we like it or not, in cities across America, counties across America, including your district in San Diego, illegal immigrants are doing jobs that American citizens don't want, working on farms, in hotels, restaurants.



If you have your way and they all leave this country, who's going to fill those jobs?



HUNTER: Well, first, I disagree with that premise, because when they made the sweep on the Swift plants -- those were the meat- packaging plants in Iowa; took out some 850 people who were working there illegally several months ago -- there were American citizens lined up the next day to get their jobs back at 18 bucks an hour.



And let me tell you, this is a disastrous bill. And John McCain is right in saying that this is a national security issue. And it is: border enforcement.



Then the Hunter bill, which was signed by the president on the 26th of October, mandating 854 miles of double fence -- not that scraggly, little fence you show on CNN all the time, Wolf, that people get across so easily.



If they get across my fence, we sign them up for the Olympics immediately.



(LAUGHTER)



We've got a big fence.



But 854 miles of double border fence was mandated to be constructed. Homeland Security has a billion bucks, cash on hand. It's been six months, and they've done 11 miles.



So this administration has a case of the slows. And I think they slowed the fence down so that they could come out with the amnesty at the same time, put the two together, and the Bush-McCain-Kennedy bill would then be accepted by conservatives and liberals alike.



It's a bad bill.



BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.



(APPLAUSE)



Senator Brownback, what do you say about this notion of a pathway toward citizenship for these 12 million illegal immigrants who are in the country right now? Under what circumstances would you let them begin that path?



BROWNBACK: I don't think you create any new paths to citizenship. But I also think you allow them to be able to use paths that they would currently qualify for, and to be able to get in the back of "	0

Sen. Hillary Clinton, Sen. Barack Obama and former Sen. John Edwards answered questions from CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Joe Johns and Suzanne Malveaux in a debate sponsored by CNN and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, Monday night.

Hillary Clinton, left, Barack Obama, center, and John Edwards answer questions on Monday night.

JOE JOHNS, CNN: Senator Clinton, good evening.

The number-one issue for Americans of both parties is the economy, and today the news is simply not good. Markets around the world are in a tailspin because of fears of a U.S. recession. So far this year, the Dow has lost nearly 9 percent.

How much money would your stimulus plan put in the pockets of the average South Carolinian?

SEN. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, Joe, I'm glad you started with the economy, because that is the number-one issue. What's been happening in the markets, what's been happening with the home mortgage crisis, $100-a- barrel oil, so many of the issues that are really at the kitchen tables of Americans today and what they're talking to me about.

We have to stimulate the economy. I began calling for some kind of economic action plan back at the beginning of December. I have a package of $110 billion; $70 billion of that would go towards dealing with the mortgage crisis, which, unfortunately, I don't think that President Bush has really taken seriously enough.

I would have a moratorium on home foreclosures for 90 days to try to help families work it out so that they don't lose their homes. We're in danger of seeing millions of Americans become basically, you know, homeless and losing the American dream.

I want to have an interest rate freeze for five years, because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, the problem will just get compounded. And we need more transparency in the market.

Then, I think we need to give people about $650, if they qualify -- which will be millions of people -- to help pay their energy bills this winter. You know, there are so many people on fixed incomes and working people who are not going to be able to afford the spike in energy costs.

We need to make sure that we start jumpstarting the jobs in this country again. That's why I want to put money into clean energy jobs, green-collar jobs, and also make sure we have a fund that will help communities deal with the consequences of the home foreclosure crisis and make sure the unemployment system is up to the task.

And then we will have money for rebates, but let's make them the right rebates. Everything we know about President Bush's plans would leave 50 million to 70 million Americans out, because a lot of our seniors on fixed incomes don't pay income taxes. But that doesn't mean they're immune from the energy costs and the health care costs and everything else that's going up around them.

And we have a huge number of working people who thankfully don't pay income tax. They pay payroll tax. They pay a lot of other taxes. President Bush's plan would do nothing to help them.

But thankfully we've got leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus here who are going to make sure that we get the right kind of stimulus. And that's what the Democrats are going to support.

It's imperative we do it. It's a part of economic justice, which on Dr. King's holiday is part of his unfinished legacy.

WOLF BLITZER, CNN: All right.

Senator Obama?

(APPLAUSE)

SEN. BARACK OBAMA: Well, we do meet on the King holiday. And I think it's important to remember that, in the march on Washington, where Dr. King always talks about -- or it's always repeated, the dream speech that is so famous -- that march was for jobs, as well as justice.

And, unfortunately, we have not made the kind of progress that we need in having a balanced economy, and George Bush has made it worse.

George Bush has consistently skewed our tax code to the wealthy. He has squandered billions of dollars in a war that I believe should never have been authorized and should have never been waged.

(APPLAUSE)

We have not made the investments that are needed in our school system. You travel around South Carolina along the corridor of shame, and you've got children who are going to schools that were built in the 1800s. And they are not able to compete in an international economy.

So it is absolutely critical right now to give a stimulus to the economy. And Senator Clinton mentioned tax rebates. That wasn't the original focus of her plan. I think recently she has caught up with what I had originally said, which is we've got to get taxes into the -- tax cuts into the pockets of hard-working Americans right away.

And it is important for us to make sure that they are not just going to the wealthy. They should be going to folks who are making $75,000 a year or less, and they should be going to folks who only pay payroll tax, but typically are not paying income tax.

If we do that, then not only can we stimulate the economy, those are the folks who are most likely to spend money right away.

BLITZER: Do you agree with her, $650 is a good number for a tax rebate?

OBAMA: Well, I think that we are going to have to get some immediate money. What I do is I say, for a typical family, $500 for a tax rebate per family.

But also, for senior citizens, get a supplement to their Social Security check, because they get that every month. We know exactly how to do it. And that would provide seniors all across the country right away some money to help pay for their heating bills and other expenses that they've got right now.

BLITZER: Correct me if I'm wrong, Senator Edwards. Your plan does not call for a tax rebate, does it?

FORMER SEN. JOHN EDWARDS: No, that's exactly right. Can I start by saying how proud I am to be here tonight, a debate sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus on Dr. King's holiday?

And particularly on this night, when we're honoring the legacy of Dr. King, central to his work was the idea of fighting for real equality between the races, fighting to end poverty in America, his famous Poor People's Campaign, which he was engaged in at the time of his death, fighting for garbage workers, actually, in Memphis.

And the chasm between the rich and the poor in America is wide. It is getting worse. The rich are get richer. And we've added five million people to the poverty rolls in just over the course of the last seven years, which is...

BLITZER: But what about the stimulus package?

EDWARDS: Here's what we should do. That's why I'm getting to this. What Bush does is he leaves 50 million -- as Hillary pointed out -- 50 million Americans. They're low-income Americans and moderate-income Americans. They are completely left out of the stimulus package.

If we're actually going to deal with the legacy of Dr. King, if we're going to deal with this issue of poverty -- and I have a comprehensive plan to do that, it is the cause of my life, to end poverty in this country -- we also have to include all Americans in this stimulus plan.

Now, one difference between what I have proposed and what my two colleagues have proposed is I have done something that not only stimulates the economy, but creates long-term benefits, investment in green infrastructure, which creates jobs.

Instead of just getting money out in the short term, this will actually create jobs over the long term, create green infrastructure.

Yes, we need to do something about the mortgage crisis. I want to mention one last thing.

There is one other issue that was mentioned in passing by the two of them, which is the issue of jobs. And there is a difference between myself and my colleagues on this issue of jobs, because they both supported the Peru trade deal.

My view is the Peru trade deal was similar to NAFTA. And this is crucial to the state of South Carolina...

BLITZER: But...

EDWARDS: ... no, no -- and crucial to the state of the South Carolina and jobs in South Carolina. South Carolina has been devastated by NAFTA and trade deals like NAFTA.

BLITZER: I just want to be precise. What you're proposing are really long-term objectives. In terms of a short-term stimulus package, you disagree with them on an immediate tax rebate.

EDWARDS: No, no. What I'm saying is if we do what we should do to green the economy, if we change our unemployment insurance laws, modernize them to make them available to more people, to more Americans, if we in fact give help to the states, which gets money straight into the economy and we deal with the mortgage crisis in a serious way with a home rescue fund to provide transitional financing for those people who are about to lose their homes, all those things will stimulate the economy.

BLITZER: I'll let both of you respond, but let me let Senator Obama respond first.

(APPLAUSE)

OBAMA: Let me just respond to a couple of things. I think the idea of bringing jobs is important, which is why that's central to my energy plan. But, Wolf, you're exactly right, that is a long-term agenda. That is not going to deal with the immediate crisis we have right now.

You've got the European markets dropped 5 percent. The expectation is that the Dow Jones tomorrow may do the same. We could be sliding into an extraordinary recession unless we stimulate the economy immediately. That's point number one.

Point number two, on trade, John is exactly right that you travel around South Carolina and you see the textile mills that John's father worked in closed, all over the region. And it is absolutely true that NAFTA was a mistake.

I know that Hillary on occasion has said -- just last year said this was a boon to the economy. I think it has been devastating, because our trade agreements did not have labor standards and environmental standards that would assure that workers in the U.S. were getting a square deal.

But the only thing I want to differ on John is this whole notion of Peru. The Peru trade deal had labor and environmental agreements in it. Peru is an economy the size of New Hampshire. Over 90 percent of the goods coming from Peru already come in under various free trade agreements.

And, John, you voted for permanent trade relations with China, which I think anybody who looks at how we structure trade in this country would tell you has been the biggest beneficiary and the biggest problem that we have with respect to trade, particularly because they're still manipulating the currency.

BLITZER: I'll let you respond, but, Senator Clinton, I want to get back to the issue of an immediate stimulus for the economy.

CLINTON: That's what I want to get back to.

BLITZER: Because who knows what the markets are going to be like tomorrow and there are a lot of people out there who are suffering already. But go ahead and respond.

CLINTON: Well, I want to just clarify a couple of points. My original plan was $70 billion in spending with a $40 billion contingency that was part of the original plan, in order to have that money available for tax rebates.

I hope that we could do it through spending, and here's why: I don't want to necessarily open up the tax code while we've got Republicans in the Senate who are going to try to come back and open up making Bush's tax cuts permanent.

(APPLAUSE)

I understand that that's a real risk. So I was hoping to be able to do it through spending, but the crisis has gotten too deep, and what happened in the markets globally today is a huge wakeup call.

The president should convene the working group on financial markets. He should ask the secretary of treasury to do this immediately. I know that there's been talking going on, but the president's proposed stimulus package is not adequate. It is too little too late and it doesn't give enough money to the people who are hardest hit by the increased costs in energy and everything else.

(APPLAUSE)

As a further point, I do believe that the green-collar job piece of this is important. That's why I have $5 billion to do it. There are programs already. Oakland, California, Mayor Dellums is working to have a green-collar job program. We could put hundreds and hundreds of young people to work right now, putting solar panels in, insulating homes.

That would give them jobs and it would move us more quickly to a green economy. And I think that if you look at this from a jobs and justice, a stimulation and long-term planning effort, we need to lay down the markers now. And that's why the Congress, under the leadership of a lot of the people who are chairs of committees and subcommittees who are here today are going to play a major role in this. And we've got to hold the line against President Bush with his ill-advised approach to stimulating the economy.

BLITZER: All right. We're staying on topic. We're staying on this subject, but I want to ask Suzanne Malveaux to ask a question and then all of you will be able to weigh...

EDWARDS: You have to give me a chance to respond to Senator Obama.

BLITZER: All right, go ahead, respond quickly and then Suzanne.

EDWARDS: Thank you.

Well, first of all, what I have proposed for green-collar jobs will create jobs within 30 or so days, so we will have an immediate impact on the economy and stimulate the economy. Second, no one has to explain to me what these trade deals have done to South Carolina, to North Carolina. My father, who's sitting right out there in the audience, worked in the mills for 36 years and we have seen what these trade deals have done to people who have worked hard all their lives.

EDWARDS: And the problem with Peru, Barack, is you are leaving the enforcement of environmental and labor regulations in the hands of George Bush.

I wouldn't trust George Bush to enforce anything, certainly no trade obligations.

(APPLAUSE)

BLITZER: All right. Ten seconds, go ahead.

(APPLAUSE)

OBAMA: Well, the only point I would make is that in a year's time, it'll be me who's enforcing them.

(APPLAUSE)

And so we're going to make sure that the right thing is being done. And, John, you tell an extraordinarily powerful story. I mean, you understand what's happened with respect to trade here and I think it is powerful when you talk about it.

But keep in mind, I first moved to Chicago to be a community organizer with churches who were trying to deal with the devastation of steel plants that had closed in that region. And so I spent 3.5 years working alongside folks who had lost their jobs.

And I know what it's like for families to have put their life and their heart and soul into a company, building profits for shareholders, and then suddenly they had the rug pulled out from under them. Not only have they lost their job, they've lost their health care, they've lost their pension benefits.

And it is absolutely critical for us to understand that NAFTA was an enormous problem. The permanent trade relations with China, without some of the enforcement mechanisms that were in there, that you voted for, was also a significant problem.

And we've got to all move forward as Democrats to make sure that we've got trade deals that work for working people and not just for corporate profits.

BLITZER: All right. Suzanne Malveaux, go ahead.

(APPLAUSE)

SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN: I'd like to follow-up with Senator Obama. It was just a few days ago that Senator Clinton asserted that she was the strongest candidate when it comes to fiscal responsibility.

She says that the new programs that she proposes she essentially can pay for. She says that you have failed in that regard in the tune of some $50 billion worth of new programs that you cannot account for.

How do you respond to that charge?

OBAMA: What she said wasn't true. We account for every single dollar that we propose.

Now, this, I think, is one of the things that's happened during the course of this campaign, that there's a set of assertions made by Senator Clinton, as well as her husband, that are not factually accurate.

And I think that part of what the people are looking for right now is somebody who's going to solve problems and not resort to the same typical politics that we've seen in Washington.

(APPLAUSE)

That is something that I hear all across the country. So when Senator Clinton says -- or President Clinton says that I wasn't opposed to the war from the start or says it's a fairytale that I opposed the war, that is simply not true.

When Senator Clinton or President Clinton asserts that I said that the Republicans had had better economic policies since 1980, that is not the case.

Now, the viewers aren't concerned with this kind of back-and- forth. What they're concerned about is who's actually going to help the get health care, how are they going to get their kids...

(APPLAUSE)

... going to college, and that's the kind of campaign I've tried to run. I think that's the kind of campaign we should all try to run.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Well, I couldn't agree more. But I do think that your record and what you say does matter. And when it comes to...

(APPLAUSE)

... a lot of the issues that are important in this race, it is sometimes difficult to understand what Senator Obama has said, because as soon as he is confronted on it, he says that's not what he meant.

The facts are that he has said in the last week that he really liked the ideas of the Republicans over the last 10 to 15 years, and we can give you the exact quote.

Now, I personally think they had ideas, but they were bad ideas. They were bad ideas for America.

(APPLAUSE)

They were ideas like privatizing Social Security, like moving back from a balanced budget and a surplus to deficit and debt.

And with respect to putting forth how one would pay for all of the programs that we're proposing in this campaign, I will be more than happy, Barack, to get the information, because we have searched for it.

You have a lot of money that you want to put into foreign aid, a very worthy program. There is no evidence from your Web site, from your speeches, as to how you would pay for it.

Now, why is this important? It's important because I think elections are about the future. But how do you determine what will happen in the future? Well, you have to look to the record, you have to look to what we say in campaigns, and what we have done during our careers.

And I want to be just very explicit about this. We are not, neither my campaign nor anyone associated with it, are in any way saying you did not oppose the war in Iraq.

CLINTON: You did. You gave a great speech in 2002 opposing the war in Iraq. That was not what the point of our criticism was.

It was after having given that speech, by the next year the speech was off your Web site. By the next year, you were telling reporters that you agreed with President Bush in his conduct of the war. And by the next year, when you were in the Senate, you were voting to fund the war time after time after time.

BLITZER: All right.

CLINTON: So it was more about the distinction between words and action. And I think that is a fair assessment for voters to make.

(APPLAUSE)

BLITZER: OK. Thank you, Senator. Senator, we're a little off topic. I have to let Senator Obama respond, then Senator Edwards, who's going to come...

OBAMA: We're off topic, but...

BLITZER: But go ahead and respond, and then I want to get back to this issue that we're talking about, fiscal responsibility. But go ahead.

OBAMA: Let's talk about it.

Hillary, I will be happy to provide you with the information about all -- all the spending that we do. Now, let's talk about Ronald Reagan. What you just repeated here today is...

CLINTON: Barack...

OBAMA: Wait. No. Hillary, you just spoke.

CLINTON: I did not say anything about Ronald Reagan.

OBAMA: You just spoke for two minutes.

CLINTON: You said two things.

OBAMA: You just...

CLINTON: You talked about admiring Ronald Reagan and you talked about the ideas...

OBAMA: Hillary, I'm sorry. You just...

BLITZER: Senator...

CLINTON: I didn't talk about Reagan.

OBAMA: Hillary, we just had the tape. You just said that I complimented the Republican ideas. That is not true.

What I said -- and I will provide you with a quote -- what I said was is that Ronald Reagan was a transformative political figure because he was able to get Democrats to vote against their economic interests to form a majority to push through their agenda, an agenda that I objected to. Because while I was working on those streets watching those folks see their jobs shift overseas, you were a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart.

(APPLAUSE)

OBAMA: I was fighting these fights. I was fighting these fights. So -- but I want to be clear.

So I want to be clear. What I said had nothing to do with their policies. I spent a lifetime fighting a lifetime against Ronald Reagan's policies. But what I did say is that we have to be thinking in the same transformative way about our Democratic agenda.

We've got to appeal to Independents and Republicans in order to build a working majority to move an agenda forward. That is what I said.

(APPLAUSE)

OBAMA: Now, you can dispute that, but let me finish.

Hillary, you went on for two minutes. Let me finish.

The irony of this is that you provided much more fulsome praise of Ronald Reagan in a book by Tom Brokaw that's being published right now, as did -- as did Bill Clinton in the past. So these are the kinds of political games that we are accustomed to.

CLINTON: Now, wait a minute.

Wolf, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just a minute.

BLITZER: Senator Edwards, let them wrap up. Then I'm going to come to you.

Yes?

CLINTON: I just want -- I just to clarify -- I want to clarify the record. Wait a minute.

EDWARDS: There's a third person in this debate.

BLITZER: Wait a minute, Senator Edwards. Hold on.

There has been a specific charge leveled against Hillary Clinton, so she can respond. Then I'll bring in Senator Edwards.

CLINTON: I just want to be sure...

OBAMA: Go ahead and address what you said about...

BLITZER: We have got a long time to. You'll have a good opportunity.

CLINTON: We're just getting warmed up.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Now, I just -- I just want to be clear about this. In an editorial board with the Reno newspaper, you said two different things, because I have read the transcript. You talked about Ronald Reagan being a transformative political leader. I did not mention his name.

OBAMA: Your husband did.

CLINTON: Well, I'm here. He's not. And...

OBAMA: OK. Well, I can't tell who I'm running against sometimes.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Well, you know, I think we both have very passionate and committed spouses who stand up for us. And I'm proud of that.

But you also talked about the Republicans having ideas over the last 10 to 15 years.

OBAMA: I didn't say they were good ones.

CLINTON: Well, you can read the context of it.

OBAMA: Well, I didn't say they were good ones.

CLINTON: Well, it certainly...

OBAMA: All right, Wolf.

CLINTON: It certainly came across in the way that it was presented, as though the Republicans had been standing up against the conventional wisdom with their ideas. I'm just reacting to the fact, yes, they did have ideas, and they were bad ideas.

OBAMA: I agree.

CLINTON: Bad for America, and I was fighting against those ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor, Resco, in his slum landlord business in inner city Chicago.

(APPLAUSE)

OBAMA: No, no, no.

BLITZER: Hold on one second. Hold on.

Senator Edwards -- Senator Edwards has been remarkably patient during this exchange. And I want him -- I don't know if you want to get involved in this, Senator Edwards.

EDWARDS: What I want to say first is, are there three people in this debate, not two?

(APPLAUSE)

EDWARDS: And I also want to know -- I also want to know on behalf of voters here in South Carolina, this kind of squabbling, how many children is this going to get health care? How many people are going to get an education from this? How many kids are going to be able to go to college because of this?

EDWARDS: We have got to understand -- you know, and I respect both of my fellow candidates -- but we have got to understand this is not about us personally. It is about...

(APPLAUSE)

... what we are trying to do for this country and what we believe in.

Now, fiscal responsibility, which I think was the question. It was a little hard to tell there at the end of that. But I think the question was about fiscal responsibility.

I have proposed, I think, the most aggressive, most progressive agenda of the three of us up here. And I was the first to come out with a universal health care plan, first to come out with a global warming plan, first -- and, to the best of my knowledge, only at this point -- to come out with a comprehensive, detailed plan to end poverty in America, since we are on Dr. King's day.

This is the cause of my life. Everything I have proposed, I have come up with a way to pay for it. And I've been very explicit about how it should be paid for, not abstract, not rhetoric, very, very explicit.

But I do have to say, in response to something Senator Clinton said just a minute ago, both Senator Obama and I have said Social Security needs a solution. And we have said we won't privatize, we won't cut benefits, we won't raise the retirement age. Same thing that Hillary has said.

But she has proposed nothing about how we're going to create revenue to keep Social Security alive and talked about fiscal responsibility. Here's the problem: If you don't have -- this is not complicated. The American people understand it. If you've got more money going out than is coming in, you're going to eventually run out of money.

And you've got to have a way to pay for it, which is why -- now, let me finish this. Lord knows you let them go on forever.

(APPLAUSE)

What I'm saying is we have to be consistent in what we're saying. I have said I think Hillary doesn't want to talk about raising taxes. Let's just be honest about that.

Barack and I have both said that you've got to do something about the cap on Social Security taxes, which is now capped at $97,000. It means if somebody is making $80,000 a year, every dime of their income is taxed for Social Security. But if you are making $50 million a year, only the first $97,000 is taxed.

That's not right. And people ought to be paying their Social Security taxes. But the American people deserve to know what we're going to do.

We can disagree. There's nothing wrong with that, so they can make an informed choice, but they at least deserve to know where they stand and what we'd do.

BLITZER: We're staying on the economy, but I want Joe Johns to ask another question so we can continue this dialogue.

JOHNS: All right. Well, Senator Edwards, let's dig a little deeper on the economic mess we're in currently.

In 2006, a study from the Center for Responsible Lending found that African-Americans are something like 30 percent more likely to be sold a subprime loan than white borrowers with similar credit histories and income.

The South Carolina NAACP said last month that the American dream for too many Americans, too many African-Americans is a national nightmare. The national NAACP has even filed a class-action lawsuit against 12 nationwide lenders.

So the bottom-line question really is: Do you believe that lenders have specifically targeted African-Americans? Is this subprime mess really also an issue of race?

EDWARDS: Yes, is the answer. I think they have targeted -- if they haven't been racially motivated, I don't know. There's no way for me to know what's inside their head.

But what they have done is they have targeted the lowest income, most vulnerable families. And anybody who's paying any attention to what's going on in America today understands, if you are African- American in this country today, you are likely to have a net worth of about 10 percent of what white families have.

This is not an accident. I mean, we can go put our heads against the wall and pretend that the past never happened, pretend that we didn't live through decades of slavery, followed by decades of segregation, followed by decades of discrimination, which is still going on today.

(APPLAUSE)

That history and that legacy has consequences. And the consequence has been that African-American families are more vulnerable. They're more vulnerable to payday lenders. They're more vulnerable to predatory lenders, which is why we desperately need a national law, which I have proposed, which would crack down on these predatory payday lenders.

It's not enough to do it state-by-state, because these predators just move from place to place to place.

I was in a neighborhood in Cleveland a few months ago, one-block radius, 38 houses under foreclosure, middle-class, African-American neighborhood. These people work. They put everything they had into their homes. And they were about to lose them because these predators have come into the neighborhood and taken everything they have.

So here are the solutions. Number one, we need a national predatory lending law. Number two, we've got to help low-income families save.

EDWARDS: They have nothing to fall back on. Many have no bank account. They don't deal with financial institutions. We need to teach financial literacy, we need to match what they're able to save so that they actually have something that they can fall back on in case they get in a place where they need more money.

(APPLAUSE)

BLITZER: All right. I want both Senator Clinton and Senator Obama to respond.

But, briefly, Senator Clinton, your proposal calls for a five- year moratorium on interest rates, 90-day moratorium on foreclosure, five year keeping those interest rates the same. Alan Greenspan suggested that we simply have to let this housing crisis exhaust itself. Trying to prevent the housing markets from going down merely prolongs the agony.

Does your plan, as he would seem to be suggesting, prolong the agony?

CLINTON: No. I think it helps to mitigate the agony. I mean, what I hear as I go in and out of people's homes and talk to so many who have already lost their homes, they're in foreclosure, they see these interest rates that are about to go up and they know they can't pay them, is that we take action now.

I've been calling for action since last March. When I first started calling for it, a lot of the same economists who now say don't do anything about it said, well, it won't be that bad. We'll be able to weather the crisis.

Well, the fact is, the mortgage crisis is not only destroying the dreams of Americans for home ownership, it is having a ripple effect across the world. So my moratorium for 90 days is a work-out. It's not a bailout. I want people to be able to see whether they can stay in their homes paying a rate that is affordable for them.

And the interest rate freeze is I think merited, because look at what's happening -- if you're a big bank that helped get us into this mess, you go borrow money from Abu Dhabi or somewhere. If you're a homeowner who has been at the bottom of this incredible scheme that was established, you're left holding the bag and you don't have the house anymore.

BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.

CLINTON: So I just disagree with those who say don't try to do anything to help the people who need the help right now.

BLITZER: Senator Obama.

OBAMA: I think that we need to help them. I think it is important to make sure that we're not helping out the speculators, but instead are helping out the homeowners who are actually living in their homes, who have the capacity to make the payments if they're not seeing a huge increase in their mortgage payments.

But understand this, this is not new. We have a history in this country of preying on low-income peoples because they don't have access to banks. The Community Reinvestment Act is oftentimes not enforced as it should be.

We've got to open up bank branches. We've got to give people access to financing so that they're not going to a payday loan operation.

I two years ago introduced a provision that would eliminate predatory lending, something that I had already helped to get passed at the state level. But it is important for us to understand that we've got to give ordinary working people access to financing. And it's important to understand that part of the reason that they are borrowing on their homes, they're borrowing on credit cards, is that the banks and financial institutions have dominated policy in Washington.

And this is an area where I've got a policy disagreement with Senator Clinton. Wh"	0
205	"Barton: Medicare Drug Program Drawing Participants by the Thousands WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, made the following statement today during the full committee hearing on the Administration's FY '07 Health Care Priorities: ""Good afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt today to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him testify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities. ""First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your assistance in developing the important reforms we put into place for the Medicaid program starting this year. As a former governor yourself, you understood and appreciated the need to improve this program. Through passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, we will sustain Medicaid for those people who most often need health care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a thriving economy instead of from a government welfare program. The reforms we adopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of financial collapse. I look forward to working with you to see that the governors get the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to the poor of their states. ""I want to briefly highlight at least some of the changes in the law that have not recently received the public attention that they deserve. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 115,000 disabled children covered by the Family Opportunity Act will receive improved health care services as a result of the recently passed Deficit Reduction Act. The new law will provide access to new home and community based care to 120,000 individuals; and it will facilitate 100,000 nursing home residents to return to their communities through the Administration's Money Follows the Person Demonstration. These are the true results of Medicaid reform - better access to better care for those who most need our assistance. ""There is still much to be done to improve long-term care service delivery and financing as well as to promote Medicaid managed care. I have received the administration's proposals regarding additional improvement to the Medicaid program and I look forward to working with you this year on them. ""This year the secretary and the administration also are required to administer the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Making this program succeed is a high priority of yours, and it is a high priority of this committee that I chair. ""Since it began, critics have tried to make patients believe that they are not smart enough to understand the new Medicare drug benefit, that it provides inadequate coverage, and that signing up isn't worth their time because it cannot save them any money. The critics are simply wrong. They were wrong when they complained about the Medicare prescription drug card. They were wrong when they said nobody would offer any insurance plans. And they are wrong now. ""Some sense political advantage in condemning the program and others can't bring themselves to admit that free markets actually work. Transparency and competition will drive down prices and provide lower costs to consumers. Even if the critics don't get it, Medicare beneficiaries certainly do. That is why over 3.6 million Medicare beneficiaries have already signed up for the new benefit. You told me earlier today that there are close to 24 million Americans that have been enrolled in the program, through one means or another, and enrollment is increasing at approximately 250,000 people per week. That sounds like a success story to me. If you add that to the fact that the premiums which we estimated at $37 a month is now down to an average $27 per month, that appears to me to be a successful program. ""This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. The committee will work closely with yourself and Dr. Mark McClellan at CMS to get problems noticed and solved. We will have the first of what will likely be several hearings on this topic on March 1, when Dr. McClellan will testify before the Health subcommittee. I expect that we ask him very direct questions about where the problems are and what CMS is doing to fix them. ""Another high priority for the committee will be the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and related programs. I want to restate my deep commitment to reauthorizing the NIH and would ask for the secretary's assistance in working out the technical details so that we can enact this long overdue legislation. In addition, the authorization for the Ryan White CARE Act has now lapsed. I believe that funding unauthorized programs is not a responsible practice, and I anticipate that the committee will work to reauthorize these programs this year. ""I also intend to work with you this year on ways to reform Medicare reimbursement, and particularly focus on physician payment reform. In order to preserve access to Medicare services for future generations, we must look at how we are spending our Medicare dollars today and what are the incentives are for our physician community to continue providing quality health care. ""Another top priority of the committee will be to work with you on the proposals outlined in the Administration's budget to provide consumers with greater access to comparative price and quality data about their health care providers. I could go on, but my time has expired."" ####"	0
206	"The Democrat Party is up to their usual dirty tricks as Republican senate candidate Roy Moore fights against their cheating ways in an effort to become AlabamaÃ¢ÂÂs next senator.

According to the Birmingham Press, polling officials caught what appears to be a Ã¢ÂÂvan full of illegalsÃ¢ÂÂ who traveled to at least 7 polling locations with fake identification to vote for MooreÃ¢ÂÂs opponent Doug Jones.

Ã¢ÂÂLaw enforcement stopped the vehicle at Santa Recto Middle School in Wilmington as 13 Hispanic men were seen piling into a van after voting,Ã¢ÂÂ the Santa Recto Observer reported Tuesday afternoon. Ã¢ÂÂThe same men were also seen in Smithfield, Birmingham, La Croix, and Mobile and were reported as suspicious by voting officials.Ã¢ÂÂ

Members of the State Election Integrity Board began investigating the group of men at around 9 a.m. and tracking them around the state. Police arrested 10 of the men and three were able to run to safety before police grabbed their friends. Investigators determined that the men were responsible for Ã¢ÂÂdozens of fake votesÃ¢ÂÂ around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak.

This is typical of Democrats: when even fake news about Moore Ã¢ÂÂmolestingÃ¢ÂÂ a young woman fail, they try to cheat. This is, of course, similar to a situation in California on Election Day 2016 when illegal aliens were busted trying to vote for Hillary Clinton.

All but one of the men were Ã¢ÂÂundocumentedÃ¢ÂÂ immigrants from Mexico, San Salmos, and Puerta Gorda. The last, Marcos Ramos, is a U.S. citizen and faces up to 13 years in prison for election fraud.

How many other dirty tricks will be exposed?"	1

209	"McCain renews attacks on Obama links to radical

MIAMI, Florida (AFP) Ã¢ÂÂ Republican John McCain renewed his attacks on Barack Obama's ties to a 1960s radical here Wednesday as he targeted voters in the key battleground state of Florida.

McCain, who has refrained from linking Obama to Bill Ayers during recent campaign speeches, went back on the offensive six days before the November 4 polls in an interview with a Spanish-language radio station in Miami.

""I think this whole issue of the relationship with Bill Ayers needs to be known by the American people,"" he told Radio Mambi. ""Senator Obama said it was just a guy in the neighborhood. We know much more than that.""

Ayers was a member of the ""Weathermen"" movement, classified by the FBI as a ""domestic terrorist organization,"" which carried out a series of attacks to protest the Vietnam War, including on the Pentagon and US Capitol.

Obama met Ayers early in his political career in 1995 but his campaign has said he has not spoken by phone or exchanged e-mail messages with him since Obama became US senator in 2005.

McCain went on to accuse the Los Angeles Times of refusing to publish a video it had obtained of Ayers attending an event with a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

""I don't care much about an old, washed-up unrepentant terrorist, and his wife who was on an FBI top 10 wanted list,"" McCain said.

""But we should know about their relationship, including apparently information that is held by the Los Angeles Times concerning an event that Mr Ayers attended with a PLO spokesman.""

McCain appeared to be referring to a Los Angeles Times article from April which said Obama knew and attended a farewell party for Rashid Khalidi, a former PLO spokesman, during his academic career in Chicago. The article makes no mention of Ayers's presence at the event.

""The Los Angeles Times refuses to make that videotape public. I'm not in the business of talking about media bias but what if there was a tape with John McCain with a neo-Nazi outfit being held by some media outlet?

""I think the treatment of the issue would be slightly different,"" he said, saying Ayers had a ""long relationship"" with Obama, who was eight years old when the Weathermen were waging their radical campaign.

""It's not that Barack Obama was eight years old when Mr Ayers was committing acts of terror, it's all about the long relationship on foundations, for his book and launching his political career in Mr Ayers living room,"" McCain said.

The interview was one of several given by the 72-year-old senator to local radio in Miami as he attempts to woo the influential Hispanic vote in Florida , a state he almost certainly must win in order to take the White House.

Later McCain took aim at recent comments by former Cuba president Fidel Castro, who had ridiculed the former pilot's low grades at naval academy.

""I notice in the past couple of days that Fidel has made his preferences known in the campaign and had some very unkind things to say about me,"" McCain said. ""My feelings are hurt.""

More than one million Cuban-Americans live in Florida, and McCain said he was acutely aware of the group's possible influence in the election race.

He attempted to tap into anti-Castro sentiment by vowing to ""restore freedom and democracy"" on the island, criticizing Obama for advocating a policy of diplomatic engagement.

""I think we all know that the Cuban-American vote can be vital to whether I win Florida or not,"" McCain said. ""So I do want to say again that we will never waver in our mission to restore freedom and democracy."	0
210	"David Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, knows what gunshots sound like: His father worked in law enforcement, and taught him about weapons and how to handle them. So when Hogg heard a Ã¢ÂÂpopÃ¢ÂÂ while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, he told his teacher it sounded strangely like a gunshot. But there had been a fire drill that very morning and talk of a Ã¢ÂÂCode RedÃ¢ÂÂ exercise to prepare for an active shooter. This must just be a surprise drill, he reasoned.

And then the fire alarm sounded. Dutifully acting on it, Hogg and other students tried to exit the building. A janitorÃ¢ÂÂHogg doesnÃ¢ÂÂt know his name but calls him an angelÃ¢ÂÂknew where the shots were coming from and sent the students back. Then a culinary arts teacher, Ashley Kurth, pulled Hogg and others inside, locked the door, and made them hide in a closet. Checking Twitter and Instagram, HoggÃ¢ÂÂwhoÃ¢ÂÂs an editor at the schoolÃ¢ÂÂs TV stationÃ¢ÂÂfound the news that the shooting was real and ongoing.

The shots continued for what felt like an eternity. Hogg considered the possibility that he would not live to see the end of the day.

Ã¢ÂÂWhile I was in there, I thought, Ã¢ÂÂWhat impact have I had? What will my story be if I die here?Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Hogg told TIME in the hours following the ordeal. Ã¢ÂÂAnd the only thing I could think of was, pull out my camera and try telling others. As a student journalist, as an aspiring journalist, thatÃ¢ÂÂs all I could think: Get other peopleÃ¢ÂÂs stories on tape. If we all die, the camera survives, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs how we get the message out there, about how we want change to be brought about.Ã¢ÂÂ

In the wake of WednesdayÃ¢ÂÂs mass shooting, in which at least 17 were killed and more than a dozen others wounded, that cry for change is echoing across this normally quiet, almost bucolic Florida community of 30,000 on the edge of the Everglades, which draws residents seeking sprawling homes and room to run horses. ItÃ¢ÂÂs being heard across Broward County, whose sheriff, Scott Israel, is prodding Florida officials to provide more funding for mental health, as well as laws that would prevent a person with psychological problems from being able to legally acquire a gun. And itÃ¢ÂÂs becoming a rallying cry for people here and across the U.S. who are wondering what, if anything, changes from one mass shooting to the next.

Ã¢ÂÂWhen do we say, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not acceptable, something has to change?Ã¢ÂÂ asked Hogg, 17, his voice breaking.

HoggÃ¢ÂÂs sister Lauren, a freshman at the high school, is fearing the worst: one of her friends had still not been located late Thursday. Nikolas Cruz, the suspect who has been charged with 17 counts of murder, had been expelled from the school a year ago and appears to have targeted a building full of ninth-graders.

RELATED VIDEO: Florida Shooting Survivor Calls for Action

Will Gilroy is one of the freshmen who escaped the gunmanÃ¢ÂÂs wrath. He is still waiting for word about classmates that havenÃ¢ÂÂt been located. Like Hogg, Gilroy thought the shooting wasnÃ¢ÂÂt real at first. But then he heard the sirens. He listened to his teacherÃ¢ÂÂs orders and crowded into a closet with about 20 others. He was in there, he says, for about an hour.

Ã¢ÂÂIt was hot in there. We were packed in tight,Ã¢ÂÂ he told TIME. Ã¢ÂÂSome students were crying. The teacher had paper plates and we used them to fan ourselves.Ã¢ÂÂ Inside the closet Gilroy began texting with his mother, Kristi Gilroy, who teaches second and third grade in at Country Hills Elementary just down the road. She too was on lockdown, with kids who stayed for after-school ccare. She was relieved to know her only son was alive. But the shooter was still at large. Cruz was eventually caught just down the road from their house, trying to escape with the rest of the crowd.

Ã¢ÂÂMy husband is ex-military, so itÃ¢ÂÂs not like weÃ¢ÂÂre anti-gun. But an AR-15?Ã¢ÂÂ Kristi Gilroy said. Ã¢ÂÂYou tell me, how big of a gun does a person need?Ã¢ÂÂ Douglas is closed for the rest of the week as teens and teachers struggle to make sense of the carnage. But Kristi Gilroy faces the difficult job of going back to school Thursday, waiting for news of the dead and injured, which might, she feared, include children sheÃ¢ÂÂd taught when they were younger.

The usual questions arose Thursday about whether it was too soon to talk about gun control. Some local officials seemed ready to toss out the oft-heard script, the prayers for families and praise for first responders. Ã¢ÂÂNow, now is the time for this country to have a conversation about sensible gun control laws in this country,Ã¢ÂÂ Broward County School Superintendent Robert W. Runcie told reporters. Ã¢ÂÂOur students are asking for that.Ã¢ÂÂ

President Trump spoke Thursday morning, taking on the grim task of comforter-in-chief, but offering no specific proposals.

Ã¢ÂÂTo every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you, whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump said. Ã¢ÂÂWe are all joined together as one American family, and your suffering is our burden also.Ã¢ÂÂ

Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking to reporters on Thursday, said that sheÃ¢ÂÂd been sitting with parents until 3:30 a.m. Ã¢ÂÂHaving to tell parents that a child, 14 years old, is dead, is the hardest thing you have to do in your career,Ã¢ÂÂ she said, her eyes full of tears.

To some, however, words of comfort wonÃ¢ÂÂt be enough. Ã¢ÂÂWhen do we actually stand up? I think itÃ¢ÂÂs the time that we all stand up,Ã¢ÂÂ Hogg demanded. Ã¢ÂÂIf you donÃ¢ÂÂt call your Congressman and do it again and again and not give up, itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be your child thatÃ¢ÂÂs next. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs horrifying.Ã¢ÂÂ

Meanwhile, Parkland waits. Waits for the names of the innocent who were gunned down before they could graduate, or in some cases, finish the ninth grade. Waits for news of funeral arrangements for a beloved football coach and security guard. Waits to hear if the children still in the hospital pull will through. Waits for someone to convince their teenagers that itÃ¢ÂÂs okay to go back to school, that theyÃ¢ÂÂre safe, and that nothing like this will happen again.

211	"An aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has been arrested for attempting to flee the country and charged with bank fraud, officials said.

Imran Awan, 37, was arrested on Monday by FBI agents and U.S. Capitol Police at Dulles International Airport trying to fly to Lahore, Pakistan.

Awan was arraigned in U.S. District Court on Tuesday with one count of bank fraud, a federal offense, and he pleaded not guilty.

Officials said Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union for $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application, according to federal court documents.

Awan worked as an information technology staffer for Wasserman Schultz, a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. David Damron, a spokesman for her office, said he was fired Tuesday.

""Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,"" Damron said in a emailed statement.

Awan and his wife, who also worked as a House aide, applied for the loan in December last year and told the loan officer that their Virginia residence listed on the application to secure the loan was not used as a rental property, court documents said.

The credit union does not provide loans based on homes that are used for rental income because they are a ""riskier"" forms of collateral, according to court documents.

However, federal agents interviewed several unidentified people who had rental agreements with the couple at the residence, according to court documents.

The credit union also required that the home listed on the application to be the primary residence of Awan and his wife. However, through surveillance, federal agents noted in court records that the couple was also residing at two other residences.

Awan's wife initiated a $283,000 wire transfer in January 2017 through the credit union to Faisalabad, Pakistan, which included the $165,000 loan, according to court documents.

His wife and their three children left the country in March with $12,700 cash from Dulles International Airport to Lahore, according to court documents.

Officials said they do not believe that his wife plans to return to the U.S.

Awan was released after his arraignment and is under a ""high-intensity supervision program,"" said Bill Miller, a U.S. AttorneyÃ¢ÂÂs office spokesman.

Awan received a GPS monitor and has a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He also must remain in a 50-mile radius of his Virginia residence. Awan was also ordered to turn over all of his passports.

A hearing is slated for August 21.

AwanÃ¢ÂÂs lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the charges are politically-motivated and ""began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives.""

""For months we have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing 'pizzagate' media but from sitting members of Congress,"" Gowen said in an emailed statement.

""Now we have the Justice Department showing up with a complaint about disclosures on a modest real estate matter. To an extent, the situation speaks for itself."""	1

OBAMA: Our consensus was strong, and our resolve is clear. Thepeople of Libya must be protected.

AMANPOUR: Another war front opens for the United States. Theworld unleashes all necessary measures to stop Libyan leader MoammarGadhafi. His son, Saif, speaks to ""This Week"" in a worldwideexclusive. What next for Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan people, for theUnited States military? How does it end?

Then, disaster in the Pacific. Nuclear nightmare scenario inJapan. How prepared is the United States? Could it happen here?Libya and Japan, two crises with major consequences for the UnitedStates.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ANNOUNCER: Live from the Newseum in Washington, D.C., ""ThisWeek"" with Christiane Amanpour, ""Target Libya,"" starts right now.

AMANPOUR: As we begin our broadcast, the United States is at warin a third Muslim country, Libya. We'll take you there live in just amoment. ABC's team of correspondents is covering every angle of thisstory. I will have an exclusive interview with Moammar Gadhafi's sonand close adviser, Saif al-Islam. And I'll be joined here in thestudio by Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,to discuss what's being called Operation Odyssey Dawn.

But first, the latest headlines in this fast-moving story. Adefiant Moammar Gadhafi is promising a long war, one day after theUnited States and a broad international coalition launched militarystrikes on his country. British and American ships and submarinesfired 112 cruise missiles at more than 20 targets on the coast.

American B-2 bombers took out a Libyan airfield, all part of thelargest Western military intervention in the Arab world since thestart of the Iraq war. The show of force is designed to impose a no-fly zone to prevent the Libyan strongman from firing on his ownpeople.

Sunday, Tripoli shook with the sound of explosions and anti-aircraft fire. Libyan state television reported that 48 people hadbeen killed.

But today, in a phone call to state television, Gadhafi saidLibyans stand ready to fight what he calls ""crusaders."" This is afight, he says, that he will win.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

M. GADHAFI (through translator): You are not capable of aprolonged -- for a prolonged war in Libya. We consider ourselvesready for a long war. Be aware of that. We're not retreatinganywhere, because this is our land. This is where we're staying.Then you're going to return defeated.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: Joining me on the line from Tripoli in Libya, Saif al-Islam, Colonel Gadhafi's second son and close adviser.

Saif, thank you for joining me. Can you tell me right now, whereare you? And what is happening there right now?

GADHAFI: You know, we are in Tripoli, as you know. Butyesterday, we were surprised that -- you know, the Americans and theBritish and the French attacked Libya, attacked five cities,terrorized people, and (inaudible) children, women were so afraidyesterday, heavy bombing everywhere. So it was a big surprise that,finally, President Obama -- we thought he's a good man and friend ofArab world -- is bombing Libya.

AMANPOUR: Saif, President Obama very explicitly gave your fatheran ultimatum and said cease fire, stop, and this won't happen. Hethen had to say that the attacks continue and the United States cannotsit idly by while a leader says that there will be no mercy. Why didyour father continue the attacks in Benghazi? Why didn't he have acease fire?

GADHAFI: First of all, our people went to Benghazi to liberateBenghazi from the gangsters and the armed militia. So if you -- ifthe Americans want to -- want to help the Libyan people in Benghazi,so go to Benghazi and liberate Benghazi from the militia and theterrorists. So do it.

AMANPOUR: My question, though, is, there is now missile strikesand an air attack against Libya. Will Colonel Gadhafi step down?Will he step aside?

GADHAFI: Step aside why? I mean, to step -- again, there's abig misunderstanding. The whole country is united against the armedmilitia and the terrorists. You asked -- simply, the Americans andother Western countries, you are supporting the terrorists and thearmed militia. That's it.

AMANPOUR: Saif, will there be Libyan retaliation against, let'ssay, commercial flights around the Mediterranean or other targets?

GADHAFI: No, this is not our target. Our target is how to helpour people in Libya, especially in Benghazi. Believe me, they areliving a nightmare, a nightmare, really, a nightmare. They have nofreedom, nothing under the rule of the armed militia.

So we urge the Americans either to go there themselves and helpour people there or let the Libyan people help their brothers inBenghazi. But believe me, one day, you wake up and you will find outthat you were supporting the wrong people. And you are being a bigmistake with supporting those people. It's like the WMD in Iraq.It's another story.

AMANPOUR: Saif al-Islam, thank you very much, indeed, forjoining us from Tripoli.

GADHAFI: Thank you.

AMANPOUR: So that's the view from the Gadhafis in Tripoli.Let's go to eastern Libya, the rebel stronghold where ABC's AlexanderMarquardt joins us live.

So what is the mood there where you are?

MARQUARDT: Good morning, Christiane. We are in Tubruq, ineastern Libya, where an opposition spokesman told us this morning thatmorale is sky high. They've been pleading for military interventionfor weeks. They now feel that there's a level playing field, that therebels will be able to push the Gadhafi forces out of the east, awayfrom cities like Ajdabiya and Benghazi that have seen heavy fightingover the last few days. Eventually, they want to make their way toTripoli, where they plan to oust Gadhafi.

We spoke with people on the streets. They're understandably veryhappy, thanking the coalition for what they've done, specificallyFrance and the U.K., for introducing the resolution at the U.N. Theybelieve that this intervention will lead to victory and eventually toa free Libya.

But with this change in tide comes a period of insurgency. Theopposition spokesman said that this is the scary part, because of howillogical Gadhafi is and because of -- because of what he calls histhirst for blood.

Christiane?

AMANPOUR: Alex, thanks.

And now let's go to the capital Tripoli, again. That could soonbe ground zero in this conflict. Moammar Gadhafi is there, and so isthe BBC's Allan Little, who joins us now live.

So, Allan, you heard from the Gadhafis. You heard the mood inBenghazi. What do you think is the next move in Tripoli? And how arethey portraying it there?

LITTLE: Well, fighting talk from Colonel Gadhafi, as from hisson, Saif, largely for domestic consumption. It's not hard to goaround the city and find people willing to echo those sentiments,diehard devotees of Colonel Gadhafi saying that -- people sayingthey're willing to die along with him if it comes to that.

There's no doubting the sincerity of those people, I think, andthe passion with which they speak. Their devotion then seems to getmore intense the more isolated he becomes from the world. Thequestion is, how representative is that voice? No other voice canmake itself heard here in the prevailing atmosphere in whichpatriotism for Libya is fused with devotion to the person of Gadhafihimself.

What are those hundreds of thousands, if not millions of peoplewho do not take part in those demonstrations of devotion, really feeland think in the silence of their own heads? What is the realsentiment of Tripoli? That is simply impossible in this atmosphere togauge.

AMANPOUR: Allan, thank you so much.

And, of course, the leaders of Britain, France, and PresidentObama is keeping a close tab on the unfolding situation. ABC's JakeTapper is live at the White House.

And, Jake, what from the White House is the end game here?What's the perspective from there?

TAPPER: Good morning, Christiane. President Obama is in Brazil.But you talked on a very, very difficult question for the White House,because it's been the position of President Obama that there should beregime change in Libya, since March 3rd, when Obama said that Gadhafihas to go.

But that is not the goal of this military operation. The goal ofthis military operation officially is to impose a no-fly zone and toprotect civilians. Gadhafi stepping down is not part of it.

So what I would expect is that you will see more effortsinternationally to arm the Libyan rebels so that they will take intotheir own hands the goal of toppling Gadhafi. But that is notofficially the goal of this military operation, so it's a delicatedance for President Obama as he attempts to make this militaryoperation even more international than previous U.S. militaryoperations.

As you know, as we've talked about, there's been a huge effort bythe White House to make this seem as though the United States is notplaying a leading role, even though, of course, we have 11 ships inthe Mediterranean, five of which were firing Tomahawk missiles.There, of course, are other nations participating in the militaryoperation, France, the U.K., and others coming in the coming days, butright now, the U.S. is taking a major leadership role, although theObama administration wants to make this seem as though it is the worldagainst Gadhafi, not Obama and the U.S. against Gadhafi, Christiane.

AMANPOUR: Jake, just very quickly, do you think the U.S. willarm the rebels?

TAPPER: I think it's a distinct possibility that the U.S. willbe part of an international effort to do so. I would doubt very muchthat the U.S. would do so on its own.

AMANPOUR: Jake, all right.

And let's go now to Martha Raddatz. The U.S. is pledging, asJake said, to step back to a support role after the initial phase.Martha, you're there. You're covering the military. Is thathappening? Do you think it's realistic to go into a support role?It's obviously very unusual in these kinds of military interventions. RADDATZ: It's certainly unusual for the U.S. And right now, aU.S. general is in charge of the operation, General Carter Ham. Andyou have an admiral, Admiral Scott -- or Sam Locklear, who is on aship. And he is the tactical commander, meaning he is coordinatingall of these air strikes.

But in a few days, the hope is, the U.S. hopes that GeneralCarter Ham can turn over his responsibility to one of the coalitionmembers. That is the plan right now. I don't think they know whothat will be.

But in this initial phase, the U.S. does have uniquecapabilities, as the president keeps saying. You had stealth bombersgoing in there. You had the B-2 bombers going in there. You hadthese Tomahawk missiles on the ships. So the U.S. felt it had to takethe lead role in this phase.

And this phase is, of course, to wipe out Gadhafi's air defenses.The next phase will be the no-fly zone. I do think the U.S. will beinvolved in that somewhat and will have fighters involved in that, butthe bulk of the no-fly zone will be flown by British pilots, Frenchpilots, and other allies.

AMANPOUR: Martha, thank you so much.

And joining me next, Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff. And we'll put that to him. I'll ask him how themissions will work, when it will end, and whether it can succeed atall if Moammar Gadhafi remains in power.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

AMANPOUR: Welcome back.

Though his son sounded subdued, Moammar Gadhafi himself wassounding undaunted this morning. He says his supporters are armed andprepared to fight, and he's pledging that this will be, quote, ""a longwar.""

Joining me now, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, AdmiralMike Mullen.

Thank you for joining us.

MULLEN: Good morning.

AMANPOUR: Is the United States leading this? Or is it in asupporting role?

MULLEN: Well, actually, the French were the first ones inyesterday, in terms of starting to establish the no-fly zone. TheUnited States is taking the lead in terms of the coalition. GeneralCarter Ham, U.S. commander of U.S. AFRICOM, is actually the commanderright now. And we look to, in the next few days, transition that to acoalition leadership."	0

State of the Union

Interview with Mitch McConnell; Interview with Robert Gibbs

Aired July 08, 2012 - 09:00 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



CANDY CROWLEY, CNN ANCHOR: June disappoints with weak job numbers. Today, unemployment and the presidential race.



(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)



BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But it is still tough out there.



FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This kick in the gut has got to end.



CROWLEY: Exclusive interviews with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Obama campaign senior adviser Robert Gibbs. Then the numbers and the politics of a sputtering economy with economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Mark Zandi, and CNN senior congressional correspondent, Dana Bash.



BILL BRADLEY, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR: If we are going to succeed, we have to face our problems squarely.



Former Democratic senator Bill Bradley on how to fix a broken Washington and what we can all do better. I'm Candy Crowley and this is STATE OF THE UNION.



(END VIDEOTAPE)



CROWLEY: Not the best of weeks for the Romney campaign. It was already under fire from friendly sources as not ready for prime time when a senior adviser said that ObamaCare is fine, for not buying insurance is not a penalty, not a tax. A big oops in political world because Republicans have used the Supreme Court decision to argue that ObamaCare is a tax hike on the middle class. Reset.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



ROMNEY: The Supreme Court has the final word, right? Is it the highest court in the land? They said it was a tax, didn't they?



UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So what do you --



ROMNEY: It's a tax. Of course, you --



CROWLEY: Too late for the conservative ""Wall Street Journal,"" which blistered the Romney campaign for looking confused and politically dumb. ""Mr. Romney,"" it read, ""promised Republicans he was the best man to make the case against President Obama, whom they desperately want to defeat. So far, Mr. Romney is letting them down.""



Joining me is Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. There are few people in Washington with a larger stake in seeing that Mitt Romney does well than you do, because you would like to go from minority leader in the Senate to majority. How do you think he has been doing? MCCONNELL: Well, the race is very, very close. I mean I think the best evidence of that is a Gallup tracking poll that has had it consistently very close. People are unhappy with the economy. They know that Mitt Romney is a job creator and I think he has got a great chance of being elected.



CROWLEY: But his campaign, as you know, has come under fire from Republicans, first as being not ready for prime time, as we said, that he needs a steady, sort of more national hand in this.



Do you have any complaints, first of all, about how they handled this whole Supreme Court tax issue, which is a major issue for you all?



MCCONNELL: Well, I think a better use of my time is to criticize the guys we are running against. I'm not here to critique the Romney campaign. I do think that we've got plenty to run against. The president has got a very, very poor record. That is why he does not want to talk about it.



I mean, take Friday's job figure, for example. You can go back two years ago and the job figure was better and the president said we are turning the -- we are turning it around. You know, clearly what they are doing is not working. And I think that is what this campaign needs to be about.



CROWLEY: And yet, we did look at the figures for this year, and you know that there were great advances in job creation in the first quarter. It's been minimal in the second quarter.



Nonetheless, still job creation. When you average out the first six months, it is something like 125,000-130,000 jobs have been created on average. That's not too bad considering where we came from, is it?



MCCONNELL: It is terrible. We have got 41 straight months now of unemployment above 8 percent, 41 straight months. Candy, this is the most tepid recovery -- if it is a recovery -- from a deep recession in American history.



The economy is just sputtering along and the reason for that, in my judgment, is because of what the administration chose to do: spend, borrow, pass this new ObamaCare law with its penalty tax in it, its mandate tax. All of this is slowing the economy down.



CROWLEY: Let me ask you about the president's jobs plan that was introduced last September, I think. And something -- this is what he is saying on the campaign trail. This was in Columbus, Ohio, in an interview with WBNS.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



OBAMA: -- making sure that we're rebuilding the infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our runways, all those things that could put construction workers back to work right now and would lift the entire economy and then, as I said, refocusing on manufacturing. That's the recipe for growth over the long term.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CROWLEY: So what's wrong with any of that? Shouldn't Congress, at this point, be saying the American people want this economy to be better? Isn't it incumbent on you all to find something you can agree on in the long list of things the president put in that jobs package and move it forward?



MCCONNELL: Well, we just passed a transportation bill, so we were addressing an issue that we had broad agreement on, that transportation is important to our economy.



But look, the way we're going to get the private sector going again is to change the way the government is treating the private sector. Things like ObamaCare, things like overregulation are causing companies not to hire. And we have got the fiscal cliff coming at the end of the year.



You know, what we ought to be doing is extend the current tax rates for another year with a hard requirement to get through comprehensive tax reform one more time. I negotiated with Vice President Biden the two-year extension of the current tax rates that we're in right now.



The president signed it because he argued that to let taxes going up would make the economy worse. We have a slower growth rate today than we had then. That would settle at least part of the problem.



CROWLEY: Let me ask you though, because they are doing nothing because you all are at odds over what you should do, is in fact, a lot of people argue, slowing the growth of the economy here in the U.S. and adding to the jobless rate, which is pretty tepid.



I want to play you something from the managing director of the IMF.

CHRISTINE LAGARDE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, IMF: The threat, only the threat of the delay in raising the debt ceiling and of the fiscal cliff could weaken growth already later this year, and should they materialize because no agreement can be reached, the domestic effects would be severe with negative spillovers to the rest of the world.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CROWLEY: So basically IMF is saying if you don't come off this fiscal cliff -- and by you, I mean Congress -- it is going to add to the uncertainty. There are certain things -- ObamaCare, you've mentioned it; regulations, that's fine.



You're not going to the Democrats to agree on it, but something that Congress could do is something about this oncoming train, which everyone sees coming, and yet there's no action. MCCONNELL: Well, what we could do and is what the House is going to do this week, I believe, is go ahead and extend the current tax rates for another year. That deals with part of the fiscal cliff.



(CROSSTALK)



CROWLEY: The president said he would veto that, so --



MCCONNELL: The president shouldn't veto that. This is the same president who signed the very same thing two years ago with the argument --



CROWLEY: I understand.



MCCONNELL: -- to do otherwise would make the economy worse.



CROWLEY: Yes.



MCCONNELL: I mean, look, the principal reason that we're having this economic trough is what the government is doing to the private sector. Now the president keeps talking about public sector employees.



Unemployment in the public sector is 4.2 percent. We've got to get the private sector going. That is only the way you have job growth, which creates revenue for the government. Everything this administration has done, Candy, has taken us in the wrong direction.



CROWLEY: But they would argue that the stimulus plan and other things they've done since and investing in infrastructure, getting construction jobs going, hiring the teachers, policemen, that that has kept this economy from being even worse over a longer period of time.



And I think, you know, again, we are seeing the same arguments we have seen now --



MCCONNELL: Yes, I know.



CROWLEY: -- for a year and a half. And I sense out there in the country -- and now we're seeing from the IMF -- that what is really worrying people is that you do nothing. It is almost not the something that you do, it is that you look up to Capitol Hill for some sort of guidance. When was the last time that you sat down with the Senate majority leader and said. how can we do this?



MCCONNELL: We have passed 11 different things the president has asked us to pass in the last six months. That is not the point.



The point is this: for two years the administration was able to do everything they wanted to. They borrowed. They spent. They had the government take over American health care. That's all in place, and the question the American people should be asking is how is that working?



Now the president would like to do more of the same. We don't think that makes sense. Why don't we try doing things that get the private sector -- which is the only way we're going to ever (inaudible) going again.



CROWLEY: We don't try, because you are in the minority and not a majority in the Senate, and yet the minority in the Senate can stop things, so, you know, the fact of the matter is don't you and Senator Reid need to sit down and say, here is how we can help the economy? Here's what we can agree on? Have you all done that?



MCCONNELL: We have, as I just indicated, passed a number of things the president's asked for.



CROWLEY: Have you sat down with senator Reid looking forward?



(CROSSTALK)



MCCONNELL: Sure. We -- every day we talk about the way forward and we have passed a number of pieces of legislation that are important and are helpful. But the primary problem is the president would like for us to keep doing more of what he was able to do the first two years when he had total control of Congress.



The American people have looked at the results of that. It clearly has not worked.



CROWLEY: Let me turn you to the Senate race races that are out there. Sitting here today and looking at the landscape, do you believe you will be the majority leader next year?



MCCONNELL: 50-50. I think it is going to be a very close, competitive election. There are a number of places where we have opportunities for pickups, not many places where we have much chance of losing a seat. I think at the end of the day, we will have a very narrow Senate one way or the other.



CROWLEY: And looking at the Virginia race and the Massachusetts race?



MCCONNELL: Two close races. Good candidates --



(CROSSTALK)



CROWLEY: You could lose as easily as you could win?



MCCONNELL: I'm sorry?



CROWLEY: You could lose as easily as you could win?



MCCONNELL: Well, they are close races. We expect to win them both, but they are close races. CROWLEY: And as you look at the Supreme Court decision over the past week and the reaction to it, and you read, I'm assuming Justice Roberts', Chief Justice Roberts' opinion on that -- are you sorry you voted for him?



MCCONNELL: No, I'm not, but I was extremely disappointed. The chief justice, however, did make it clear that the mandate is a tax, and if I may make an observation about that, Candy, you know, the mandate tax, 77 percent of it will be levied on people making $120,000 and less. And interestingly enough, that produces more tax revenue for the government than the so-called Buffett tax which the president tried to get us to pass to raise taxes on high income people.



CROWLEY: And yet there is 330 million-plus population in the U.S. or around in there, we are talking about maybe about 3 million people, at least according to the CBO, how this would -- I mean the congressional folks, according to them, this would affect maybe 3 million people. That is not that much to get 30 million people covered, is it?



MCCONNELL: Well, look, the question is the law in its entirety. The president said it would not raise taxes. It is raising taxes.



CROWLEY: On very few people, though, you would concede that.



MCCONNELL: Well, it is important to those people, and they are middle-income people. More tax revenue raised from middle-income people than the Buffett tax would raise from high-income people from a president who promised not to raise taxes on anyone. It is also driving premiums up. The cost of health care is going up. It cut Medicare by half a trillion dollars over the next ten years. Nothing that was said in connection with passing this health care bill is working out.



CROWLEY: Senator, I want you thank you for joining us this morning. I hope you will come back.



MCCONNELL: I will.



CROWLEY: Jobs and the president's plan for winning the battleground states with Obama campaign senior adviser Robert Gibbs when we come back.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CROWLEY: I'm joined by Obama campaign senior adviser Robert Gibbs. Good to see you, Robert.



I want to run you through a series of economic figures and polls, and then get your comment at the end. First of all, when you ask folks what are economic conditions like today -- good, 27 percent. Poor, 73 percent. When you say, how important is the economy to your vote? 92 percent say it is either very or extremely important to their vote.



GIBBS: Who are the other 8 percent? CROWLEY: Exactly. To their vote. And then finally, who would better handle the economy. Romney 48 percent, Obama 47 percent. If the economy is doing better, as the president argues, not as good as you want but better, why are those numbers like that?



GIBBS: Well, look, I think we are coming out of the hardest economic time in our country's history. CROWLEY: Which we have been doing for four years.



GIBBS: We have been, and typically when you come out of the recession, the depths that we were in, that's caused by a financial crisis, which is what happened, it takes a while to dig out of that hole. We saw on Friday that our economy is growing and we are adding jobs. The president believes that --



CROWLEY: Not enough jobs.



GIBBS: We are not growing fast enough and we're not adding enough jobs.



CROWLEY: So what is the argument to, like, after four years, what is then the argument that re-elect me?



GIBBS: Well, Candy, we have made progress, but we have got a long way to go, and this is going to be an election about two different visions. You heard part of it here just a minute ago with Senator McConnell and you hear it with Mitt Romney every day. The best way to create jobs is to provide millionaires and billionaires with greater tax cuts, take financial regulations off of things like banks and Wall Street, and somehow we will see jobs flourish for years and years to come. The problem with that is that it is not a theory. We tried it for eight years, and it ended in this huge economic calamity and this financial mess.



CROWLEY: But the jobs are not flourishing now, and folks don't actually seem to think that the president would handle it better than Mitt Romney, so I'm just trying to figure out what the sales pitch is here.



GIBBS: Well, the other vision is that we have to grow this economy like we did for years and years and decades from the middle- class out. Let's continue to add opportunity, let's bring this American dream back, let's guarantee that if you work hard and play by the rules, you will have a chance to get ahead, that your children will have a chance to get ahead. And again, we have tried these different philosophies before. We know what tax breaks and tax cuts for the wealthy and financial regulations off of Wall Street mean. They mean economic calamity, they mean what we are dealing with now, versus a vision where we add jobs and build out of the middle-class. People take responsibility, they work hard, but they get ahead. And that is what we need to do.



CROWLEY: I think, you know, even the Republicans would, you know, that you think have this different version, would say, we want to grow the middle-class, that is where our aim is.



GIBBS: That is not their primary aim. Their primary aim is to give tax breaks to the very wealthy.



CROWLEY: That is what you think their primary aim is, but --



GIBBS: Let's look at the central plank in Mitt Romney's so- called economic plan. And granted, this is -- most of his economic plans and most of his plans are secret, but the one thing that he has fleshed out is to take the Bush tax cuts, which disproportionately impact millionaires and billionaires, and add to them. Candy, do you think we are a Bush tax away for a millionaire away from a flourishing economy? Or should we protect and keep taxes low for middle-class families and give them a chance?



CROWLEY: Do you think the president will do anything other than veto a bill that would keep those Bush tax cuts for everyone intact?



GIBBS: We should protect the tax cuts for the middle-class, and we should let tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires expire.



CROWLEY: Even though recovery is not that great, and people say don't take money out of this economy, it is not the time for a tax hike, you would go ahead and do it for those making $250,000 and above.



GIBBS: We ought to do something about this deficit, and we ought to protect middle class tax cuts, and the best way to do that is to let the upper-end tax cuts expire, let the wealthy in this country that had been doing fine for years and years and years begin to pay their fair share, and make sure that we protect the tax rate that middle-class families have had for the past many years.



CROWLEY: So the president is totally committed to getting rid of the tax cut for those making $250,000 and above.



GIBBS: Let's make some progress on our spending by doing away with tax cuts for people who quite frankly don't need them, tax cuts that have not worked, and have them pay their fair share.



CROWLEY: So is that a yes or a no? The president is completely committed to this, he won't allow it to happen?



GIBBS: He is 100 percent committed to it.



CROWLEY: OK. I want to play an ad that you all have been running, and then ask you about it.



Or not.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mitt Romney campaigned as a job creator.



ROMNEY: I know how jobs are created.



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But as a corporate raider, he shipped jobs to China and Mexico. As a governor, he did the same thing, outsourcing state jobs to India. Now he is making the exact same pitch. ROMNEY: I know why the jobs come and why they go.



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Outsourcing jobs, Romney economics, it didn't work then and it won't work now.



(END VIDEOTAPE)



CROWLEY: You all have invested very heavily in the Bain Capital element of trying to convince people of what Mitt Romney is about. And yet, this particular ad got four pinocchios from the Washington Post, which is not true. And this is what Factcheck.org had to say. ""We found no evidence to support the claim that Romney, while he was still running Bain Capital, shipped American jobs overseas."" You now have a similar ad out. Why do you keep with that?



GIBBS: Well, I've got to say factcheck.org ought to read the Washington Post, which is the one that came up with a report that said looking at SEC filings that Mitt Romney and Bain Capital were pioneers in outsourcing. They shipped jobs all over the world that could and should have been--



CROWLEY: You say that Romney was, but the point, their point is that in fact, Mitt Romney was not running Bain. He had cut ties and gone off.



GIBBS: That also is not true, because Mitt Romney was the head and sole owner of Bain longer than Mitt Romney has admitted to being the sole owner of Bain.



But let's understand this, because we saw this a little bit again this week. We have got a guy who believes and has been a pioneer in outsourcing jobs, and quite frankly, he offshores most of his own personal investments, presumably to shield them from taxes.



Candy, I don't know about you, I pick a bank because there is an ATM near my home, right? Mitt Romney has a bank account in Switzerland. He's got a shell company--



CROWLEY: Nothing illegal, right? You are not charging that he has done anything illegal with any of this? GIBBS: Candy, nobody knows why he has a corporation in Bermuda, why he failed to disclose that on seven different financial disclosures, why he transferred it to somebody else's purview the day before he became governor of Massachusetts. The one thing he can do, Candy, to clear up whether or not he's done anything illegal, whether he's shielding his income from taxes in Bermuda or Switzerland, is to do what every other presidential candidate has done, and that is release a series of years of their own tax returns. Mitt Romney's father was the pioneer for releasing a series of tax returns. The best way to figure out if Mitt Romney is complying with American tax law is to have him release more of his tax returns.



This is a guy whose slogan is believe in America, and it should be business in Bermuda, that is what Mitt Romney is all about.



CROWLEY: Which is a great line, but again, there is no evidence here that any of the fact check organizations have found that A, he outsourced jobs, or was president of Bain when it happened, and B, that he has done anything illegal. You have had a lot of advice from folks, Democrats saying get off of this particular Bain thing. There is obviously some polling that shows in fact it's having some effect in some of the battleground states, but why--



GIBBS: Again, this is an ad that's based on a report that the Washington Post did. OK? So I would encourage everyone go to Washingtonpost.com and read that report. The reason that we'll keep talking about this is, this is important. Are we going to create jobs here in America, we're going to bring them back from overseas, we're going to do away with tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, or are we going to invest in manufacturing here in this country? You know, we have created half a million manufacturing jobs. More manufacturing jobs have been created in the last few years than since the mid-90s. Mitt Romney famously said we ought to let Detroit and the auto industry go bankrupt. Again, I go back to two very different visions about this economy.



CROWLEY: Right. I have to end it there, I'm sorry, I hope you come back. Robert Gibbs, senior adviser to the Obama campaign. Thanks.



GIBBS: Thank you.



CROWLEY: Four more jobs reports before the election, the problems and the solutions when we come back.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



ROMNEY: The president's policies have not gotten America working again.



OBAMA: Businesses have created 4.4 million new jobs over the past 28 months.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



(COMMERCIAL BREAK) CROWLEY: With me now, Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz- Eakin, and CNN senior congressional correspondent Dana Bash. So let's just straighten out this economy thing. And have you all tell me, A, what was the most worrisome thing in the economic report we got, the jobless report, and what makes you think, OK, we can still survive this. Let's start with you.



ZANDI: Well, 80,000 jobs is pretty disappointing. If we stick at 80,000, if that is the reality of what is going on, then unemployment is going to rise, and we have an 8.2 percent unemployment rate, and that is a problem. So that is the most worrisome aspect of the report.



But there were some positives -- hours worked increased. That's a good leading indicator. Businesses will ask workers to work longer hours before they hire. And we did see--



CROWLEY: So that is a precursor to new jobs.



ZANDI: It is.



CROWLEY: Sometimes.



ZANDI: Generally is. And hours worked were actually at a pretty high level, so any pickup of activity will probably translate into more jobs, and we got a big increase in wages, which was encouraging. I had been nervous that wage growth had been slowing, but that does not appear to be the case. It is pretty solid.



CROWLEY: Douglas, what do you think?



HOLTZ-EAKIN: Well, those points are right. One of the real disappointing characteristics of this recovery has been not just the jobs, but the lack of income growth, and that has hurt the ability of households to spend, and to see some strength in wages was a very important part of this report.



I think the really troubling issue is that this report came on the heels of some other reports that showed manufacturing slowing, the service sector slowing, and to the extent that employment is a lagging sort of indicator, that we could have further trouble down the road. And I'm worried about the outlook for that reason.



CROWLEY: I tried to get Robert Gibbs to tell us how the president plays this at this point, because I think people look and think, we just thought we'd be so much further along. How do the Romney folks play this, and is there any sign that it is working, and what can the president do?



BASH: Well, the Romney folks, what they think their message is going to be going forward isn't so much the Reagan, are you better off now than you were four years ago? It's what we all witnessed four years ago, the high expectations, the soaring rhetoric, the -- you know, as Sarah Palin would say, the ""hopey-changey"" thing. Do you feel that? Or do you feel like -- ?



CROWLEY: Consumer confidence?



BASH: What happened? What happened?



CROWLEY: Yes.



BASH: So it's not -- it's that the expectations were set so high, and that is what the Romney campaign wants to hit big time going forward.



Having said that, there was some criticism, sort of friendly fire, from Republican editorial boards -- you showed some of the quotes to Mitch McConnell. That's a concern because Mitt Romney should be doing very well against somebody with 8.2 percent unemployment. And the concern is, especially given the fact that his calling card is business acumen, why isn't he doing better?



CROWLEY: Let me read you something from Brian Cropp (ph) -- I don't know if either one of you know him -- he is on the corporate executive board, a managing director here, and here is what he had to say about a two-tiered job market.



""We continue to hear from companies that it's a two-tiered labor market. For people who have been employed with professional and technical skills, it's a decent job market. But for the rest of the workforce, it's still very difficult.""



Is that accurate that we're getting a sort of a two Americas when you look at the jobless rate?



HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think there's an element or two to it. But to say that there is two Americas is too strong. I mean, it is always the case that during expansions, some skills and some sectors do better than others, and we are seeing that right now. There's no question. High school people have done better, and that is not unusual, especially in tough economic times.



So the challenge is to have enough economic growth that the people who have -- at the moment have sort of a relatively low-skilled job can get in, get the kind of experience that allows them to turn into the other part of America, and we're just not seeing that right now.



ZANDI: I am sympathetic to that description. I mean, I think if you have education, if you've gone to college, if you have the skills, you are doing OK. You're doing pretty well. If you look at the unemployment rates for people with college degrees and lots of skills, very -- it is really quite low.



CROWLEY: (Inaudible).



ZANDI: (Inaudible). And those folks that don't have skills and education, they are getting creamed in this economy.



CROWLEY: And that --



HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think the key here is the income. I think -- they might have jobs, but they're not getting college and skilled level incomes out of this recovery, and the other guys are getting creamed.



BASH: And that does feed into the political divide of the two Americas, Candy, no question, that President Obama historically has struggled with the sort of uneducated voter or the voter who doesn't have the high education, and he struggles with the lunch bucket voter, and this feeds right into that.



ZANDI: I want to push back on your point about people expecting this to be better than it is. The reality is that, after financial crises, like the one we went through -- and it was a devastating crisis -- you just look at the string of financial institutions that just are no longer with us, you always have very weak economic recovery. This is the history of economics, all the way back to the 1400s.



So it's not atypical that an economy would struggle like it is, and we have made improvements. I mean --



(CROSSTALK)



CROWLEY: You would know that because you know stuff like that, but --



HOLTZ-EAKIN: And the president and his advisers pooh-poohed that research early on, said no, no, no, that's not true. We can do this and get out quicker and they sold it politically that they would get out quicker, and they were probably wrong.



ZANDI: And, Doug, I think we are going to get out quicker than what has happened typically in history, but in history, it has been a decade before economies get out. And we're going to get out a lot faster than that, but, you know, we're only three years, four years after the nadir of all of this.



And to say we have created 4 million jobs in the last couple of years, I think that's actually quite an improvement.



But you are right, Candy, I'm talking as an economist. I'm not talking as a person on the street who has been nailed by this.



BASH: And we are in a fast food nation right now. We're in the Twitter nation, where three years is six lifetimes, where everything happens very, very fast. And that's the problem (inaudible).



CROWLEY: I want you all to stick with me. We've talked about the problems. After the break, we want to talk about some solutions.



And later, solving Washington's problems may be easier than you might think.



BILL BRADLEY, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR: It is not a quick fix, but it begins essentially by people telling you the truth.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CROWLEY: With me now, Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody Analytics, former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Holtz- Eakin, and CNN senior congressional correspondent Dana Bash.



I have talked to folks, like you all, that have said, you know, the truth is, there is not a whole lot the president or even the Fed can do to make a major change in the state of the economy, that we are now looking at a kind of a new normal with above 6 percent unemployment for the out years, as they say, maybe a decade or so to come. Do you go with that?



ZANDI: Not me. No, I disagree totally with that. I think our economy is on the precipice of very strong economic growth. I think that American companies have restructured, they've gotten their cost structures down, they've reduced debt, they have lots of cash. It's a matter of confidence. It's not a matter of ability to go out and expand. And I think they will. And I think there's a lot that the Federal Reserve and the administration and Congress can do, most importantly -- you were talking about this with senator McConnell -- is we have got to nail down this fiscal cliff because this is making business people nervous and it's the reason why they are not taking that step to hire more workers.



So I don't think we're in a new normal.



CROWLEY: Are you bullish about the future?



HOLTZ-EAKIN: We get to dictate the normal. In the '60s and '70s, we took a series of policy steps that left us with chronic high inflation, chronic high unemployment. And then we changed course in the '80s and '90s, and we got a much better performance.



So I'm with Mark. We can do much better than we're doing now. I don't think that if you round up the usual cast of characters -- this is a lot like ""Casablanca"" -- that you look at the Fed, I actually don't think there's much they can do right now.

219	"Births: Preliminary Data for 2005

by Brady E. Hamilton, Ph.D.; Joyce A. Martin, M.P.H.; and Stephanie J. Ventura, M.A. Division of Vital Statistics

This report from the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionÃ¢ÂÂs National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) summarizes 2005 preliminary births and birth rates and selected 2005 preliminary maternal and infant health birth data for the United States. The findings come from a substantial portion of the records of births (99.2 percent) that occurred in calendar year 2005 and were received and processed by NCHS as of May 31, 2006. A report that includes both these demographic and health characteristics of births as well as state-based preliminary 2005 data is in preparation ( 1 ).

Results from Preliminary Birth Data, 2005

Births and birth rates

Key findings, illustrated in Tables 1-3, 5-8 , and Figures 1-3 , show:

The number of births and the general fertility rate (GFR) increased slightly, whereas the crude birth rate remained unchanged from 2004 to 2005. The preliminary estimate of births in 2005, 4,140,419, increased 1 percent from 2004 ( Tables 1 , 5 , 6 , and 8 ) ( 2 ). Births rose for Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), Asian or Pacific Islander (API), and non-Hispanic black women, but declined slightly for non-Hispanic white women. The crude birth rate in 2005 was 14.0 births per 1,000 total population, unchanged from 2004. The preliminary 2005 GFR (66.7 births per 1,000 women age 15-44 years), however, rose slightly from 2004, to the highest level since 1993 ( 2 ). The GFR rose for Hispanic and AIAN women, declined slightly for API women, and was essentially unchanged for non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black women.

The birth rate for teenagers declined 2 percent in 2005, falling to 40.4 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 years, a 35-percent drop compared with the most recent peak in 1991 (61.8), and the lowest ever recorded in the 65 years for which a consistent series of rates is available ( Tables 2 , 5 , 7 , and Figures 1 and 2 ) ( 3 ).

The decline was concentrated among teenagers aged 15-17 years, for whom the birth rate fell 3 percent, to 21.4 births per 1,000, another record low for the Nation. The rate for this age group has dropped 45 percent since 1991 (38.6).

The rate for older teenagers, 18-19 years, essentially stable at 69.9 births per 1,000 according to preliminary data for 2005, was 26 percent lower than in 1991 (94.0). The birth rate for the youngest teenage group, 10-14 years, was unchanged in 2005, at 0.7 births per 1,000 females.

Among race and Hispanic origin subgroups, birth rates fell 3 percent each for non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black teenagers 15-19 years. The decline for young non-Hispanic black teenagers 15-17 years was 6 percent for 2004-2005 and 59 percent since 1991, the steepest reduction overall by race or age group.

Births to women in their early twenties increased slightly. The birth rate for women aged 20Ã¢ÂÂ24 years rose to 102.2 births per 1,000 women in 2005, less than 1 percent over the rate in 2004. The rate for women aged 25Ã¢ÂÂ29 years, the highest rate amongst the age groups, was essentially unchanged in 2005 (115.6) ( Tables 5 and 7 ).

Childbearing by women in their thirties and forties continued to increase. The birth rate for women aged 30Ã¢ÂÂ34 years rose slightly between 2004 and 2005, to 95.9 births per 1,000, the highest rate since 1964. The rate for women aged 35-39 years rose to 46.3 births per 1,000, 2 percent over the rate in 2004 and the highest rate since 1965 [ 2 , 3 ]. The birth rate for women 40Ã¢ÂÂ44 years also rose by 2 percent, to 9.1, the highest rate since 1968, and the rate for women aged 45Ã¢ÂÂ49 years increased slightly, to 0.6 births per 1,000 women, the first increase in the rate since 2000 and the highest rate for this age group since 1970 ( Tables 5 and 7 ).



Among race and Hispanic origin groups, the rates for women aged 30-34 years increased for Hispanic and non-Hispanic black women (about 2 percent each) and decreased for API women (about 2 percent). The rates for non-Hispanic white and AIAN women were essentially unchanged in 2005. Rates for women aged 35-39 years increased by 2 percent for women in each of the three largest groups (non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic blacks). The rates for the remaining groups were essentially unchanged.

The total fertility rate (TFR) rose slightly in 2005 to 2,054.0, compared with 2,045.5 in 2004 ( Table 1 ) ( 2 ). The TFR summarizes the potential impact of current fertility patterns on completed family size to estimate the average number of births that a hypothetical group of 1,000 women would have over their lifetimes. The total fertility rate by race and Hispanic origin increased significantly in 2005 for only Hispanic women (2 percent), and decreased significantly for only non-Hispanic white women (less than 1 percent) ( Table 1 ). Rates for non-Hispanic black, AIAN, and API women were essentially unchanged between 2004 and 2005.

The first birth rate for women aged 15-44 years was 26.5 births per 1,000, a slight increase over the rate in 2004 ( Table 7 ). The first birth rates for women aged 20-24 and 35-39 years increased between 2004 and 2005 by 2 and 1 percent, respectively, whereas rates for women aged 15-19, 25-29, and 30-34 years decreased by 1 to 2 percent. Rates for women 40 years of age and over were unchanged.

Crude birth rates (CBR) vary considerably among states ranging, in 2005, from 10.4 births per 1,000 total population in Vermont to 20.9 in Utah ( Table 8 ). There were generally only small changes in the birth rates for most states in 2005 compared with 2004; rates in 10 states declined significantly (Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Texas, and Utah) and rates in 7 states (Alabama, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wyoming) increased significantly.



Fertility rates also vary considerably among states, ranging from 51.0 births per 1,000 women age 15-44 years in Vermont to 90.4 in Utah (see Table 8 ). General fertility rates for most states changed relatively little between 2004 and 2005, like the CBR, however, rates for 16 states increased significantly (Alabama, California, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming), whereas rates for 3 states (Louisiana, New York, and Utah) decreased significantly.

All measures of childbearing by unmarried women increased to record levels for the Nation in 2005 according to preliminary data ( 2 , 4 ). The total number of births rose 4 percent to 1,525,345, compared with 1,470,189 in 2004. During 2002-2005, the number increased 12 percent overall.

The birth rate increased 3 percent in 2005 to 47.6 per 1,000 unmarried women aged 15-44 years, up from 46.1 in 2004.

The proportion of births to unmarried women increased in 2005 to 36.8 percent, compared with 35.8 percent in 2004. The proportions increased for all population subgroups by race and Hispanic origin ( Table 1 and Figure 3 ).

In 2005, well over four in five births to teenagers were nonmarital ( Table 3 ). Over one-half of births to women aged 20-24 years and nearly 3 in 10 births to women aged 25-29 years were to unmarried women.

Maternal and Infant Health Birth Characteristics

Key findings, illustrated in Table 4 and Figures 4 and 5 , show:

The preliminary rate of cesarean delivery rose 4 percent in 2005 to 30.2 percent of all births, another record high for the Nation ( Table 4 ). The cesarean rate declined somewhat during the early and mid-1990s, but has risen 46 percent since 1996 (from 20.7 percent). Rates were up in 2005 for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, AIAN, API, and Hispanic women, and also for each 5-year age group. Since 1996, rates have risen by more than 40 percent for all age groups, including for young women under 20 years of age (see Figure 4 ). (For information on trends for 1989 to 2004 in primary cesarean deliveries and vaginal births after a previous cesarean, see Ã¢ÂÂBirths: Final Data for 2004Ã¢ÂÂ ( 2 ).)

The preterm birth rate rose from 12.5 to 12.7 percent for 2004-2005 (see Figure 5 ). The percentage of infants delivered at less than 37 completed weeks of gestation has risen 20 percent since 1990 (from 10.6 percent) ( 2 ). Preterm rates rose significantly for non-Hispanic white (11.7 percent for 2005), non-Hispanic black (18.4 percent) and Hispanic infants (12.1 percent) between 2004 and 2005. Rates for non-Hispanic white and Hispanic births have been rising for more than a decade, increasing 38 percent for non-Hispanic white, and 10 percent for Hispanic infants since 1990. The preterm rate for black infants declined modestly during the 1990s, but has been on the rise since the year 2000. Although the upswing in multiple births has had an important influence on recent trends in preterm birth rates, shorter gestations have also risen among singleton deliveries ( 2 ).

The proportion of all infants born very preterm (less than 32 completed weeks of gestation) rose very slightly between 2004 and 2005 (from 2.01 to 2.03 percent). Late preterm births (34-36 weeks) increased more markedly, from 8.9 to 9.1 percent for the same period. No significant change was observed in the percentage of 32-33 week births. Much of the upturn in the preterm rate over recent years can be attributed to increases in late preterm births ( 2 ), Figure 5 . Although at lower risk than those born at earlier gestational ages, infants delivered late preterm are at greater risk of compromised pregnancy outcome than those born later in pregnancy ( 5 , 6 ).

The percentage of infants born low birthweight also increased in 2005, to 8.2 percent of all births, from 8.1 percent in 2004 ( Table 4 ). The percentage of infants born low birthweight (less than 2,500 grams) has increased more than 20 percent since the mid-1980s (from 6.7) ( 2 ); the 2005 level is the highest level reported since 1968 ( 7 ). Low birthweight rates rose 1 to 2 percent for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic infants between 2004 and 2005. Among all births, levels of both very low (less than 1,500 grams), and moderately low birthweight (1,500-2,499 grams) increased slightly for the current year.

Technical Notes

Nature and sources of data

Preliminary data for 2005 are based on a substantial proportion of births for that year (99.2 percent). The data for 2005 are based on a continuous receipt and processing of statistical records through May 31, 2006, by the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionÃ¢ÂÂs National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS receives the data from the statesÃ¢ÂÂ vital registration systems through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. In this report, U.S. totals include only events occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Detailed information on reporting completeness and imputation procedures may be found in the Ã¢ÂÂTechnical AppendixÃ¢ÂÂ of Vital Statistics of the United States, 2004, Natality (8).

To produce the preliminary estimates shown in this report, records in the file were weighted using independent control counts of all 2005 births by state of occurrence. Detailed information on weighting is available elsewhere (8). Detailed information on the reliability of estimates also may be found elsewhere (1).

The 1989 and 2003 U.S. Standard Certificates of Live Birth

This report includes selected 2005 data on items that are collected on both the 1989 Revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth (unrevised) and 2003 Revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth (revised). The 2003 revision is described in detail elsewhere (2,9-11). Twelve states and one U.S. territory (Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York State (excluding New York City), Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington) implemented the revised certificate as of January 1, 2005. One additional state, Vermont, implemented the revised birth certificate in 2005, but after January 1. These 13 states represent 30.8 percent of all 2005 births; the 12 states that implemented as of January 1, 2005, represent 30.6 percent of all births.

Hispanic origin and race

Hispanic origin

Race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the birth certificate. Data shown by race (i.e., American Indian or Alaska Native and Asian or Pacific Islander) include persons of Hispanic or non-Hispanic origin, and data for Hispanic origin include persons of any race. Data shown for Hispanic persons include all persons of Hispanic origin of any race. Data are shown separately for non-Hispanic white women because there are substantial differences in childbearing patterns between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women.

Single, multiple, and Ã¢ÂÂbridgedÃ¢ÂÂ race

The 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth allows the reporting of more than one race (multiple races) for each parent (9). Information on this change is presented in a recent report (2).

In 2005, multiple race was reported by Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York State (excluding New York City), Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont (for births occurring from July 1, 2005, only), and Washington, which used the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth, as well as, California, Hawaii, Michigan (for births at selected facilities only), Ohio, Utah, and Minnesota, which used the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth. In addition, multiple race was also reported by Puerto Rico. Data from the vital records of the remaining 31 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia are based on the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth that follows the 1977 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standard, allowing only a single race to be reported (11-13).

In order to provide uniformity and comparability of the data during the transition period, before all or most of the data are available in the new multiple race format, it was necessary to Ã¢ÂÂbridgeÃ¢ÂÂ the responses of those who reported more than one race (multiple race) to one, single race (see Ã¢ÂÂPopulation denominatorsÃ¢ÂÂ). Information on the processing and tabulation of data by race is presented in a recent report (2)

Marital status

National estimates of births to unmarried women are based on two methods of determining marital status. For 2004 and 2005, birth certificates in 48 states and the District of Columbia included a direct question about motherÃ¢ÂÂs marital status; in two of these states, California and Nevada, a direct question is part of the electronic birth registration process but does not appear on certified or paper copies of the birth certificate. The question in most states is: Ã¢ÂÂMother married? (At birth, conception, or any time between) (Yes or no)Ã¢ÂÂ. Marital status is inferred in Michigan and New York. A birth is inferred as nonmarital if a paternity acknowledgment was filed or if the fatherÃ¢ÂÂs name is missing from the birth certificate (listed in respective priority-of-use order).

Population denominators

Birth and fertility rates for 2005 shown in this report are based on population estimates based on the 2000 census, as of July 1, 2005. These population estimates are available on the NCHS Web- page (14). The production of these population estimates is described in detail in a recent report (2).

Information on the national estimates of births to unmarried women (i.e., methods of determining marital status) and the computation of the preliminary birth rates for unmarried women is presented elsewhere (1). The birth rate for unmarried women for 2005 is estimated on the basis of population distributions by marital status provided by the U.S. Census Bureau as of March 2005 applied to the national population estimates as of July 1 (4,14,15). Both population files are 2000 census based. The nonmarital birth rate shown here for 2005 thus differs from those published by NCHS in the annual final reports, which are based on populations estimated from 3-year averages of the marital status distributions, rather than a single year as shown here (4). Population estimates for a single year are not an adequate basis for computing age-specific birth rates for unmarried womenÃ¢ÂÂthese rates are available only in reports based on final data.

220	"The following is a transcript of Senator Joseph R. Biden JrÃ¢ÂÂs remarks after being introduced as Senator Barack ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs vice-presidential running mate in Springfield, Ill., as recorded by CQ Transcriptions:

Well, it's great to be here! On the steps of the old State House in the land of Lincoln. President Lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place. Then stand firm. Today, Springfield, I know my feet are in the right place. And I am proud to stand firm for the next president of the United States of America, Barack Obama. Folks, Barack and I come from very different places, but we share a common story. An American story. He was the son of a single mom, a single mom who had to struggle to support her son and her kids. But she raised him. She raised him to believe in America. to believe that in this country there is no obstacle that could keep you from your dreams. If you are willing to work hard and fight for it. I was different. I was an Irish-Catholic kid from Scranton with a father who like many of yours in tough economic times fell on hard times, but my mom and dad raised me to believe, it's a saying Barack you heard me say before, my dad repeated it and repeated it. Said champ, it's not how many times you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get up. It's how quickly you get up. Ladies and gentlemen, that's your story. That's America's story. It's about if you get up, you can make it.

That's the America Barack Obama and I believe in. That's the American dream. And ladies and gentlemen, is there no ordinary times, and this is no ordinary election. Because the truth of the matter is, and you know it, that American dream under eight years of Bush and McCain, that American dream is slipping away. I don't have to tell you that. You feel it in your lives. You see it in your shrinking wages, and the cost of everything from groceries to health care to college to filling up your car at the gas station. It keeps going up and up and up, and the future keeps receding further and further and further away as you reach for your dreams. You know, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a mere political saying. I say with every fiber of my being I believe we cannot as a nation stand for four more years of this. We cannot afford to keep giving tax cuts after tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthiest Americans while the middle class America, middle class families are falling behind and their wages are actually shrinking. We can't afford four more years of a government that does nothing while they watch the housing market collapse. As you know, it's not just the millions of people facing foreclosure. It's the tens of millions of your neighbors who are seeing the values of their homes drop off a cliff along with their dreams.

Ladies and gentlemen, your kitchen table is like mine. You sit there at night before you put the kids -- after you put the kids to bed and you talk, you talk about what you need. You talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's not a worry John McCain has to worry about. It's a pretty hard experience. He'll have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at. Folks, again, it's not political sloganary when I say we literally can't afford four more years of this non- energy policy written by and for the oil companies, making us more and more dependent from hostile nations on our ability to run this country and literally, not figuratively, literally putting America's security at risk, we can't afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrificed our moral standing around the world.

Ladies and gentlemen, that's the bad news. But there is good news, America. We don't have to have four more years of George W. Bush. And John McCain. The next President of the United States is going to be delivered to the most significant moment in American history since Franklin Roosevelt. He will have such an incredible opportunity, incredible opportunity, not only to change the direction of America, but literally, literally to change the direction of the world. Barack Obama and I believe, we believe with every fiber in our being that our families, our communities as Americans, there's not a single solitary challenge we cannot face if we level with the American people. And I don't say that to say it; history, history has shown it. When have Americans ever, ever, ever, let their country down when they've had a leader to lead them?"	0

What is a Presidential Library and Museum?

Presidential Libraries and Museums promote understanding of the presidency and the American experience. We preserve and provide access to historical materials, support research, and create interactive programs and exhibits that educate and inspire. Presidential Libraries and Museums hold vast archives of documents, feature museums full of important Presidential artifacts, present compelling educational and public programs, and host informative websites. Presidential Libraries and Museums are not traditional lending libraries, but instead are repositories for the papers, records and historical materials of each Presidential administration. We work to ensure that these irreplaceable items are preserved and made available for the widest possible use.

Presidential Libraries and Museums give you the chance to see, hear, and participate in the events that changed our lives and shaped our national story.

History

How did the Presidential Library System begin?

It all began with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the late 1930s.

A dramatic increase in the volume of Presidential papers led Roosevelt to seek the advice of prominent historians and public figures on how and where to keep not only his White House files, but also his earlier papers, book collection, and memorabilia.

Roosevelt announced plans for a new type of facility, a Presidential Library, on December 10, 1938. An organization was chartered to raise private funds for the construction of the building on RooseveltÃ¢ÂÂs Hyde Park estate.

On July 18, 1939, Congress passed a joint resolution accepting the new facility and agreeing to operate it as part of the National Archives. The Roosevelt Library was turned over to the Federal government on July 4, 1940, and dedicated on June 30, 1941.

The Roosevelt Library became the model for subsequent Presidential Libraries. Succeeding Libraries have been constructed with private and other non-Federal funds. A private, non-profit organization is formed to coordinate these efforts and provide support for Library and museum programs.

Once each Library was constructed, NARA assumed responsibility for its operation and maintenance in accordance with the Presidential Libraries Acts of 1955 and 1986. In 2017, President Barack Obama and NARA announced plans for the first digital presidential library, without a dedicated federal facility.

Learn more about the history of the Presidential Libraries.

What is the role of the Office of Presidential Libraries within the National Archives?

The Office of Presidential Libraries is the office responsible for the overall administration of the Presidential Library System. The office and the Libraries are within the Legislative Archives, Presidential Libraries, and Museum Services division of the National Archives.

This office provides budgetary and administrative oversight for the system, organizes multi-Library and system-wide initiatives, coordinates the development and implementation of NARA policies and procedures, and represents the Presidential Library System within the National Archives. The Office of Presidential Libraries also oversees new Presidential Library development, major construction and renovation projects at the libraries and national programs aligning the work of the Presidential Libraries.

View the National Archives organizational chart for more information.

Does the Obama Library follow the same model as earlier Presidential Libraries?

No. The Obama Foundation, a private entity, made the decision in 2017 not to construct a Presidential Library for NARA to house the records (textual, audiovisual, and artifacts). Instead, the Obama Foundation plans to build and operate a private museum and presidential center in Chicago. NARA will digitize and then store and preserve all original presidential records and artifacts in an existing NARA facility that meets NARAÃ¢ÂÂs standards for archival storage. NARA retains legal and physical custody of the records and artifacts. NARA will maintain, preserve, and provide access to the Presidential records of the Obama administration, in accordance with the Presidential Records Act, employing a digital model for access to opened records and loans of materials for display around the world, including at the private Obama Presidential Center. Educational and public programs, both live and virtual, will also be a critical component of the Obama Presidential Library.

Are there any plans to extend the Obama Library model to existing Presidential Libraries and Museums?

NARA has no plans to apply this change retroactively.

Will this be the new model for all presidential libraries going forward?

Decisions about future library models will be made in consultation between NARA and each outgoing presidential administration. Considering the increasing volume of born-digital records, digital libraries will support the expectations of the public that our holdings be available free and online. We welcome exploring new approaches to presidential libraries, which open up more options for future former presidents beyond traditional brick-and-mortar facilities and ultimately improve public access to records and collections.

When are the records of a former President open for research?

For older Presidential Libraries (Hoover through Carter, with the exception of Nixon), access to the holdings are governed by deeds of gift, and the papers are processed according to prioritized plans developed by each Library. Major areas of current research interest and the timeliness of topics in the national arena are also considered. Nixon Presidential materials are governed by the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (PRMPA), and material is reviewed in accordance with established regulations.

For newer Libraries (from Reagan forward), the holdings are governed by the Presidential Records Act (PRA) of 1978. Under the PRA, the records are exempt from public release for five years after the end of a Presidential administration. During this five-year period, archivists begin processing and preparing materials for release to researchers.

After the end of the five-year period, all Presidential records become subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. These requests must be made in writing and cite the Freedom of Information Act and then be submitted to the appropriate Library by mail, e-mail, fax, or in person.

The Libraries whose Presidential holdings are governed by the PRA work to respond to FOIA requests from the general public. They process records and make them publicly available not only to requestors but also to anyone interested in conducting research on the particular topics covered by FOIA requests.

Learn more available about requesting access to records.

How can a researcher find out what records are open at a Presidential Library?

Each Presidential Library has digitized a portion of their textual and audiovisual collections and made them available on their websites.

The Presidential Daily Diary is the official record of the presidentsÃ¢ÂÂ travel, meetings, and telephone calls. View all of the digitized Presidential Daily Diaries from Roosevelt onward.

Researchers can search archival records through the National Archives Catalog.

In addition, each Library also has a website that contains information regarding their holdings including finding aids and collection guides. If finding aids are not available online, researchers can contact the Library, for more information on the materials available for research.

Museum Information

Are the museums of the Presidential Libraries open to the general public?

Presidential Libraries and Museums with permanent facilities are open to the general public of all ages. NARA's Presidential Museums document the life and times of its respective President.

Each Presidential Museum charges an admission fee, with revenues going to support museum operations and programs.

The museums also host changing exhibits about particular topics relating to American history and the American experience and are open to the public year-round.

Many Libraries also have an active education component, providing programs geared specifically to students and teachers and often tied to local curricula.

How many people visit the Presidential Library Museums?

Below is the count of visitors to the museum at the Presidential Libraries from fiscal year 2019 through 2022. The federal government's fiscal year runs from October 1-September 30.

Through the Passport to Presidential Libraries program, visitors can purchase a special keepsake booklet to take with them on their travels to Presidential Libraries across the nation. Visitors receive a commemorative stamp from the Library at the time of the purchase and can collect stamps from every Presidential Library visited in the future. Once they collect stamps from all Presidential Libraries, they may visit any of the Presidential Libraries for a special gift.

How do I get my Passport stamped?

Stamps are available at each Library's admissions desk and/or museum store. We unfortunately cannot retroactively stamp Passports or accept Passports via mail for stamping purposes.

Who can I call with questions about the Passport?

Please direct all inquiries and feedback regarding the Passport to Presidential Libraries to the Office of Presidential Libraries at (301) 837-3250.

Funding

How is a Presidential Library funded?

A Presidential Library is constructed with private or non-Federal funds donated to non-profit organizations typically established for the express purpose of building a Presidential Library and supporting its programs.

Some Libraries have also received construction and development funding from state and/or local governments or university partners.

The Library is then transferred to the Federal Government and operated and maintained by NARA through its congressionally appropriated operating budget.

Some staff and programs at Presidential Libraries are paid for with funds from associated private presidential foundations. These private foundations also provide continuing support for Library programs and special events, such as conferences and exhibitions.

What is the role of a Presidential Library foundation?

Presidential Libraries carry out a mandated program to preserve, process, and make available their archival holdings. As part of providing access, the Libraries and Museums provide outreach and educational programs.

Presidential foundations also provide financial support to ensure the broadest spectrum of innovative and insightful public, education, and information programs at each Library.

Presidential Libraries and Museums, their websites, and the scholarship they promote benefit in significant ways from private organizations established to support such programs.

In several cases, these organizations evolved from bodies chartered to raise money and construct the original Library building. In other instances, these organizations were formed after the dedication of the Library by friends of the President.

Also, it should be noted that, starting with the George Bush Library, all Presidential Library foundations funding a NARA facility must provide an endowment to NARA to help offset facility operating expenses. This endowment is presented to NARA and is used by the government to support facility maintenance needs.

Why should taxpayers support Presidential Libraries?

NARAÃ¢ÂÂs mission is to serve American democracy by safeguarding and preserving the records of our Government, ensuring that everyone can discover, use, and learn from this documentary heritage. We ensure continuing access to the essential documentation of the rights of American citizens and the actions of their government. We support democracy, promote civic education, and facilitate historical understanding of our national experience.

Presidential Libraries support NARAÃ¢ÂÂs mission by preserving and providing access to materials from a crucial part of our government as well as materials from individuals who have played key roles in our government. The papers and records created by, for, or about Presidents, Vice Presidents, and their administrations document the key decisions, policy and activities of the institution of the Presidency - the highest policy level of government. The documents and artifacts held by the Presidential Libraries not only inform society about the President as an individual and about his term in office, but also provide insights into the American experience.

We provide access to these holdings through our research rooms, our exhibits, and online in order to reach the broadest audience possible. We also draw on the many partnerships formed between NARA and the Presidential Library foundations. As a result, many aspects of museum and public programs are, in fact, supported by private funds, although they are overseen by government professionals including curators, educators, and archivists.

Building Details

Who decides where a Presidential Library and Museum should be located?

The President, with advice from the Archivist of the United States, makes the decision about the location of his Presidential Library. In consultation with his family, friends, and associates, the President usually selects from a series of proposals submitted by interested communities or universities.

Presidents have often acknowledged their origins by placing their Libraries in their hometowns. However, in some cases Presidents place their Libraries on or near a university campus. For example, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum is located on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin.

Does NARA have any input into the decision on location or the kind of building the Presidential Library will be?

The former President or his representatives choose the architects, or an architectural firm/design team for the building of a Presidential Library and for the development and fabrication of museum exhibits. The President or his representatives are solely responsible for choice of the final location for the Library building and for the construction costs.

The Presidential Libraries Act (44 U.S.C. Section 2112 (a) (2)) requires the Archivist of the United States to establish architectural and design standards that apply to new and existing libraries Ã¢ÂÂin order to ensure that such depositories (A) preserve Presidential records subject to Chapter 22 of 44 U.S.C. and papers and other historical materials accepted for deposit under section 2111 of 44 U.S.C. (B) contain adequate research facilities.Ã¢ÂÂ

The Architectural and Design Standards for Presidential Libraries are a supplement to NARA directive 1571, Archival Storage Standards, and NARA provides the standards for Presidential Libraries to the architects and design team selected by the former President or his representatives.

View the current Architecture and Design Standards for Presidential Libraries.

Are there any limits to the size of Presidential Library buildings?

Though not specifically limiting the size of Presidential Libraries, the Presidential Libraries Act of 1986 mandates that Library foundations must provide an endowment to NARA upon acceptance of the Library facility by the Archivist of the United States. The size of this endowment is based in part on the size of the facility.

The requirement of a significant increase in the endowment for facilities over 70,000 square feet has had the practical effect of limiting the size of newer Libraries to less than 70,000 square feet.

How big are the Presidential Libraries?

The Presidential Libraries are most often buildings or series of buildings managed by the National Archives and Records Administration and a presidential library foundation.

Below are the size of the buildings under the management of the National Archives and Records Administration. This data is provided by the General Services Administration in their Federal Real Property Profile and will be updated accordingly.

Holdings

What is housed in a Presidential Library?

A Presidential Library is a rich resource for a particular President and his administration, as well as for the times in which he lived.

The papers and records created by a President and his administration, as well as the materials created by a President during his life and career comprise the core holdings of all Presidential Libraries.

The papers and records document the personal and professional lives of a President, his family, close friends, and business and political associates, revealing the details about White House activities, a PresidentÃ¢ÂÂ s career, and a PresidentÃ¢ÂÂ s personal life.

Along with the papers and records, a Presidential Library contains thousands of films and video as well as millions of still pictures revealing all aspects of a President's life before, during, and after the White House. This rich resource of audiovisual materials may include home movies, official White House photographs, and audiotapes of Presidential conversations.

Modern Presidential Libraries are also the custodians of the electronic records generated by a Presidential administration in its carrying out of the constitutional, statutory, and ceremonial duties of the Presidency.

Additionally, a Presidential Library contains thousands of artifacts, the objects that document a life and career. Whether a gift from a foreign head of state or a cherished childhood memento, the artifacts provide a unique record of a President's life, in and out of the public eye.

NARA has a statutory obligation to care for and provide access to legally defined Presidential records as a result of the Presidential Records Act of 1978. This law vested the ownership and administration of Presidential records with the United States Government through NARA. This law applies to the core holdings of Presidential Libraries starting with the records from the administration of Ronald Reagan.

The holdings of the Presidential Libraries differ from the materials created by all executive branch agencies, the United States District and Circuit Courts, and Legislative branch agencies. The Federal Records Act provides the statutory framework NARA uses to determine what records from these agencies should be accessioned into the holdings of the National Archives.

Where are the materials of Presidents before Herbert Hoover?

Although Franklin D. Roosevelt established the first Presidential Library, his predecessor, Herbert Hoover, later established a Presidential Library in West Branch, Iowa.

The materials of Presidents prior to Herbert Hoover are dispersed throughout the nation. Some are held by universities and historical societies, but a large quantity are held by the Library of Congress. The Other Places to Research Presidential Materials page is an excellent starting point to finding information on other presidents.

Unfortunately, the extent of Presidential materials in archival and historical institutions across the country varies considerably depending on the attitudes of the former Presidents, their families, and friends to the preservation of their documentary materials. Many materials were lost, purposefully destroyed, or dispersed to family, friends, and supporters.

How many records do all the Presidential Libraries hold and how many of those are open to researchers?

Below are the holding counts for each of the Presidential Libraries as of 2022. Please note that collections change over time as new donations are added; those changes will be updated on this page.

As of September 30, 2016, approximately 238,000 cubic feet, or 88% of the nearly than 270,000 cubic feet of textual and non-textual holdings in the Presidential Libraries have been processed. The percentage of materials processed at the individual Libraries tend to follow a chronological trend.

At the Presidential Libraries we refer to records that are processed and available to researchers as being open. The older Libraries (Hoover, Roosevelt, and Truman) each have processed more than 90% of their holdings, the middle Libraries (Eisenhower through Carter) have each processed more than half their holdings for public access, and the most recent Libraries (from Reagan forward) have processed less than 50% of their holdings.

Do NARA's architectural and design standards for Presidential Libraries apply to the Presidential Centers, such as the Obama Presidential Center?

The Obama Presidential Center is not part of the Presidential Library system. NARA's requirements apply only to the extent the privately owned and operated museum intends to borrow records and artifacts from NARA for display. Those requirements support the preservation and security of loaned items and apply to any museum or other facility that borrows items from NARA.

What are the key statutes governing the establishment and operation of a Presidential Library?

Though Congress approved the acceptance of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum by the National Archives in 1939, the nation's legislative branch did not formally authorize the Presidential Library System until 1955 with the passage of the Presidential Libraries Act.

The Presidential Libraries Act of 1955 codified the acceptance, in the name of the United States, of land, buildings, and equipment for the purposes of creating a Presidential archival depository, as well as the role of the National Archives in maintaining, operating, and protecting them as a Presidential archival depository.

The act was amended in 1986, establishing a limit of 70,000 square feet for the Presidential Library facility that will be provided to the government and a requirement for an endowment to offset the maintenance costs of the facility. The most recent update to the act set the endowment requirement for future Presidential Libraries at 60 percent of the overall initial cost of the facility.

What is a deed of gift?

A deed of gift is a legal document between a donor and an archival repository.

Prior to the passage of the Presidential Records Act in 1978, the documentary materials created by a President and his staff during an administration were considered the President's personal property to be disposed of as he desired.

Presidents Herbert Hoover through Jimmy Carter (with the exception of Richard Nixon) donated their Presidential papers to NARA through deed of gift agreements.

Deeds of gift include restrictions of materials for national security and invasion of privacy reasons.

What is the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act?

As a result of the abuses of governmental power commonly known as ""Watergate"" and the controversy that occurred over the disposition of the Nixon tapes and papers documenting these abuses, Congress passed the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (PRMPA) in 1974. PRMPA transferred ownership of the Presidential historical materials of Richard Nixon to the Federal government, deposited them with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and specified access restrictions to these materials.

The act also called for a commission to study and make recommendations regarding the status of the papers of all Federal officials, including those of the President. The findings of this study led to the Presidential Records Act of 1978, vesting ownership of the official records of the President and Vice President with the Federal government after January 20, 1981."	1
222	"UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.

The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.

Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking Ã¢ÂÂout of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,Ã¢ÂÂ according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.

Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.

Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.

Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a Ã¢ÂÂsanctuary countyÃ¢ÂÂ in May 2014. The county only cooperates with Ã¢ÂÂICE holdsÃ¢ÂÂ if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. GonzalezÃ¢ÂÂs immigration status has not yet been announced.

The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of Ã¢ÂÂunreasonable searches and seizuresÃ¢ÂÂ under the U.S. ConstitutionÃ¢ÂÂs Fourth Amendment.

The Sonoma County Sheriff DepartmentÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ1.0 Policy StatementÃ¢ÂÂ reads: Ã¢ÂÂNo person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.Ã¢ÂÂ The policy adds that Ã¢ÂÂthe immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which SheriffÃ¢ÂÂs Office personnel execute their duties.Ã¢ÂÂ

According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.

Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated Ã¢ÂÂ about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion."	1
223	"ItÃ¢ÂÂs absolutely clear that the Clinton Foundation has faced some honest reports of stealing from impoverished Haitians devastated in the 2008 Hurricane Hanna, and straight through their own foundation. For years the Haitians have been struggling and protesting outside the Clinton Foundation offices over the robbery. The money taken was donated by the individuals and business directly to the Clinton Foundation, thinking they were going to receive aid. However, the opposite it true. The money never even made it to the poorest of the poor. Now we have one man ready to testify against the corrupt Clinton Foundation in the upcoming week. However, the 50 year old man, a former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein, was found dead in his Miami home with a Ã¢ÂÂgunshot to the headÃ¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs been ruled a Ã¢ÂÂsuicideÃ¢ÂÂ by the Miami-DadeÃ¢ÂÂs medical examiner records supervisor.

Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.

Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.

Eberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton FoundationÃ¢ÂÂs activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs economic development agency, Fonds dÃ¢ÂÂassistance ÃÂ©conomique et social, for three years. According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% Ã¢ÂÂ or $5.4 billion Ã¢ÂÂ was funneled to non-Haitian organizations.

Ã¢ÂÂThe Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,Ã¢ÂÂ Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year.

The former director general of Haiti, who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and even has a pizza Ã¢ÂÂ the Klaus Special Ã¢ÂÂ named after him.

According to the Haiti Libre newspaper, Eberwein was said to be in Ã¢ÂÂgood spiritsÃ¢ÂÂ, with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide.

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs really shocking,Ã¢ÂÂ said MuncheezÃ¢ÂÂs owner Gilbert Bailly. Ã¢ÂÂWe grew up together; he was like family.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂYour News Wire

Americans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016, former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit, candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.

Sansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to Ã¢ÂÂsideÃ¢ÂÂ with the Clinton Administration and he would Ã¢ÂÂbe the richest man in Haiti.Ã¢ÂÂ

He also demanded that Hillary Clinton Ã¢ÂÂdisclose the audit of all moneyÃ¢ÂÂ related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation.

Ã¢ÂÂNot even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you. Ask Hillary Clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti.Ã¢ÂÂ

12:35 P.M. EDT



THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Please have a seat. Well, good afternoon, and thank you to Dean Singleton and the board of the Associated Press for inviting me here today. It is a pleasure to speak to all of you -- and to have a microphone that I can see. (Laughter.) Feel free to transmit any of this to Vladimir if you see him. (Laughter.)

Clearly, weÃ¢ÂÂre already in the beginning months of another long, lively election year. There will be gaffes and minor controversies, be hot mics and Etch-a-Sketch moments. You will cover every word that we say, and we will complain vociferously about the unflattering words that you write -- unless, of course, you're writing about the other guy -- in which case, good job. (Laughter.)

But there are also big, fundamental issues at stake right now -- issues that deserve serious debate among every candidate, and serious coverage among every reporter. Whoever he may be, the next President will inherit an economy that is recovering, but not yet recovered, from the worst economic calamity since the Great Depression. Too many Americans will still be looking for a job that pays enough to cover their bills or their mortgage. Too many citizens will still lack the sort of financial security that started slipping away years before this recession hit. A debt that has grown over the last decade, primarily as a result of two wars, two massive tax cuts, and an unprecedented financial crisis, will have to be paid down.

In the face of all these challenges, we're going to have to answer a central question as a nation: What, if anything, can we do to restore a sense of security for people who are willing to work hard and act responsibly in this country? Can we succeed as a country where a shrinking number of people do exceedingly well, while a growing number struggle to get by? Or are we better off when everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules?

This is not just another run-of-the-mill political debate. IÃ¢ÂÂve said itÃ¢ÂÂs the defining issue of our time, and I believe it. ItÃ¢ÂÂs why I ran in 2008. ItÃ¢ÂÂs what my presidency has been about. ItÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂm running again. I believe this is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and I canÃ¢ÂÂt remember a time when the choice between competing visions of our future has been so unambiguously clear.

Keep in mind, I have never been somebody who believes that government can or should try to solve every problem. Some of you know my first job in Chicago was working with a group of Catholic churches that often did more good for the people in their communities than any government program could. In those same communities I saw that no education policy, however well crafted, can take the place of a parentÃ¢ÂÂs love and attention.

As President, IÃ¢ÂÂve eliminated dozens of programs that werenÃ¢ÂÂt working, and announced over 500 regulatory reforms that will save businesses and taxpayers billions, and put annual domestic spending on a path to become the smallest share of the economy since Dwight Eisenhower held this office -- since before I was born. I know that the true engine of job creation in this country is the private sector, not Washington, which is why IÃ¢ÂÂve cut taxes for small business owners 17 times over the last three years.

So I believe deeply that the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history. My mother and the grandparents who raised me instilled the values of self-reliance and personal responsibility that remain the cornerstone of the American idea. But I also share the belief of our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln -- a belief that, through government, we should do together what we cannot do as well for ourselves.

That belief is the reason this country has been able to build a strong military to keep us safe, and public schools to educate our children. That belief is why weÃ¢ÂÂve been able to lay down railroads and highways to facilitate travel and commerce. That belief is why weÃ¢ÂÂve been able to support the work of scientists and researchers whose discoveries have saved lives, and unleashed repeated technological revolutions, and led to countless new jobs and entire industries.

That belief is also why weÃ¢ÂÂve sought to ensure that every citizen can count on some basic measure of security. We do this because we recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, at any moment, might face hard times, might face bad luck, might face a crippling illness or a layoff. And so we contribute to programs like Medicare and Social Security, which guarantee health care and a source of income after a lifetime of hard work. We provide unemployment insurance, which protects us against unexpected job loss and facilitates the labor mobility that makes our economy so dynamic. We provide for Medicaid, which makes sure that millions of seniors in nursing homes and children with disabilities are getting the care that they need.

For generations, nearly all of these investments -- from transportation to education to retirement programs -- have been supported by people in both parties. As much as we might associate the G.I. Bill with Franklin Roosevelt, or Medicare with Lyndon Johnson, it was a Republican, Lincoln, who launched the Transcontinental Railroad, the National Academy of Sciences, land grant colleges. It was Eisenhower who launched the Interstate Highway System and new investment in scientific research. It was Richard Nixon who created the Environmental Protection Agency, Ronald Reagan who worked with Democrats to save Social Security. It was George W. Bush who added prescription drug coverage to Medicare.



What leaders in both parties have traditionally understood is that these investments arenÃ¢ÂÂt part of some scheme to redistribute wealth from one group to another. They are expressions of the fact that we are one nation. These investments benefit us all. They contribute to genuine, durable economic growth.

Show me a business leader who wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt profit if more Americans could afford to get the skills and education that todayÃ¢ÂÂs jobs require. Ask any company where theyÃ¢ÂÂd rather locate and hire workers Ã¢ÂÂ- a country with crumbling roads and bridges, or one thatÃ¢ÂÂs committed to high-speed Internet and high-speed railroads and high-tech research and development?

It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt make us weaker when we guarantee basic security for the elderly or the sick or those who are actively looking for work. What makes us weaker is when fewer and fewer people can afford to buy the goods and services our businesses sell, or when entrepreneurs donÃ¢ÂÂt have the financial security to take a chance and start a new business. What drags down our entire economy is when thereÃ¢ÂÂs an ever-widening chasm between the ultra-rich and everybody else.

In this country, broad-based prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few. It has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle class. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs how a generation who went to college on the G.I. Bill, including my grandfather, helped build the most prosperous economy the world has ever known. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why a CEO like Henry Ford made it his mission to pay his workers enough so they could buy the cars that they made. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why research has shown that countries with less inequality tend to have stronger and steadier economic growth over the long run.

And yet, for much of the last century, we have been having the same argument with folks who keep peddling some version of trickle-down economics. They keep telling us that if weÃ¢ÂÂd convert more of our investments in education and research and health care into tax cuts -- especially for the wealthy -- our economy will grow stronger. They keep telling us that if weÃ¢ÂÂd just strip away more regulations, and let businesses pollute more and treat workers and consumers with impunity, that somehow weÃ¢ÂÂd all be better off. WeÃ¢ÂÂre told that when the wealthy become even wealthier, and corporations are allowed to maximize their profits by whatever means necessary, itÃ¢ÂÂs good for America, and that their success will automatically translate into more jobs and prosperity for everybody else. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the theory.

Now, the problem for advocates of this theory is that weÃ¢ÂÂve tried their approach -- on a massive scale. The results of their experiment are there for all to see. At the beginning of the last decade, the wealthiest Americans received a huge tax cut in 2001 and another huge tax cut in 2003. We were promised that these tax cuts would lead to faster job growth. They did not. The wealthy got wealthier -- we would expect that. The income of the top 1 percent has grown by more than 275 percent over the last few decades, to an average of $1.3 million a year. But prosperity sure didn't trickle down.

Instead, during the last decade, we had the slowest job growth in half a century. And the typical American family actually saw their incomes fall by about 6 percent, even as the economy was growing.

It was a period when insurance companies and mortgage lenders and financial institutions didnÃ¢ÂÂt have to abide by strong enough regulations, or they found their ways around them. And what was the result? Profits for many of these companies soared. But so did peopleÃ¢ÂÂs health insurance premiums. Patients were routinely denied care, often when they needed it most. Families were enticed, and sometimes just plain tricked, into buying homes they couldnÃ¢ÂÂt afford. Huge, reckless bets were made with other peopleÃ¢ÂÂs money on the line. And our entire financial system was nearly destroyed.

So we tried this theory out. And you would think that after the results of this experiment in trickle-down economics, after the results were made painfully clear, that the proponents of this theory might show some humility, might moderate their views a bit. You'd think theyÃ¢ÂÂd say, you know what, maybe some rules and regulations are necessary to protect the economy and prevent people from being taken advantage of by insurance companies or credit card companies or mortgage lenders. Maybe, just maybe, at a time of growing debt and widening inequality, we should hold off on giving the wealthiest Americans another round of big tax cuts. Maybe when we know that most of todayÃ¢ÂÂs middle-class jobs require more than a high school degree, we shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt gut education, or lay off thousands of teachers, or raise interest rates on college loans, or take away peopleÃ¢ÂÂs financial aid.

But thatÃ¢ÂÂs exactly the opposite of what theyÃ¢ÂÂve done. Instead of moderating their views even slightly, the Republicans running Congress right now have doubled down, and proposed a budget so far to the right it makes the Contract with America look like the New Deal. (Laughter.) In fact, that renowned liberal, Newt Gingrich, first called the original version of the budget ""radical"" and said it would contribute to ""right-wing social engineering."" This is coming from Newt Gingrich.



And yet, this isnÃ¢ÂÂt a budget supported by some small rump group in the Republican Party. This is now the partyÃ¢ÂÂs governing platform. This is what theyÃ¢ÂÂre running on. One of my potential opponents, Governor Romney, has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last year would be introduced as a bill on day one of his presidency. He said that heÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂvery supportiveÃ¢ÂÂ of this new budget, and he even called it ""marvelous"" -- which is a word you donÃ¢ÂÂt often hear when it comes to describing a budget. (Laughter.) ItÃ¢ÂÂs a word you donÃ¢ÂÂt often hear generally. (Laughter.)

So hereÃ¢ÂÂs what this ""marvelous"" budget does. Back in the summer, I came to an agreement with Republicans in Congress to cut roughly $1 trillion in annual spending. Some of these cuts were about getting rid of waste; others were about programs that we support but just canÃ¢ÂÂt afford given our deficits and our debt. And part of the agreement was a guarantee of another trillion in savings, for a total of about $2 trillion in deficit reduction.

This new House Republican budget, however, breaks our bipartisan agreement and proposes massive new cuts in annual domestic spending Ã¢ÂÂ- exactly the area where weÃ¢ÂÂve already cut the most. And I want to actually go through what it would mean for our country if these cuts were to be spread out evenly. So bear with me. I want to go through this -- because I donÃ¢ÂÂt think people fully appreciate the nature of this budget.

The year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each. There would be 1,600 fewer medical grants, research grants for things like AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs and cancer and AIDS. There would be 4,000 fewer scientific research grants, eliminating support for 48,000 researchers, students, and teachers. Investments in clean energy technologies that are helping us reduce our dependence on foreign oil would be cut by nearly a fifth.

If this budget becomes law and the cuts were applied evenly, starting in 2014, over 200,000 children would lose their chance to get an early education in the Head Start program. Two million mothers and young children would be cut from a program that gives them access to healthy food. There would be 4,500 fewer federal grants at the Department of Justice and the FBI to combat violent crime, financial crime, and help secure our borders. Hundreds of national parks would be forced to close for part or all of the year. We wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have the capacity to enforce the laws that protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, or the food that we eat.

Cuts to the FAA would likely result in more flight cancellations, delays, and the complete elimination of air traffic control services in parts of the country. Over time, our weather forecasts would become less accurate because we wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be able to afford to launch new satellites. And that means governors and mayors would have to wait longer to order evacuations in the event of a hurricane.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs just a partial sampling of the consequences of this budget. Now, you can anticipate Republicans may say, well, weÃ¢ÂÂll avoid some of these cuts -- since they donÃ¢ÂÂt specify exactly the cuts that they would make. But they can only avoid some of these cuts if they cut even deeper in other areas. This is math. If they want to make smaller cuts to medical research that means theyÃ¢ÂÂve got to cut even deeper in funding for things like teaching and law enforcement. The converse is true as well. If they want to protect early childhood education, it will mean further reducing things like financial aid for young people trying to afford college.

Perhaps they will never tell us where the knife will fall -- but you can be sure that with cuts this deep, there is no secret plan or formula that will be able to protect the investments we need to help our economy grow.

This is not conjecture. I am not exaggerating. These are facts. And these are just the cuts that would happen the year after next.

If this budget became law, by the middle of the century, funding for the kinds of things I just mentioned would have to be cut by about 95 percent. Let me repeat that. Those categories I just mentioned we would have to cut by 95 percent. As a practical matter, the federal budget would basically amount to whatever is left in entitlements, defense spending, and interest on the national debt -- period. Money for these investments that have traditionally been supported on a bipartisan basis would be practically eliminated.

And the same is true for other priorities like transportation, and homeland security, and veterans programs for the men and women who have risked their lives for this country. This is not an exaggeration. Check it out yourself.

And this is to say nothing about what the budget does to health care. WeÃ¢ÂÂre told that Medicaid would simply be handed over to the states -- that's the pitch: Let's get it out of the central bureaucracy. The states can experiment. They'll be able to run the programs a lot better. But here's the deal the states would be getting. They would have to be running these programs in the face of the largest cut to Medicaid that has ever been proposed -- a cut that, according to one nonpartisan group, would take away health care for about 19 million Americans -- 19 million.

Who are these Americans? Many are someoneÃ¢ÂÂs grandparents who, without Medicaid, won't be able to afford nursing home care without Medicaid. Many are poor children. Some are middle-class families who have children with autism or DownÃ¢ÂÂs Syndrome. Some are kids with disabilities so severe that they require 24-hour care. These are the people who count on Medicaid.

Then thereÃ¢ÂÂs Medicare. Because health care costs keep rising and the Baby Boom generation is retiring, Medicare, we all know, is one of the biggest drivers of our long-term deficit. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a challenge we have to meet by bringing down the cost of health care overall so that seniors and taxpayers can share in the savings.

But hereÃ¢ÂÂs the solution proposed by the Republicans in Washington, and embraced by most of their candidates for president: Instead of being enrolled in Medicare when they turn 65, seniors who retire a decade from now would get a voucher that equals the cost of the second cheapest health care plan in their area. If Medicare is more expensive than that private plan, theyÃ¢ÂÂll have to pay more if they want to enroll in traditional Medicare. If health care costs rise faster than the amount of the voucher -- as, by the way, theyÃ¢ÂÂve been doing for decades -- thatÃ¢ÂÂs too bad. Seniors bear the risk. If the voucher isnÃ¢ÂÂt enough to buy a private plan with the specific doctors and care that you need, that's too bad.

So most experts will tell you the way this voucher plan encourages savings is not through better care at cheaper cost. The way these private insurance companies save money is by designing and marketing plans to attract the youngest and healthiest seniors -- cherry-picking -- leaving the older and sicker seniors in traditional Medicare, where they have access to a wide range of doctors and guaranteed care. But that, of course, makes the traditional Medicare program even more expensive, and raise premiums even further.

The net result is that our country will end up spending more on health care, and the only reason the government will save any money -- it wonÃ¢ÂÂt be on our books -- is because weÃ¢ÂÂve shifted it to seniors. TheyÃ¢ÂÂll bear more of the costs themselves. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a bad idea, and it will ultimately end Medicare as we know it.

Now, the proponents of this budget will tell us we have to make all these draconian cuts because our deficit is so large; this is an existential crisis, we have to think about future generations, so on and so on. And that argument might have a shred of credibility were it not for their proposal to also spend $4.6 trillion over the next decade on lower tax rates.

WeÃ¢ÂÂre told that these tax cuts will supposedly be paid for by closing loopholes and eliminating wasteful deductions. But the Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close. Not one. And by the way, there is no way to get even close to $4.6 trillion in savings without dramatically reducing all kinds of tax breaks that go to middle-class families -- tax breaks for health care, tax breaks for retirement, tax breaks for homeownership.

Meanwhile, these proposed tax breaks would come on top of more than a trillion dollars in tax giveaways for people making more than $250,000 a year. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs an average of at least $150,000 for every millionaire in this country -- $150,000.

LetÃ¢ÂÂs just step back for a second and look at what $150,000 pays for: A yearÃ¢ÂÂs worth of prescription drug coverage for a senior citizen. Plus a new school computer lab. Plus a year of medical care for a returning veteran. Plus a medical research grant for a chronic disease. Plus a yearÃ¢ÂÂs salary for a firefighter or police officer. Plus a tax credit to make a year of college more affordable. Plus a yearÃ¢ÂÂs worth of financial aid. One hundred fifty thousand dollars could pay for all of these things combined -- investments in education and research that are essential to economic growth that benefits all of us. For $150,000, that would be going to each millionaire and billionaire in this country. This budget says weÃ¢ÂÂd be better off as a country if thatÃ¢ÂÂs how we spend it.

This is supposed to be about paying down our deficit? ItÃ¢ÂÂs laughable.

The bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission that I created -- which the Republicans originally were for until I was for it -- that was about paying down the deficit. And I didnÃ¢ÂÂt agree with all the details. I proposed about $600 billion more in revenue and $600 billion -- I'm sorry -- it proposed about $600 billion more in revenue and about $600 billion more in defense cuts than I proposed in my own budget. But Bowles-Simpson was a serious, honest, balanced effort between Democrats and Republicans to bring down the deficit. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why, although it differs in some ways, my budget takes a similarly balanced approach: Cuts in discretionary spending, cuts in mandatory spending, increased revenue.

This congressional Republican budget is something different altogether. It is a Trojan Horse. Disguised as deficit reduction plans, it is really an attempt to impose a radical vision on our country. It is thinly veiled social Darwinism. It is antithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everybody whoÃ¢ÂÂs willing to work for it; a place where prosperity doesnÃ¢ÂÂt trickle down from the top, but grows outward from the heart of the middle class. And by gutting the very things we need to grow an economy thatÃ¢ÂÂs built to last -- education and training, research and development, our infrastructure -- it is a prescription for decline.

And everybody here should understand that because there's very few people here who haven't benefitted at some point from those investments that were made in the '50s and the '60s and the '70s and the '80s. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs part of how we got ahead. And now, we're going to be pulling up those ladders up for the next generation?

So in the months ahead, I will be fighting as hard as I know how for this truer vision of what the United States of America is all about. Absolutely, we have to get serious about the deficit. And that will require tough choices and sacrifice. And IÃ¢ÂÂve already shown myself willing to make these tough choices when I signed into law the biggest spending cut of any President in recent memory. In fact, if you adjust for the economy, the Congressional Budget Office says the overall spending next year will be lower than any year under Ronald Reagan.

And IÃ¢ÂÂm willing to make more of those difficult spending decisions in the months ahead. But IÃ¢ÂÂve said it before and IÃ¢ÂÂll say it again -- there has to be some balance. All of us have to do our fair share.

IÃ¢ÂÂve also put forward a detailed plan that would reform and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid. By the beginning of the next decade, it achieves the same amount of annual health savings as the plan proposed by Simpson-Bowles -- the Simpson-Bowles commission, and it does so by making changes that people in my party havenÃ¢ÂÂt always been comfortable with. But instead of saving money by shifting costs to seniors, like the congressional Republican plan proposes, our approach would lower the cost of health care throughout the entire system. It goes after excessive subsidies to prescription drug companies. It gets more efficiency out of Medicaid without gutting the program. It asks the very wealthiest seniors to pay a little bit more. It changes the way we pay for health care -- not by procedure or the number of days spent in a hospital, but with new incentives for doctors and hospitals to improve their results.

And it slows the growth of Medicare costs by strengthening an independent commission -- a commission not made up of bureaucrats from government or insurance companies, but doctors and nurses and medical experts and consumers, who will look at all the evidence and recommend the best way to reduce unnecessary health care spending while protecting access to the care that the seniors need.

We also have a much different approach when it comes to taxes -- an approach that says if weÃ¢ÂÂre serious about paying down our debt, we canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to spend trillions more on tax cuts for folks like me, for wealthy Americans who donÃ¢ÂÂt need them and werenÃ¢ÂÂt even asking for them, and that the country cannot afford. At a time when the share of national income flowing to the top 1 percent of people in this country has climbed to levels last seen in the 1920s, those same folks are paying taxes at one of the lowest rates in 50 years. As both I and Warren Buffett have pointed out many times now, heÃ¢ÂÂs paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. That is not fair. It is not right.

And the choice is really very simple. If you want to keep these tax rates and deductions in place -- or give even more tax breaks to the wealthy, as the Republicans in Congress propose -- then one of two things happen: Either it means higher deficits, or it means more sacrifice from the middle class. Seniors will have to pay more for Medicare. College students will lose some of their financial aid. Working families who are scraping by will have to do more because the richest Americans are doing less. I repeat what IÃ¢ÂÂve said before: That is not class warfare, that is not class envy, that is math.

If thatÃ¢ÂÂs the choice that members of Congress want to make, then weÃ¢ÂÂre going to make sure every American knows about it. In a few weeks, there will be a vote on what weÃ¢ÂÂve called the Buffett Rule. Simple concept: If you make more than a million dollars a year -- not that you have a million dollars -- if you make more than a million dollars annually, then you should pay at least the same percentage of your income in taxes as middle-class families do. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year -- like 98 percent of American families do -- then your taxes shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt go up. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the proposal.

Now, youÃ¢ÂÂll hear some people point out that the Buffett Rule alone wonÃ¢ÂÂt raise enough revenue to solve our deficit problems. Maybe not, but itÃ¢ÂÂs definitely a step in the right direction. And I intend to keep fighting for this kind of balance and fairness until the other side starts listening, because I believe this is what the American people want. I believe this is the best way to pay for the investments we need to grow our economy and strengthen the middle class. And by the way, I believe itÃ¢ÂÂs the right thing to do.

This larger debate that we will be having and that you will be covering in the coming year about the size and role of government, this debate has been with us since our founding days. And during moments of great challenge and change, like the ones that weÃ¢ÂÂre living through now, the debate gets sharper; it gets more vigorous. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a good thing. As a country that prizes both our individual freedom and our obligations to one another, this is one of the most important debates that we can have.

But no matter what we argue or where we stand, we have always held certain beliefs as Americans. We believe that in order to preserve our own freedoms and pursue our own happiness, we canÃ¢ÂÂt just think about ourselves. We have to think about the country that made those liberties possible. We have to think about our fellow citizens with whom we share a community. We have to think about whatÃ¢ÂÂs required to preserve the American Dream for future generations.

And this sense of responsibility -- to each other and our country -- this isnÃ¢ÂÂt a partisan feeling. This isnÃ¢ÂÂt a Democratic or Republican idea. ItÃ¢ÂÂs patriotism. And if we keep that in mind, and uphold our obligations to one another and to this larger enterprise that is America, then I have no doubt that we will continue our long and prosperous journey as the greatest nation on Earth.

Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you.

MR. SINGLETON: Thank you, Mr. President. We appreciate so much you being with us today. I have some questions from the audience, which I will ask -- and I'll be more careful than I was last time I did this.

Republicans have been sharply critical of your budget ideas as well. What can you say to the Americans who just want both sides to stop fighting and get some work done on their behalf?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I completely understand the American peopleÃ¢ÂÂs frustrations, because the truth is that these are eminently solvable problems. I know that Christine Lagarde is here from the IMF, and sheÃ¢ÂÂs looking at the books of a lot of other countries around the world. The kinds of challenges they face fiscally are so much more severe than anything that we confront -- if we make some sensible decisions.

So the American peopleÃ¢ÂÂs impulses are absolutely right. These are solvable problems if people of good faith came together and were willing to compromise. The challenge we have right now is that we have on one side, a party that will brook no compromise. And this is not just my assertion. We had presidential candidates who stood on a stage and were asked, Ã¢ÂÂWould you accept a budget package, a deficit reduction plan, that involved $10 of cuts for every dollar in revenue increases?Ã¢ÂÂ Ten-to-one ratio of spending cuts to revenue. Not one of them raised their hand.

Think about that. Ronald Reagan, who, as I recall, is not accused of being a tax-and-spend socialist, understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get out of control, that for him to make a deal he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases. Did it multiple times. He could not get through a Republican primary today.

So let's look at Bowles-Simpson. Essentially, my differences with Bowles-Simpson were I actually proposed less revenue and slightly lower defense spending cuts. The Republicans want to increase defense spending and take in no revenue, which makes it impossible to balance the deficit under the terms that Bowles-Simpson laid out -- unless you essentially eliminate discretionary spending. You don't just cut discretionary spending. Everything we think of as being pretty important -- from education to basic science and research to transportation spending to national parks to environmental protection -- we'd essentially have to eliminate.

I guess another way of thinking about this is -- and this bears on your reporting. I think that there is oftentimes the impulse to suggest that if the two parties are disagreeing, then they're equally at fault and the truth lies somewhere in the middle, and an equivalence is presented -- which reinforces I think people's cynicism about Washington generally. This is not one of those situations where there's an equivalence. I've got some of the most liberal Democrats in Congress who were prepared to make significant changes to entitlements that go against their political interests, and who said they were willing to do it. And we couldn't get a Republican to stand up and say, we'll raise some revenue, or even to suggest that we won't give more tax cuts to people who don't need them.

And so I think it's important to put the current debate in some historical context. It's not just true, by the way, of the budget. It's true of a lot of the debates that we're having out here.

Cap and trade was originally proposed by conservatives and Republicans as a market-based solution to solving environmental problems. The first President to talk about cap and trade was George H.W. Bush. Now you've got the other party essentially saying we shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt even be thinking about environmental protection; let's gut the EPA.

Health care, which is in the news right now -- there's a reason why there's a little bit of confusion in the Republican primary about health care and the individual mandate since it originated as a conservative idea to preserve the private marketplace in health care while still assuring that everybody got covered, in contrast to a single-payer p"	0

CNN Live Event/Special

Democratic Candidates Compassion Forum

Aired April 13, 2008 - 20:00 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



BROWN: Good evening, everybody, to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Welcome to Messiah College in Grantham, Pennsylvania. I'm Campbell Brown.

Tonight, we bring you something different in this already extraordinary campaign year. We are calling it the Compassion Forum, an evening with the Democratic presidential candidates to focus on the issues of faith and compassion and how a president's faith can affect us all.



The focus tonight is to take the conversation beyond the candidate's standard policy points. And some of these questions tonight will be deeply personal.



We are here before a distinguished, bipartisan audience of faith leaders from around the country, from the head of the Southern Baptist Convention to the head of Catholic charities to rabbis and lay leaders.



Before we get started, on behalf of CNN and the candidates, I'd like to thank the people behind tonight's event, Faith in Public Life, the ONE Campaign, Oxfam America, and, of course, our hosts, Messiah College.



And I'd like now to introduce my co-host. Please welcome Jon Meacham. He is the editor of Newsweek and one of America's best-known writers of religion and matters of faith.



Welcome, Jon.



MEACHAM: Thank you.



BROWN: Tonight, we're going to spend about half of our time with Senator Clinton, about half of our time with Senator Obama. The order tonight was decided by coin toss. Senator Clinton won and has elected to go first. Questions will come from Jon and me and from some of the faith leaders assembled here in our audience, so let's get started.



Without further ado, please welcome the senator from New York, Hillary Clinton.



BROWN: Nice to see you. Welcome.



(APPLAUSE)



CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you very much.



BROWN: Senator Clinton, welcome to you.



CLINTON: Thank you.



BROWN: Jon has got the first question.



CLINTON: Great. Well, it's wonderful to be here. I want to thank Messiah College for hosting this. Very good of you to do this.



(APPLAUSE)



MEACHAM: Senator, we'll start with the news. You have been extremely critical of Senator Obama's recent comments in San Francisco in which he argued that some hard-pressed Americans have -- economically hard-pressed Americans have, and I quote, ""gotten bitter and cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or antitrade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.""



Senator, you have written of how faith sustained you in bitter times. Many of us have been sustained by our faith in bitter times. What exactly is wrong with what Senator Obama had to say?



CLINTON: Well, I'm going to let Senator Obama speak for himself. But from my perspective, the characterization of people in a way that really seemed to be elitist and out of touch is something that we have to overcome.



You know, the Democratic Party, to be very blunt about it, has been viewed as a party that didn't understand and respect the values and the way of life of so many of our fellow Americans.



And I think it's important that we make clear that we believe people are people of faith because it is part of their whole being; it is what gives them meaning in life, through good times and bad times. It is there as a spur, an anchor, to center one in the storms, but also to guide one forward in the day-to-day living that is part of everyone's journey.



And, you know, when we think about the legitimate concerns that people have about trade or immigration, those are problems to be solved. And that's what I think we should be focused on.



But I am very confident that, as we move forward tonight and beyond, people will get a chance to get to know each of us a little better, and that's really what I want to talk about. I will leave it to Senator Obama to speak for himself; he does an excellent job of that.



And I will speak for myself on what my faith journey is and what, you know, leads me to this chair here tonight.



BROWN: But, Senator, you've been out there on the stump attacking him pretty aggressively over this. And his response has been -- and he said it pretty bluntly tonight -- shame on you. You know that he is a man of faith. This is what he's saying. And to suggest that he is demeaning religion is you playing politics. CLINTON: Well, he will have to speak for himself and provide his own explanation. But I do think it raises a lot of concerns and we've seen that exhibited in the last several days by people here in Pennsylvania, in Indiana where I was yesterday, and elsewhere, because it did seem so much in-line with what often we are charged with.



Someone goes to a closed-door fund-raiser in San Francisco and makes comments that do seem elitist, out of touch and, frankly, patronizing. That has nothing to do with him being a good man or a man of faith.



We had two very good men and men of faith run for president in 2000 and 2004. But large segments of the electorate concluded that they did not really understand or relate to or frankly respect their ways of life.



And I think that is an issue for voters, as I've heard today from people I visited in Scranton and elsewhere. So this is a legitimate political issue. And there are some issues that are not. But this one is.



And I do believe that Senator Obama will have a chance to explain himself tonight. And I'm sure he will take that opportunity.



BROWN: Let's talk about your faith. And we warned people the questions tonight would be pretty personal. So I want to ask you. You said in an interview last year that you believe in the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. And you have actually felt the presence of the Holy Spirit on many occasions.



Share some of those occasions with us.



CLINTON: You know, I have, ever since I've been a little girl, felt the presence of God in my life. And it has been a gift of grace that has, for me, been incredibly sustaining. But, really, ever since I was a child, I have felt the enveloping support and love of God and I have had the experiences on many, many occasions where I felt like the holy spirit was there with me as I made a journey.



It didn't have to be a hard time. You know, it could be taking a walk in the woods. It could be watching a sunset.



You know, I am someone who has talked a lot about my life. You know more about my life than you know about nearly anybody else's, about 60 books worth...



(LAUGHTER)



CLINTON: ... some of which are, you know, frankly, a little bit off-base. But I don't think that I could have made my life's journey without being anchored in God's grace and without having that, you know, sense of forgiveness and unconditional love. And I am not going to point to one or another matter. I mean, some of my struggles and challenges have been extremely public. And I have talked about how I have been both guided and supported through those, trying to find my own way through, because, for me, my faith has given me the confidence to make decisions that were right for me, whether anybody else agreed with me or not.



And it is just such a part of who I am and what I have lived through for so many years that trying to pull out and say, oh, I remember, I was sitting right there when I felt, you know, God's love embrace me, would be, I think, trivializing what has been an extraordinary sense of support and possibility that I have had with me my entire life.



MEACHAM: Senator, you -- right after New Hampshire, you and I had a conversation a couple of days after that in which you described your moment in the setting where you said that you worked very hard and it was seen as a turning point by many people. You described that as a moment of grace.



CLINTON: Yes.



MEACHAM: So that is a specific in...



CLINTON: Right, right. Well, you know, Jon, it is -- it is perhaps a reluctance on my part that is rooted in my personal reserve, rooted in the way I was raised, that I worry and I -- you know, I understand you want to ask a lot of personal questions, and I appreciate that.



But I also worry, as I suggested to you in that same interview, that you have to walk the walk of faith. And talking about it is important because it's important to share that experience. But I also believe that, you know, faith is just -- it's grace. It's love. It's mystery. It's provocation.



It is everything that makes life and its purpose meaningful as a human being.



CLINTON: And those moments of grace are ones that I cherish and, you know, in asked a specific question about how I felt when I shared my belief that politics is not a game, it is not a who's up, who's down.



I mean, it is a serious search and we are so fortunate because we have taken the gifts that God gave us and we have created this democracy where we choose our leaders and we have to be more mindful of how important and serious a business this is.



And, therefore, when I say politics is not a game, it is really coming from deep within me because I know that we have the opportunity to really give other people a chance to live up to their own God-given potential. And that, to me, is the kind of grace note that makes politics worthwhile. Because, believe me, there's a lot about it that is not particularly welcoming or easy.



But every day as I travel around the country, I meet people whose faith just knocks me over. I mean, I was with a woman in Philadelphia Friday morning whose son was murdered on the streets in Philadelphia, whose grandson was murdered. And she and I just sat together and she told me about how strong her faith is and how it has sustained her and how she believes, you know, God is with her and she doesn't understand why this happened to her son and her grandson.



But every day she's grateful, and she is determined to be the person that she believes God meant her to be. And so when I sit there and I listen to that woman tell me about how it felt and how today she is still, you know, getting up every morning, has a smile on her face, looking to go to her daycare business and take care of all of these children who have been entrusted to her, that's a moment of grace.



But it's not about me. I mean, not every moment of grace is about you. More often it is about the interaction and the relationship. You know, grace is that relationship with God. But it's also the relationships with our fellow human beings in which we know grace is present. And so I just feel very fortunate that, you know, I have been able to experience that and I wish it for everyone.



BROWN: Let's bring a question in from one of the religious leaders joining us tonight. Dr. Joel Hunter, who is senior pastor of the 12,000-member Northland Church in Longwood, Florida. Dr. Hunter?



CLINTON: How are you, Dr. Hunter? Good to see you.



PASTOR JOEL HUNTER, NORTHLAND CHURCH: I'm fine, Senator. Good to see you. Senator, many of the issues we're going to be talking about tonight, Darfur, AIDS, abortion, torture, could present you with choices that will have life and death consequences for countless people around the world. What are the first principles you fall back on to make such decisions? Are there certain activities or references or people with whom you consult in order to do what is morally right?



CLINTON: You know, Dr. Hunter, I think this is one of the challenges that face any of us who are in public life where literally you do have the authority to make these decisions that could very well be life and death decisions and they are daunting and I do not pretend to know how I will deal with every single one of them.



But I do have a sense of the process by which I will try to approach them. And it really is rooted in, you know, my prayer, my contemplation, my study. I think you have to immerse yourself in advice, information, criticism from others. I don't pretend to even believe that I know the answers to a lot of these questions. I don't.



But I do believe that you have to be willing to expose yourself to many different points of view and then you have to make that decision. I think that for a lot of us, decisions are ones that you don't just make and put on a shelf. To be fair to be constantly struggling and challenging yourself, you have to keep opening up that decision and asking.



CLINTON: And very often, as you know, some decisions look like they're 100-to-nothing until you actually examine them. And some decisions truly are right down the middle, and you're not sure which side of the line you will decide upon.



You mentioned some of the very difficult decisions that we are going to face, and there are countless more. How do we get out of Iraq the right way? Everyone knows there is no easy, comfortable decision.



I believe we've got to begin taking our troops out of Iraq based on my analysis of what I think is the best path forward for us and for the Iraqis. But I am deeply aware that there will be predictable and unpredictable consequences. And part of making a decision is having to live with the consequences.



And I have been very fortunate in my life to have people whom I feel very comfortable talking to openly, with total frankness, seeking their guidance. They don't all agree with me; they don't all share my view, when I start the conversation, perhaps.



But I don't think you can surround yourself only with people with whom you think you will agree. And, for me, being amongst people who challenge me, who make me uncomfortable, to be very blunt, is an important part of my decisionmaking process.



I want to push back; I want to argue; I want to raise other hypotheticals and throw them back to see what the outcome is.



But at the end of the day, since we are running to be the president of the United States, you have to be comfortable making a decision, because you cannot say, ""Well, let's put it on the back burner and then get back to it some time when it's clearer,"" for many of these decisions. And then you have to live with the consequences.



But I hope I will never, ever find myself being defensive or abrupt and dismissive of people who disagree with me. I regret that that often happens in politics, and maybe it's because oftentimes the decisionmaking process is so exhausting.



You know, if you're a person of faith, after you've prayed, if you're a person willing to subject yourself to criticism, after you've done it, you're just so relieved to make the decision you don't want to revisit it. But I don't think that a president can afford to do that.



MEACHAM: Senator, do you believe personally that life begins at conception?



CLINTON: I believe that the potential for life begins at conception. I am a Methodist, as you know. My church has struggled with this issue. In fact, you can look at the Methodist Book of Discipline and see the contradiction and the challenge of trying to sort that very profound question out.



But for me, it is also not only about a potential life; it is about the other lives involved. And, therefore, I have concluded, after great, you know, concern and searching my own mind and heart over many years, that our task should be in this pluralistic, diverse life of ours in this nation that individuals must be entrusted to make this profound decision, because the alternative would be such an intrusion of government authority that it would be very difficult to sustain in our kind of open society.



And as some of you've heard me discuss before, I think abortion should remain legal, but it needs to be safe and rare.



And I have spent many years now, as a private citizen, as first lady, and now as senator, trying to make it rare, trying to create the conditions where women had other choices.



I have supported adoption, foster care. I helped to create the campaign against teenage pregnancy, which fulfilled our original goal 10 years ago of reducing teenage pregnancies by about a third.



And I think we have to do even more.



CLINTON: And I am committed to doing that. And I guess I would just add from my own personal experience, I have been in countries that have taken very different views about this profoundly challenging question.



Some of you know, I went to China in 1995 and spoke out against the Chinese government's one child policy, which led to forced abortions and forced sterilization because I believed that we needed to bear witness against what was an intrusive, abusive, dehumanizing effort to dictate how women and men would proceed with respect to the children they wished to have.



And then shortly after that, I was in Romania and there I met women who had been subjected to the Communist regime of the 1970s and '80s where they were essentially forced to bear as many children as possible for the good of the state. And where abortion was criminalized and women were literally forced to have physical exams and followed by the secret police and so many children were abandoned and left to the orphanages that, unfortunately, led to an AIDS epidemic.



So, you know, when I think about this issue, I think about the whole range of concerns and challenges associated with it and I will continue to do what I can to reduce the number and to improve and increase the care for women and particularly the adoption system and the other opportunities that women would have to make different choices.



BROWN: Senator, I want to go to the other end of the spectrum and the end of life and ask you, do you believe it is compassionate, that it is appropriate to let someone who is really suffering choose to end their life?



CLINTON: Again, this is one of those incredibly challenging issues. You know, the Terry Schiavo case in Florida posed that for many people. And it was one of those decisions to go back to Dr. Hunter's point, where there were people of good faith and people of strong feelings on both sides about what should happen to that woman's life.



And I don't know that any of us is in a position to make that choice for families or for individuals, but I don't want us also to condone government action that would legitimize or encourage end of life decisions. Somehow there has to be a framework for us to determine how can people who are either able to make these decisions on their own do so? Or if they are not, how best do we create a decision process for their families to try to decide?



And now we are being faced with a lot of these difficult decisions because of what the world we live in today with modern technology and so much else. And we're going to have to come to grips with them one way or another.



BROWN: We've got to take a quick break, a commercial break. We'll be back. Much more with Senator Clinton, right after this.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



BROWN: Welcome back to ""The Compassion Forum"", everyone. We're here with Senator Hillary Clinton.



And, Senator, there are a lot of Americans who are uncomfortable with the conversation that we're having here tonight. That they believe religion already has way too much influence in political life and public life. How do you reassure them?



CLINTON: Well, I understand that concern because part of our obligation as leaders in America is to make sure that any conversation about religion is inclusive and respectful. And that has not always happened, as we know. And it is so personal. The spiritual journey that each of us takes or doesn't take.



And I think it's important that we recognize that for good cause, I mean, we have been such a vibrant nation when it comes to religious experience in large measure because we've always protected ourselves against, you know, religion going too far, being too intrusive. So it is a balance. And we want religion to be in the public square. If you are a person of faith, you have a right and even an obligation to speak from that wellspring of your faith. But to do so in a respectful and inclusive way.



So I understand why some people, even religious people, even people of faith might say, why are you having this forum? And why are you exploring these issues from two people who are vying to be president of the United States?



And I think that's a fair question to ask. I am here because I think it's also fair for us to have this conversation. But I'm very conscious of how thoughtful we must proceed.



BROWN: Another question from the audience. Rabbi Steve Gutow, who is director of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs is with us.



Rabbi?



RABBI STEVE GUTOW, JEWISH COUNCIL FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS: Senator Clinton?



CLINTON: Yes, Rabbi.



GUTOW: Back to China. China has continued to persecute and subject to oppression, the people of Tibet. It continues to be the largest supplier of weapons to Sudan and the largest purchaser of its oil. Let's just say China is not doing all it can to stop the genocide in Darfur. You have said that America needs to return to being a moral voice of the world.



Is our participation in the Beijing Olympics harmful to that moral voice?



CLINTON: Well, Rabbi, I appreciate your asking this question because I think it's a question of both political and moral significance. And that's why last week I called on our president to decide he would not attend the opening ceremonies of the Olympics because that is a public and very obvious ratification of our government's approval of the Beijing government's actions.



CLINTON: Unless the Chinese began to take very visible steps to begin to end the suppression of the Tibetans and undermining their culture and religious beliefs, and if we could get more cooperation out of the Chinese government with respect to Sudan.



And, of course, I would welcome even more action on behalf of human rights. But the challenge is, how do we try to influence the Chinese government? And I believe we have missed many opportunities during the Bush administration to do so.



In fact, I think it's fair to say our policy toward China is incoherent and that has not been in the best interest of our values or our strategic interest. So I would urge the president at least to consider and, therefore, publicly say that he will not be attending the opening ceremonies.



And let's see whether the Chinese government begins to respond because that for them would be a great loss of face and perhaps we would get more cooperation. We would get the process going that the Dalai Lama has asked for over many years.



There could be a lot of ways that the Chinese government demonstrated it heard our concerns.



BROWN: A question from Reverend William Shaw. He is the president of the National Baptist Convention.



Reverend Shaw?



CLINTON: He is. Hello, Reverend Shaw. Good to see you again.



REV. WILLIAM J. SHAW, NATIONAL BAPTIST CONVENTION: Senator. Current U.S. policies toward developing countries -- trade policies, make it sometimes extremely difficult for poor people to access inexpensive, generic drugs for the treatment of AIDS and other sicknesses.



How would you shape the policies of your administration to ensure that the poor would have access to and could secure the drugs that they need to improve the quality of their lives, of their families and even the future of their country?



CLINTON: Well, Reverend Shaw, I agree with your description of this problem, and I believe that our government must do so much more to get generic drugs and low-cost drugs to people suffering.



Not only from HIV/AIDS, but the range of diseases that affect disproportionately the poor. It's one of the reasons why I voted against the free trade agreement with Central America, because there was a provision that would give even more power to our pharmaceutical companies to prevent exactly doing what you are discussing.



I have been an outspoken advocate in urging that both our great pharmaceutical companies -- which do a lot of good. Because, after all, they invent the compounds and put them together that the generics then are able to copy.



But we need to do much more to get our pharmaceutical companies to work with us to get the drug costs down and to open the pathway for generic drugs. And that's going to take presidential leadership.



I commend President Bush for his PEPFAR initiative. It was a very bold and important commitment, but it didn't go far enough in opening up the door to generics and getting the costs down.



And as president, I will do that.



MEACHAM: Senator, we've heard about HIV/AIDS. Many people here are concerned about Darfur and a number of other humanitarian issues. Why do you think it is that a loving God allows innocent people to suffer?



CLINTON: Well...



(LAUGHTER)



MEACHAM: And we just have 30 seconds.



CLINTON: Yes. You know, that is the subject of generations of commentary and debate. And I don't know. I can't wait to ask him. Because I have...



(LAUGHTER)



CLINTON: I have just pondered it endless endlessly.



(APPLAUSE)



CLINTON: But I do want to just add that what that means to me is that in the face of suffering, there is no doubt in my mind that God calls us to respond. You know, that's part of what we are expected to do.



For whatever reason it exists, it's very existence is a call to action. Certainly in, you know, our...



(APPLAUSE)



CLINTON: You know, in my Judeo-Christian faith tradition, in both the Old and the New Testament, the incredible demands that God places on us and that the prophets ask of us, and that Christ called us to respond to on behalf of the poor are unavoidable.



CLINTON: And it's always been curious to me how our debate about religion in America too often misses that. You know, his holiness, the pope, is going to be coming to America next week, and he's been a strong voice on behalf of what we must do to deal with poverty, and deal with injustice, and deal with what is truly our obligations toward those who are the least among us.



So maybe, you know, the lord is just waiting for us to respond to his call, because this despair, this impoverishment of body and soul is what we are expected to be spending our time responding to, and so few of us do.



Even those who are doing wonderful work with organizations represented in this audience, we are just not doing enough. And it's a personal call; it's a family community, religious call; and it's a governmental call. And we've got to do more to respond to that call.



(APPLAUSE)



BROWN: Quickly, just you brought up the Bible. We were talking theology. Do you have a favorite Bible story?



CLINTON: Oh, I have so many of them. You know, I was fortunate as a child growing up to be read Bible stories, to go to Sunday school, to go to Bible school. And Bill and I read, you know, Bible stories to Chelsea.



And, you know, I have talked about Bible stories and parables a lot in my life with friends. And, you know, it depends upon what's going on in my life at the time.



But clearly, for me, the recent Purim holiday for Jews raised the question of Esther. And I have been -- ever since I was a little girl -- a great admirer of Esther. And I used to ask that that be read to me over and over again, because there weren't too many models of women who had the opportunity to make a decision, to take a chance, a risk that, you know, was very courageous.



And so that's the one that's most recently on my mind, because I have some rabbi friends who send me readings that go with the scripture of the week. And certainly, Esther is someone who I wish I knew even more about than what we know from the Bible.



BROWN: A question from Eboo Patel, who is a Muslim, is the founder and executive director of the Interfaith Youth Core.



Welcome.



CLINTON: Hello.



QUESTION: As-Salamu Alaykum, Senator Clinton.



CLINTON: Thank you.



QUESTION: My name is Eboo Patel. I'm an American Muslim, and I lead an organization called the Interfaith Youth Core. And it's my privilege to watch a range of faith communities come together around the common value of compassion.



Americans of all faiths and no faith at all genuinely believe in compassion and want to apply that in addressing global poverty and climate change. Can we do that without changing our standard of living?



CLINTON: Well, I believe there is so much we can do that we're not doing that would not change our standard of living as an imposition from the outside, but which would inspire us to take action that would impact how we live.



And I don't think we would notice it demonstrably undermining our standard of living, but it would give us the opportunity to set an example and to be a model.



When I think about the simple steps any one of us can take -- you know, turning off lights when one leaves a room, unplugging appliances, changing to compact florescent bulbs -- you know, my husband and I have done that -- I don't think it's impacted our standard of living, but we feel like we're making a small contribution to limiting the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, you know, being more mindful of our purchases.



I hope that, as president, I can model that and lead that effort so that people don't feel so threatened by the changes we're talking about when it comes to dealing with global warming.



In preparation for the pope's visit, I was reading that the Vatican is the first carbon-neutral state in the world now. Well, that shows leadership. And I don't think it has impacted the work or the living. You know, Ambassador Flynn, who was our ambassador to the Vatican, might know. But it was a great statement.



And we can do more.



CLINTON: And I think that, with leadership, people will find ways to take those first steps. And then we can take even more.



Now there's so much that I have to do as president with the cap in trade system, with moving away from our dependence on foreign oil, but I'm going to look for ways that will cushion the costs on middle class and working and poor people. Because I don't believe that they should have to bear more than what they are bearing right now as we make this transition. And I believe we can accomplish that.



BROWN: Let's go to Lisa Sharon Harper. She is the executive director of New York Faith and Justice. Welcome to you.



LISA SHARON HARPER, N.Y. FAITH AND JUSTICE: Thank you. Senator Clinton, underdeveloped nations and regions that lack widespread access to education and basic resources like water, and they tend to be some of the most unstable and dangerous regions of the world. Places like Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan. Our national security is at stake, but our military is stretched. As president, would you consider committing U.S. troops to a purely humanitarian mission under the leadership of a foreign flag?



CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying, No. 1, I believe strongly that we have to get back to leading on issues like health care and education and women's rights around the world. I have introduced legislation called The Education for All Act. And it's bipartisan. I introduced it first in '04 and then we reintroduced it on a bipartisan basis in '07.



And the work that I would want to do to have the United States lead the world in putting the 77 million kids who aren't in school into school, having us lead when it comes to health care, particularly in malaria, T.B., HIV/AIDS, but also women's health which has been woefully neglected.



I believe we should demonstrate our commitment to people who are poor, disenfranchised, disempowered before we talk about putting troops anywhere. The United States has to be seen again as a peacekeeper, and we have lost that standing in these last seven years.



Therefore, I want us to have a partnership, government to government, government with the private sector, government with our NGOS and our faith community to show the best of what America has to offer. You know, I really appreciated President Bush after the tsunami struck, asking his father and my husband to represent the United States and our concern for the people who have been devastated.



And, yes, the military was there delivering supplies. That sent a loud message and it was resonating throughout South Asia -- in Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world. America's favorability rose dramatically because we were seen as caring and compassionate toward those with whom we had very little contact or, in fact, some, you know, level of distrust previously.



So I think we have to concentrate first and foremost on restoring our moral authority in the world and our standing in the world. And there are lots of ways that the United State"	0
227	"Hillary Clinton's advantage over Donald Trump has narrowed to just three points Ã¢ÂÂ resulting in a dead-heat general-election contest with more than five months to go until November, according to a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.

Clinton, who remains a heavy favorite to win the Democrat nomination, leads the presumptive GOP nominee 46 percent to 43 percent among registered voters, a difference that is within the pollÃ¢ÂÂs margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points. In April, Clinton held an 11-point advantage over Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent, and had led him consistently by double digits since December.

In a more hypothetical matchup, Democrat Bernie Sanders leads Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent.

Looking inside the numbers of her race against Trump, Clinton holds the edge among African Americans (88 percent to 9 percent), Latinos (68 percent to 20 percent), women (51 percent to 38 percent) and those ages 18 to 34 (55 percent to 32 percent).

Trump, meanwhile, is ahead among whites (52 percent to 36 percent), seniors (52 percent to 41 percent), men (49 percent to 40 percent) and independents (42 percent to 37 percent).

The NBC/WSJ poll Ã¢ÂÂ conducted May 15-19 Ã¢ÂÂ comes after Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, but also as the ongoing Clinton-vs.-Sanders Democratic race has become more contentious in recent days.

Republicans are now supporting Trump over Clinton by an 86 percent-to-6 percent margin, which is up from 72 percent to 13 percent a month ago, suggesting that GOP voters are consolidating around their presumptive nominee.

Complete Coverage: Decision 2016

While Democrats are backing Clinton by an 83 percent-to-9 percent clip, just 66 percent of Democratic primary voters preferring Sanders support Clinton in a matchup against Trump (compared with 88 percent of Clinton primary voters who favor Sanders in a hypothetical general-election contest). Those numbers underscore ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs challenge in winning over Sanders voters once the Democratic primary contest concludes.

Mr. and Mrs. Unpopular

Trump and Clinton are currently the two most unpopular likely presidential nominees in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll.

Thirty four percent of registered voters have a positive opinion of Clinton, versus 54 percent who have a negative opinion (-20) Ã¢ÂÂ a slight uptick from her minus-24 score last month.

Trump's rating is even worse than ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs: Twenty nine percent have a positive opinion of him, while 58 percent have a negative opinion (-29) Ã¢ÂÂ an improvement from his minus-41 score in April.

Ã¢ÂÂThis has never been matched, or even close to being matched,Ã¢ÂÂ Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff, says of these negative ratings for Trump and Clinton.

By contrast, Sanders is in positive territory. Forty-three percent have a positive view of the Vermont senator, versus 36 percent who have a negative view (+7). One difference Clinton and Sanders: ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs rating among Democratic voters supporting Sanders is 38 percent positive, 41 percent negative (-3); SandersÃ¢ÂÂ rating among Clinton supporters is 54 percent positive, 23 percent negative (+31).

President ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs overall score in the current NBC/WSJ poll is at 49 percent positive, 41 percent negative (+8).

Forty Seven Percent Would Consider a Third-Party Candidate

Asked if they would consider a third-party candidate if Clinton and Trump were the major party nominees, 47 percent of registered voters say yes -- a higher percentage than those who said yes on a similar question in 2008 and 2012.

Fifty percent of voters say they would not consider a third-party candidate.

The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted May 15-19 of 1,000 registered voters, including 450 cell phone-only respondents and another 46 reached on a cell but who also have a landline. The overall margin of error is plus-minus 3.1 percentage points."	0

229	"It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.

2017 was a year which saw the truth Ã¢ÂÂ objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine Ã¢ÂÂalternative factsÃ¢ÂÂ into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. Ã¢ÂÂThe enemy of the people,Ã¢ÂÂ was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.

Mr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase Ã¢ÂÂenemy of the people,Ã¢ÂÂ that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of Ã¢ÂÂannihilating such individualsÃ¢ÂÂ who disagreed with the supreme leader.

This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward Ã¢ÂÂ despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despotÃ¢ÂÂs enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt suit him Ã¢ÂÂfake news,Ã¢ÂÂ it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.

I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of Ã¢ÂÂfake newsÃ¢ÂÂ are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.

According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on Ã¢ÂÂfalse newsÃ¢ÂÂ charges.

Mr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful Ã¢ÂÂ in fact, we question the powerful most ardently Ã¢ÂÂ to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.

No politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.

Of course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians donÃ¢ÂÂt.

No longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism Ã¢ÂÂ who must constantly deflect and distort and distract Ã¢ÂÂ who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.

Now, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the Ã¢ÂÂmost corrupt and dishonestÃ¢ÂÂ media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.

And so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.

Together, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction.

It is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial Ã¢ÂÂ such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last yearÃ¢ÂÂs inaugural.

But many untruths are not at all trivial Ã¢ÂÂ such as the seminal untruth of the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate Ã¢ÂÂ to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all Ã¢ÂÂ the supposed Ã¢ÂÂhoaxÃ¢ÂÂ at the heart of special counsel Robert MuellerÃ¢ÂÂs Russia investigation.

To be very clear, to call the Russia matter a Ã¢ÂÂhoaxÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ as the president has many times Ã¢ÂÂ is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security. It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads.

Ignoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth Ã¢ÂÂ so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country.

Mr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated.

Mr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports.

But a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story:

Ã¢ÂÂIn FebruaryÃ¢ÂÂ¦Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, Ã¢ÂÂYou can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.Ã¢ÂÂ

In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being Ã¢ÂÂdemonizedÃ¢ÂÂ by Ã¢ÂÂfake news.Ã¢ÂÂ Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote Ã¢ÂÂlaughing by his sideÃ¢ÂÂ Duterte called reporters Ã¢ÂÂspies.Ã¢ÂÂ

In July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had Ã¢ÂÂspread lots of false versions, lots of liesÃ¢ÂÂ about his country, adding, Ã¢ÂÂThis is what we call Ã¢ÂÂfake newsÃ¢ÂÂ today, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it?Ã¢ÂÂ

There are more:

Ã¢ÂÂA state official in Myanmar recently said, Ã¢ÂÂThere is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,Ã¢ÂÂ referring to the persecuted ethnic group.

Leaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised Ã¢ÂÂfake newsÃ¢ÂÂ legislation in the new year.Ã¢ÂÂ

And on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.

We are not in a Ã¢ÂÂfake newsÃ¢ÂÂ era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere.

In our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster. As George Orwell warned, Ã¢ÂÂThe further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.Ã¢ÂÂ

Any of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the pressÃ¢ÂÂs obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the peopleÃ¢ÂÂs right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it.

What is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question:

Ã¢ÂÂWe are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world -- made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions.

We are a mature democracy Ã¢ÂÂ it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring Ã¢ÂÂ or worse, endorsing -- these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.

I sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: Ã¢ÂÂWhat is truth?Ã¢ÂÂ His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled Ã¢ÂÂOh Say, What is Truth.Ã¢ÂÂ It ends as follows:

Ã¢ÂÂThen say, what is truth? Ã¢ÂÂTis the last and the first,

For the limits of time it steps oÃ¢ÂÂer.

Tho the heavens depart and the earthÃ¢ÂÂs fountains burst.

Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,

EternalÃ¢ÂÂ¦ unchangedÃ¢ÂÂ¦ evermore.Ã¢ÂÂ

Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Waukegan, IL | The capture of a huge 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of missing people in the area in the last decade, has confirmed the U.S. Coast Guard this morning.

Canadian tourist, John OÃ¢ÂÂKeef and his friend from Chicago, Allan Brooks captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake.

Ã¢ÂÂWe reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before my friend Allan finally shot it with a rifle and wounded it to the headÃ¢ÂÂ explains OÃ¢ÂÂKeef.

Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂd heard of the Lake Michigan monster, but never did I expect to catch it myself,Ã¢ÂÂ claims the 63-year-old Canadian tourist.

The great white shark estimated at more than 1.2 tons is the biggest fish ever caught in the region, believe experts.

Professor of biology at the University of Illinois, Allan Jameson said: Ã¢ÂÂThis is not common to find such a beast so far inland. Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.Ã¢ÂÂ he admits, visibly puzzled. Ã¢ÂÂIt is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,Ã¢ÂÂ he told reporters.

According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.

U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the regionÃ¢ÂÂs waters Ã¢ÂÂis highly unlikelyÃ¢ÂÂ as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.

In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930."	1

SENATORS say they fear the N.R.A. and the gun lobby. But I think that fear must be nothing compared to the fear the first graders in Sandy Hook Elementary School felt as their lives ended in a hail of bullets. The fear that those children who survived the massacre must feel every time they remember their teachers stacking them into closets and bathrooms, whispering that they loved them, so that love would be the last thing the students heard if the gunman found them.

On Wednesday, a minority of senators gave into fear and blocked common-sense legislation that would have made it harder for criminals and people with dangerous mental illnesses to get hold of deadly firearms Ã¢ÂÂ a bill that could prevent future tragedies like those in Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., Blacksburg, Va., and too many communities to count.

Some of the senators who voted against the background-check amendments have met with grieving parents whose children were murdered at Sandy Hook, in Newtown. Some of the senators who voted no have also looked into my eyes as I talked about my experience being shot in the head at point-blank range in suburban Tucson two years ago, and expressed sympathy for the 18 other people shot besides me, 6 of whom died. These senators have heard from their constituents Ã¢ÂÂ who polls show overwhelmingly favored expanding background checks. And still these senators decided to do nothing. Shame on them.

I watch TV and read the papers like everyone else. We know what weÃ¢ÂÂre going to hear: vague platitudes like Ã¢ÂÂtough voteÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂcomplicated issue.Ã¢ÂÂ I was elected six times to represent southern Arizona, in the State Legislature and then in Congress. I know what a complicated issue is; I know what it feels like to take a tough vote. This was neither. These senators made their decision based on political fear and on cold calculations about the money of special interests like the National Rifle Association, which in the last election cycle spent around $25 million on contributions, lobbying and outside spending."	0

LESTER HOLT: Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I'm Lester Holt, anchor of ""NBC Nightly News."" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.

Advertisement

The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.

The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.

The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.

Advertisement

I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: How are you, Donald?

(APPLAUSE)

HOLT: Good luck to you.

(APPLAUSE)

Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.

Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin.

Advertisement

We're calling this opening segment ""Achieving Prosperity."" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.

Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?

CLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.

The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.

Advertisement

I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.

CLINTON: I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.

And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.

Advertisement

How are we going to do it? We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.

Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you. We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.

HOLT: Secretary Clinton, thank you.

Mr. Trump, the same question to you. It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.

TRUMP: Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.

Advertisement

So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.

So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.

But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.

Advertisement

TRUMP: We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.

Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.

HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?

CLINTON: Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.

We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.

Advertisement

I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.

We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.

I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.

I don't buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.

And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.

HOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?

TRUMP: Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.

Our country's in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best, the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.

So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.

Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.

Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.

But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...

HOLT: Let me interrupt just a moment, but...

TRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester. HOLT: Back to the question, though. How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?

TRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.

And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.

And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that's a big, big factor.

HOLT: Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.

CLINTON: Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.

In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."" Well, it did collapse.

TRUMP: That's called business, by the way.

CLINTON: Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.

Now, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.

Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.

They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real.

TRUMP: I did not. I did not. I do not say that.

CLINTON: I think science is real.

TRUMP: I do not say that.

CLINTON: And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.

So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.

HOLT: Mr. Trump?

TRUMP: She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one.

Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.

The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.

So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.

And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.

And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.

CLINTON: Well, actually...

TRUMP: I will bring -- excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs.

CLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.

TRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.

CLINTON: And I have -- well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...

TRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA...

(CROSSTALK)

CLINTON: ... million new jobs, a balanced budget...

TRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.

CLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.

When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.

But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do. I'm going to have a special prosecutor. We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.

When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.

HOLT: Very quickly...

TRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...

CLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald...

TRUMP: You haven't done it. You haven't done it.

CLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state...

TRUMP: Excuse me.

CLINTON: And I have done a lot...

TRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.

CLINTON: Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion.

TRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.

And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.

CLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in...

TRUMP: You called it the gold standard.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.

CLINTON: No.

TRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.

CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...

TRUMP: Not.

CLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book...

TRUMP: So is it President Obama's fault?

CLINTON: ... before you even announced.

TRUMP: Is it President Obama's fault?

CLINTON: Look, there are differences...

TRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?

CLINTON: There are...

TRUMP: Because he's pushing it.

CLINTON: There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.

TRUMP: But you have no plan.

CLINTON: But in -- oh, but I do.

TRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan.

CLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about it. It's called ""Stronger Together."" You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...

TRUMP: That's about all you've...

(CROSSTALK)

HOLT: Folks, we're going to...

CLINTON: ... or at an airport near you.

HOLT: We're going to move to...

CLINTON: But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.

So we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.

TRUMP: You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.

And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.

When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.

I'm going to cut regulations. I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.

HOLT: Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment. We're going to talk taxes...

CLINTON: That can't -- that can't be left to stand.

HOLT: Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.

CLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...

TRUMP: Facts.

CLINTON: So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed...

TRUMP: And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.

CLINTON: ... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.

HOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment.

TRUMP: Well, could I just finish -- I think I...

(CROSSTALK)

HOLT: I'm going to give you a chance right here...

TRUMP: I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.

HOLT: ... with a new 15-minute segment...

TRUMP: She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.

HOLT: Mr. Trump, I'm going to...

TRUMP: And look at her website. You know what? It's no difference than this. She's telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.

HOLT: The next segment, we're continuing...

CLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.

HOLT: ... achieving prosperity...

TRUMP: No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.

CLINTON: No, we're not. No, we're not.

TRUMP: See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.

CLINTON: That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.

HOLT: OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.

Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I'd like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I'd like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.

TRUMP: Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their companies. They're going to do a tremendous job.

I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy. It's a great thing for the middle class. It's a great thing for companies to expand.

And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.

So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.

Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together. Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.

And here's the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it's double that. It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.

But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.

HOLT: All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.

CLINTON: I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.

TRUMP: Why not?

CLINTON: Why not? Yeah, why not?

(LAUGHTER)

You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...

TRUMP: There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.

HOLT: This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.

TRUMP: Yes.

CLINTON: Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals. I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas. I happen to support that.

TRUMP: Then you didn't read it.

CLINTON: I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You've proposed an approach that has a...

TRUMP: Who gave it that name? The first I've -- who gave it that name?

(CROSSTALK)

HOLT: Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.

CLINTON: ... $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing...

TRUMP: How much? How much for my family? CLINTON: ... it is...

TRUMP: Lester, how much?

CLINTON: ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.

And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.

CLINTON: I don't think top-down works in America. I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.

HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're...

TRUMP: Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.

Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: We're in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.

We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.

HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts. Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?

TRUMP: I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released. And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.

But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.

But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?

We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.

HOLT: The IRS says an audit...

TRUMP: Excuse me.

HOLT: ... of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...

TRUMP: Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year.

And in a way, I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I don't mind it. It's almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people don't.

I will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release.

(APPLAUSE)

I will release my tax returns. And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it."" I will tell you this. No --"	0
235	"During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has often criticized China, most often on economic grounds. But in the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 14, 2016, Trump also took a shot at China over foreign policy -- specifically for not doing enough to rein in its neighbor, North Korea.

Trump said, ""China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to, but they taunt us.""

With the secretive nation back in the news for its claimed (but unverified) hydrogen bomb test earlier this month, we wondered whether Trump was right that China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea.""

When we took a closer look at this question, we found that experts on the region offered a nuanced answer. China, they said, does have notable influence over North Korea because it provides or enables transit for much of North KoreaÃ¢ÂÂs supply of goods from the outside world. But that influence, they added, falls well short of ""total control.""

""China does not Ã¢ÂÂcontrolÃ¢ÂÂ North Korea in any real sense of the word, but it has influence over North Korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than Beijing is willing to acknowledge,"" said Evans J.R. Revere, a senior fellow at the Brookings InstitutionÃ¢ÂÂs Center for East Asia Policy Studies.

Robert Ross, a China expert at Boston College and Harvard University, compared the relationship between China and North Korea to that between a parent and a teenager.

""ItÃ¢ÂÂs similar to dealing with a rebellious adolescent,"" Ross said. ""Do the parents have total control? Perhaps Ã¢ÂÂ they provide food and shelter. But the cost to the parents of using such leverage can be prohibitive Ã¢ÂÂ driving a child out of the house and away from the family. China has much at stake in its strategic and economic relationship with North Korea. But is there total control? That is debatable.""

ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs leverage over North Korea

The strongest argument for China having significant control over North Korea stems from its role in trade, particularly food and fuel.

North Korea has a lengthy land border with China -- its longest with any neighbor -- and while North Korea also has seaports, the rest of the world can more easily monitor shipments into those ports, making it preferable from North KoreaÃ¢ÂÂs perspective to move goods over land. Research by Stephan Haggard of the University of California-San Diego and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that China may account for as much as 80 percent of North KoreaÃ¢ÂÂs trade, and a similar percentage of its investment flows.

""North Korea would face daunting economic problems if China were to fully exercise its leverage, for example by cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so,"" Haggard told PolitiFact.

Why Ã¢ÂÂtotal controlÃ¢ÂÂ is an exaggeration

Yet while ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs economic lifeline gives it leverage, that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean it can simply wave a wand and make things happen in Pyongyang -- something one might reasonably assume when hearing TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs quote. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)

For starters, China has worried -- with reason, experts say -- that pushing so hard that the current North Korean regime collapses would lead to a humanitarian disaster on its border.

""China is reluctant to exercise its leverage, fearing possible effects of an economic breakdown on its border and an outflow of refugees,"" Haggard said.

It also has become painfully obvious over the years that North Korea doesnÃ¢ÂÂt exactly listen to outsiders.

""Mr. Trump is correct that the Chinese have leverage, but it is leverage they would have to use with the North Korean regime resisting them with everything they had,"" said Joseph de Thomas, a professor of international affairs at Penn State University. ""This is hardly control.""

Not only has North Korea thumbed its nose at the United Nations and world powers, but its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. In fact, the countryÃ¢ÂÂs national ideology -- juche -- is undergirded by the concept of self-reliance.

""North Korea is a country that prides itself on answering to no one and following no one's lead,"" Revere said. ""This has been a consistent element of North Korean behavior for decades, and is of course the reason why the regime is such a danger for the United States, for South Korea, the East Asia region, and the international community at large.""

Indeed, despite North KoreaÃ¢ÂÂs heavy reliance on China for food, fuel and virtually all other goods, ""it is not clear that the leadership cares,"" said Ross of Boston College and Harvard. ""For decades the population has lived in extreme poverty, while the elite has fared very well.""

Meanwhile, North KoreaÃ¢ÂÂs development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from China -- which only further complicates ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs situation.

This was on display with the recent test of the purported hydrogen bomb.

""China publicly and privately exhorted North Korea not to test nukes and missiles over the past few months, to no avail,"" said Scott A. Snyder, director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""As a result, relations between China and North Korea are strained. Chinese President Xi has not met with North KoreaÃ¢ÂÂs Kim Jong-un, while meeting six times with the South Korean leader.""

That does not sound like a country in ""total control"" of another.

TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs claim ""suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of both China and North Korea, both today and over the decades,"" Revere said. ""It is virtually certain that the Chinese were given no advance warning of the test, and Chinese anger was quite evident in the public statements the government made after the test. In the view of virtually every North Korea and China expert I know, the nuclear test was a slap in China's face, in addition to being a major challenge and threat to the international community.""

Our ruling

Trump said China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea.""

He has a point that China holds significant leverage over North Korea if it wishes to exercise it, since China provides the vast majority of North KoreaÃ¢ÂÂs international trade, including food and fuel imports. But TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs assertion, even slightly hedged as it is, overlooks some significant limits to that leverage, notably the North Korean governmentÃ¢ÂÂs willingness to follow its own drummer even if that means its people suffer. The fact that North Korea recently conducted a nuclear test over the strenuous objections of China suggests that Beijing lacks anything approaching ""total control"" over North Korea.

The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False."	0
236	"The federal government grants some businesses the ability to pay reduced or no taxes because they are set up as a Ã¢ÂÂnon-profit.Ã¢ÂÂ The NFL is one of those businesses Ã¢ÂÂ or was, until Sunday evening when Donald Trump quietly signed an executive order removing the sports leagueÃ¢ÂÂs non-profit status.

The order notes the un-American attitude displayed by the players, who repeatedly kneel during the National Anthem, burn flags in their locker rooms, and disrespect our country in every way imaginable.

To date, little has been done to stop players from disrespecting our military, our flag, and all they stand for, so President Trump Ã¢ÂÂtemporarilyÃ¢ÂÂ revoked their 401(c)(3) status Ã¢ÂÂuntil it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.Ã¢ÂÂ

The NFL will be classified as a for-profit entity for tax purposes for the 2017 fiscal year, but the order allows the league to re-apply for tax-exempt status in January 2018 Ã¢ÂÂif all of the problems are solved.Ã¢ÂÂ

The White House spokeswoman told Breitbart News that the President hopes to see all the Ã¢ÂÂathletes protesting our police and our flag or otherwise using their positions to spread hateÃ¢ÂÂ fired and replaced with people who Ã¢ÂÂlove and respect America.Ã¢ÂÂ

Melissa Gay, 14, met her parents, Robert and Lynette, at the police station in Montville, N.J., at 2:30 A.M. yesterday and returned home to Ridgefield, Conn.

We haven't really talked to her yet,"" Mr. Gay said yesterday from the Pierre Hotel. ""We just gave her hugs and brought her home.""

239	"If youÃ¢ÂÂre not a lazy bum on welfare or an illegal here to steal food stamps and free medicine, President Trump has some good news for you. You, your wife and your children will all be receiving a stimulus bonus of $612 each to spend however you see fit inside the United States.

The program, called Ã¢ÂÂTax Relief For Deserving Americans,Ã¢ÂÂ will give nothing to those who choose not to work, people in prison or illegal aliens. People on welfare in good standing with work programs or job training will receive an extra $25 in bonus food stamps instead. The White House Communication and Propaganda Office released a statement about the program and how it will impact the economy:

While deciding how to distract the American people from the nonsense being Ã¢ÂÂreportedÃ¢ÂÂ by the fake news media about world events and interior politics, President Trump was reminded of hoiw much everyone enjoyed the money George W Bush handed out from the surplus left over from the Clinton administration. Mr. trump has decided people would rather focus ion spending some money than the nonsense on the Ã¢ÂÂnews,Ã¢ÂÂ and has therefore authorized the release of $612 each for every legal American from a working family.

Democrats are already crying because the people who will receive their chunk of the $153 billion program donÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily need the money that could be spent buying them votes from deadbeats who like free stuff. They also donÃ¢ÂÂt understand how the program will be paid for. Trump had a simple answer:

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not that much money in the grand scheme. WeÃ¢ÂÂll make Mexico pay for it with a new tax or maybe weÃ¢ÂÂll add a few bucks tariff to every case of Canadian Whiskey. Maybe the Chinese can help out. ItÃ¢ÂÂs be taxable income, so 28 percent of it will come back anyway. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not that big a deal. IÃ¢ÂÂve built things, great things, huge things worth far more.Ã¢ÂÂ

One thing is for sure. You can forget about all the stupidity the liberals are trying to sell you about lies and Russians and North Korea and all the rest of the humdrum day to day you shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt concern yourself with anyway. What a waste of time. Grab some cash and have some fun on your leader, Donald Trump!

Checks will start arriving in the mail Friday.

Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs emails and RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs involvement in the Trump campaign, has said heÃ¢ÂÂs willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert MuellerÃ¢ÂÂs investigation.

Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBIÃ¢ÂÂs conduct during the 2016 election. StrzokÃ¢ÂÂs lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok Ã¢ÂÂintends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.Ã¢ÂÂ

The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, Ã¢ÂÂNo. No he wonÃ¢ÂÂt. WeÃ¢ÂÂll stop it.Ã¢ÂÂ The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with Ã¢ÂÂspecific investigative decisions,Ã¢ÂÂ but said that comment and others Ã¢ÂÂimplies a willingness to take official action.Ã¢ÂÂ

Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that thereÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂno questionÃ¢ÂÂ that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that Ã¢ÂÂI think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.

Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent Ã¢ÂÂintends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that thatÃ¢ÂÂs a topic, and his own integrity.Ã¢ÂÂ

Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector generalÃ¢ÂÂs findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs allies from calling for MuellerÃ¢ÂÂs immediate suspension.

Why was the FBIÃ¢ÂÂs sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that Ã¢ÂÂweÃ¢ÂÂll stopÃ¢ÂÂ Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018

Ã¢ÂÂThe highest level of bias IÃ¢ÂÂve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.Ã¢ÂÂ Trey Gowdy on the FBIÃ¢ÂÂs own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it? Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018

Strzok still works for the FBI, but itÃ¢ÂÂs unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action."	1

Wayne, Michigan

4:22 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, everybody! (Applause.) Give Mia a big round of applause for that outstanding introduction. (Applause.) Well, hello, Michigan! (Applause.) Happy New Year to everybody.

AUDIENCE: Happy New Year!

AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you!

THE PRESIDENT: I -- what was that? I love you back. (Laughter.)

I want to thank all the outstanding leaders that weÃ¢ÂÂve got here today. I want to introduce some of them. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got Secretary of Labor Tom Perez here. (Applause.) WeÃ¢ÂÂve got Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan here. (Applause.) Senator Gary Peters is in the house. (Applause.) Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here. (Applause.) Your outstanding CEO, Mark Fields, is here. (Applause.)

Now, I have to say I love the Secret Service, I love the Beasts that they put me in and -- thatÃ¢ÂÂs what we call the cars I drive in, Ã¢ÂÂthe Beasts.Ã¢ÂÂ So I like my ride these days. And it was made in Michigan, too. (Applause.) But I just had a chance to look at these new Mustangs, and IÃ¢ÂÂve got to say that the Mustangs have a little more style, a little more flavor. (Laughter and applause.)

Bill Ford is in the house. (Applause.) Surprisingly enough, we talked a little bit about Sunday. (Laughter.) Now, listen, IÃ¢ÂÂm a Bears fan. You beat us twice. But even a Bears fan has to admit --

AUDIENCE MEMBER: We got hosed!

THE PRESIDENT: -- that that was a little suspect. (Applause.) I have never seen anything like that before. I would have been pretty irritated. Were you irritated? Oh, yes. (Laughter.) But all I can say -- because IÃ¢ÂÂm used to saying this, IÃ¢ÂÂm a Bears fan -- thereÃ¢ÂÂs always next year. (Laughter.) And look, youÃ¢ÂÂve got a lot to be hopeful for. First of all, youÃ¢ÂÂve got one of the best defenses in the league. (Applause.) A fine young quarterback, Megatron. And if thereÃ¢ÂÂs one thing that you can take to the bank when talking about Detroit is that Detroit always comes back. (Applause.) Detroit always comes back. (Applause.)

And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂm here today. One of my New YearÃ¢ÂÂs resolutions is to make sure that more Americans in Wayne, more Americans in Michigan, more Americans all across this great country -- that everybody feels like theyÃ¢ÂÂre coming back. And there is no doubt, thanks to the steps that we took early on to rescue our economy and to rebuild it on a new foundation, we are entering into the New Year with new confidence that America is coming back. (Applause.)

Now, you donÃ¢ÂÂt have to take my word for it. The facts are the facts. And letÃ¢ÂÂs face it, a lot of times the media doesnÃ¢ÂÂt like reporting on good news, but every once in a while, itÃ¢ÂÂs important for us to hear some good news, not to make us complacent, but to give us confidence that if we work harder, we can make even more good news.

So hereÃ¢ÂÂs how we begin this year. Last year, 2014, was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s. (Applause.) Since the 1990s. (Applause.) WeÃ¢ÂÂve now had a 57-month streak of private sector job creation. WeÃ¢ÂÂve created nearly 11 million new jobs. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the longest stretch in our history of private sector, uninterrupted job creation. (Applause.)

HereÃ¢ÂÂs another way of thinking about it. Since 2010, we, America, have put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every other advanced economy combined. (Applause.) Combined. (Applause.) And let me tell you whatÃ¢ÂÂs leading the way: American manufacturing. After a decade of decline, American manufacturing is in its best stretch of job growth since the 1990s. Here in Michigan, manufacturers have created more than 100,000 jobs, helping to cut your unemployment rate in half.

So weÃ¢ÂÂre making more stuff. WeÃ¢ÂÂre selling it around the world. America is the number-one producer of oil, the number-one producer of gas. ItÃ¢ÂÂs helping to save drivers about a buck-ten a gallon at the pump over this time last year. (Applause.) And the cars that you make help everybody go a little further on that gallon of gas. (Applause.)

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act -- also known as Obamacare -- (applause) -- about 10 million Americans gained health insurance just over this last year. WeÃ¢ÂÂve cut our deficits by about two-thirds. IÃ¢ÂÂd like people to think about that, because when they do surveys of, like, ordinary folks on the street and they ask them, are the deficits going up or are they coming down, everybody automatically assumes, well, government spending and deficits must be going up. Deficits have come down by two-thirds since I took office -- by two-thirds. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre going down. (Applause.) And after 13 long years, our war in Afghanistan has come to a responsible end, which means more of our brave troops have come home and spent time with their families during the holidays. (Applause.)

So the point is weÃ¢ÂÂre moving. These six years have been tough, demanded hard work, demanded sacrifice on everybodyÃ¢ÂÂs part. You guys know that more than most. Which means that as a country, we have every right to be proud of what weÃ¢ÂÂve got to show for all that hard work.

AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs resurgence is real. DonÃ¢ÂÂt let anybody tell you otherwise. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got the best cards and we are doing better than just about anybody else on Earth. And now that weÃ¢ÂÂve got some calmer waters, now that the worst of the crisis is behind us, if we all do our part, if we all pitch in, then we can make sure that this rising tide is actually lifting all the boats, not just some. We can make sure that the middle class is the engine that powers American prosperity for decades to come.

And thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be the focus of my State of the Union address in a couple of weeks -- building on the progress that weÃ¢ÂÂve already made. But IÃ¢ÂÂve got to admit IÃ¢ÂÂve only got two years left in office -- I didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to wait for the State of the Union to talk about all the things that make this country great and how we can make it better. So I thought IÃ¢ÂÂd get started this week. (Applause.) I figured, why wait? ItÃ¢ÂÂs like opening your Christmas presents a little early.

So today IÃ¢ÂÂm here in Detroit, going to talk about the incredible things that have happened in the auto industry and what more we can do with manufacturing. Tomorrow, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to visit Arizona, a state that was hit about as hard as anybody by the housing crisis, because we want to talk about how we're making homeownership a reality for more middle-class families.

On Friday, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to go to Tennessee, a state that's making big strides in education, to show how we can help every American get the education they need to get ahead in this new economy.

But today, I wanted to come here to Michigan because this state proves no matter how tough times get Americans are tougher. (Applause.) Plus I wanted to see the new Mustang. (Laughter.)

Now, letÃ¢ÂÂs just take a minute and think about what you've had to fight through. A few years ago, nearly one in five autoworkers got a punch in the gut with a pink slip. The year before I took office, 400,000 jobs vanished in this industry -- 400,000. Sales plunged 40 percent. And then as the financial crisis built, we faced what once seemed unimaginable when just two of the Big Three -- GM and Chrysler -- were on the brink of failure.

Now, this is the heartbeat of American manufacturing right here. And it was flat-lining. And we had a choice to make. We could have kept giving billions of taxpayer dollars to the auto industry without asking for accountability or change in return. But that would have just kicked the problem down the road. We could have done nothing, which some people said we should do, and let those companies fail. But think about what that would have meant for this country. The suppliers, the distributors, the communities that depend on the workers who patronize the restaurants and shop at the stores, all those companies would have gone under also.

And, look, the fact is nobody was in a stronger position than Ford. Bill and the team had done a great job steering Ford through tough times, but Bill and others are the first to admit that you could have had a cascading effect if the whole supply chain in the U.S. auto industry starts declining. Then Ford could have gone under, too. Plants would have shuttered. We would have lost this iconic industry, sold for scraps. And folks like you -- the men and women who built these companies with your hands -- would have been hung out to dry. And the communities you depended on -- the schoolteachers, the small business owners, the servers in the diner and, letÃ¢ÂÂs face it, the barkeep -- (laughter and applause.) IÃ¢ÂÂm just saying. (Laughter.) Are you a barkeep, or youÃ¢ÂÂre just waving at me? (Laughter.) But everybody would have been affected. Their jobs were at stake, too.

And itÃ¢ÂÂs more than that. The jobs in the auto industry have always been about more than a paycheck. They're a source of pride for generations. It was representative of what it meant to get into the middle class. You work hard in this job, you could afford to raise a family, buy a house, go on vacation, retire with some dignity. You knew you were making something that people could count on. It meant something. Every car you sent off the line brought you that step closer to doing the right thing by your family and giving something to your kids, and having a sense of security in your life. So plants like this one built more than just cars -- they built the middle class in this country. And that was worth fighting for. (Applause.)

So in exchange for the help, we demanded responsibility. We said to the auto industry, youÃ¢ÂÂve got to change with the times. Plants retooled. Plants restructured. Labor and management worked together, settled their differences. Everybody put some skin in the game. Everybody made some sacrifices. It wasnÃ¢ÂÂt just some, it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt just the workers who gave something up -- everybody.

And that's how things work best, by the way, when everybody is in it -- when workers and businesses work together; when whoever is in the board room and folks on the floor, they both understand theyÃ¢ÂÂre in it together. And we believe America is best when everybody is in it together. And we rejected the false choice that either unions or businesses could succeed but not both. We said, you know what, whatÃ¢ÂÂs going to work for the company is also going to work for that worker, and vice versa, which means when the company is doing better, then the workers have got to get their share as well. (Applause.)

And Ford rejected the false choice that they could either take care of their shareholder or take care of their worker -- they did both. And the company benefited and America benefited. We believed in shared sacrifice and that shared sacrifice leads to shared prosperity.

Now, IÃ¢ÂÂve got to tell you, I was talking to the Detroit News -- they were asking, what was it like when you were making this decision? I just want everybody to be clear. It was not popular. Even in Michigan, it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt popular. I remember they did a poll and, like, in Michigan, it was like only 10 percent were in favor. (Laughter.) And you donÃ¢ÂÂt have to be a genius political analyst to say, 10 percent is not very high. (Laughter.)

And, look -- and it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt on my to-do list when I ran for President. I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt expecting to have to do this. But I ran not to be just doing the popular things, I ran not just to do the easy things, I ran to do the right thing. And saving the American auto industry was the right thing to do. (Applause.) Betting on you was the right thing to do. (Applause.) It was the right thing to do. And that bet has paid off for America, because the American auto industry is back. (Applause.)

Now, part of the reason that we wanted to start this trip here is not just because I wanted to see the new Mustang, not just because the American auto industry is back, but because last month we actually marked a milestone. Last month, the rescue of the auto industry officially came to an end. The auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in you. (Applause.) You paid the taxpayers back with your hard work, with your dedication. (Applause.)

And over the past five years, this industry created about 500,000 new jobs. Last year, American autoworkers churned out cars faster than any year since 2005. Ford has brought jobs back from Mexico, created nearly 24,000 new jobs across this country, including 1,800 new jobs right here in this plant. (Applause.) And after more than a century since Henry Ford introduced the moving assembly line, youÃ¢ÂÂre reinventing it -- one production line for gas, electric, hybrid, plug-in vehicles. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the first in the world, right here in Wayne, Michigan. (Applause.) First in the world. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs always cool when you do something first.

And youÃ¢ÂÂre helping rebuild the middle class for the 21st century. Just down the road in Lincoln Park, UAW-Ford Joint Apprenticeship Program is providing workers with hands-on training in the skills that employers need for the jobs of tomorrow. And nationally, by the way, 87 percent of all apprentices are employed after they complete their apprenticeship program, with an average starting wage of $50,000. So the more folks we get into apprenticeships, the more folks are getting middle-class jobs.

And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why I called on last year for businesses across the country to create more and expand more apprenticeship programs. And since then, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen the largest increase in apprenticeships in nearly a decade. And now my administration is investing $100 million in an American Apprenticeship Grant competition. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to build on this momentum. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to expand successful programs. We want young people to see that they have opportunities. They donÃ¢ÂÂt all have to go to a four-year college. They can get an apprenticeship, save some money, start working -- (applause) -- build a family, buy a home, get some Lions tickets. (Laughter and applause.)

Because everybody came together here and worked together, folks are better off. And some of the most high-tech, fuel-efficient, high-powered, heart-pounding, good-looking, well-designed, fuel-efficient cars in the world are once again designed, engineered, forged and built not in Europe, not in Asia, right here in the United States of America. (Applause.) Right here in America. (Applause.)

So because of you -- because of you, manufacturing has a future in this country. Management has actually grown faster than other parts of the economy. And companies are now saying, you know what, we got to get back to America. We got to relocate. We were offshore, and now they're saying, oh, oh, America is back. We better get back in there. And that means because of you, the middle class has a future in this country.

And the auto industry has proved that any comeback is possible -- and by the way, so has Motor City. (Applause.) So has a Motor City. (Applause.) A year and a half ago, Detroit became the largest city ever to file for bankruptcy. Today, under the leadership of Mayor Duggan, Detroit is charting a new course. Businesses and private investors are making big investments, including Ford, which is helping to launch a tech startup incubator downtown. New restaurants and stores are popping up. Residents are fighting blight, securing abandoned homes, cleaning up neglected neighborhoods.

WeÃ¢ÂÂre seeing stories of young people who left town for other opportunities, didn't think they could make it here, and suddenly they're saying, you know what, maybe I want to get back to Detroit -- hoping to be part of the rebirth of this city.

Now, this city still faces big challenges, but youÃ¢ÂÂre coming back. Just like the auto industry is going to have to continue to come up with new ideas and new designs and address competition. It never stops. We got to stay hungry. We can't be complacent. Just like America has got to still keep on working. Just like the Lions got to still come up with a little more work. (Applause.) But we're coming back.

And one thing is for sure -- we may not all root for the Lions, but America is rooting for Detroit. (Applause.) America is rooting for Detroit. (Applause.) We want the Motor City strong. And behind the stories of plants and cities and economic data, itÃ¢ÂÂs people. ItÃ¢ÂÂs all of you.

So IÃ¢ÂÂll just close with a story of a guy named Ramone -- because weÃ¢ÂÂre rooting for guys like Ramone. Ramone spent eight years in the military, served in Afghanistan, served in Iraq. Ramone here? Raise your hand, Ramone. (Applause.)

So Ramone is somebody who fought for our freedom, fought for our security. But sometimes we give lip service to supporting our troops, and then when they come home they get lost. So when Ramone came home, he had a hard time finding a job because it was a tough economy. He didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to be a burden on his family, so he moved into a homeless shelter, took whatever work he could get. And then, one day in 2012, a VA counselor that heÃ¢ÂÂd been working with handed him an application from Ford. Ford was hiring for new shifts.

Imagine what Ramone felt the day he knocked on his grandpaÃ¢ÂÂs door -- his grandfather who had spent 25 years building Mustangs in Dearborn -- and Ramone was able to tell his grandfather he got a job at Ford. (Applause.) And now Ramone has got his own place. And now Ramone has got a good job right on the line here in Wayne. And every day, heÃ¢ÂÂs doing just what his grandfather did. And heÃ¢ÂÂs proud. HeÃ¢ÂÂs punching in and building some of the best cars in the world. (Applause.)

If you want to know what America is about, about grit and determination and hard work and sacrifice and looking out for one another and not giving up, think about Ramone. Think about Detroit. Think about the auto industry. Think about the Midwest. Think about Michigan. Think about America.

When our assembly lines grind to a halt, we work together, we get them going again. We donÃ¢ÂÂt give up. We get up, we fight back. We come back stronger than before. Thanks to the hard work of people like you, America is coming back. And IÃ¢ÂÂm going to be on your side every step of the way. (Applause.)

Thank you, Michigan. God bless you. God bless America. (Applause.)

243	"WASHINGTON Ã¢ÂÂ Rod Jay Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice has been removed from his office.

Nearly everyone who knows him seems to agree that Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General and the official overseeing the special counsel Robert MuellerÃ¢ÂÂs investigation of links between the Trump campaign and Russia, has a reputation for integrity.

Rod who is described by Jim Trusty, the former head of the Justice DepartmentÃ¢ÂÂs organized-crime division as a prosecutor, not a persecutor, had sought earlier to protect his good image by not taking a hastened decision to fire anyone without justifiable reasons.

But Trump could not fire Mueller directly, according to the law that authorizes MuellerÃ¢ÂÂs probe, so the only possible way is to throw the Justice Department into upheaval by firing Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein who only holds the key MuellerÃ¢ÂÂs expulsion.

Only the person acting as attorney general, and Rod Rosenstein who was on matters related to the probe, could fire Mueller, and he said he wonÃ¢ÂÂt do it without Ã¢ÂÂgood cause.Ã¢ÂÂ So Trump would first had to purge the upper ranks of the Justice Department until he finds someone willing to follow his orders and dismiss the special counsel.

Conflicting reports claim Rosenstein had resigned but itÃ¢ÂÂs understood that Donald Trump made the decision to remove him after a review from his chief of staff, John Kelly.

UNDER the best of circumstancesÃ¢ÂÂwhen America has a president who is disciplined, willing to hear harsh but necessary truths and loyal to those he trustsÃ¢ÂÂthe post of Attorney General is Ã¢ÂÂperhaps one of the most powerful job in WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂ, according to Loretta Lynch. Loretta Elizabeth Lynch, an American attorney who served as the 83rd Attorney General of the United States, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2015 to succeed Eric Holder. Loretta Lynch, a political giant who held that post for Barack Obama said, under ideal conditions, it is also the Ã¢ÂÂtoughest job in government.Ã¢ÂÂ

Rosenstein, the hapless establishment Republican ousted as Deputy Attorney General on Monday December 4, 2017 lasted a smidgeon over few days. After days of increasingly public concerns over the likelihood of MuellerÃ¢ÂÂs dismissal by Trump and amidst TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs former national-security adviser, Michael Flynn, had pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal investigators about his conversations with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition, Mr Rosenstein is being replaced by Neil Gorsuch, who was recently nominated by Trump for a lifetime job on the U.S. Supreme Court.

The reshuffle puts Mr Rosenstein out of his misery and confirms Mr TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs fondness for surrounding himself with tough-as-nails generals, who already fill several top jobs in his government. It ends the fear of Trump administration being damaged by FlynnÃ¢ÂÂs plea to MuellerÃ¢ÂÂs investigation team.

These are not anything like ideal circumstances for Mr Neil Gorsuch. New holder of the toughest job in government, the ex-clerk for Judge David B. Sentelle on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992, and then for U.S. Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, from 1993 to 1994. He currently was serving as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. How long Mr Neil Gorsuch lasts is anyoneÃ¢ÂÂs guess. If he only emerges with his dignity intact and adhere to the orders and principles of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs administration, he will have done better than his predecessor.

President Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs interview with the New York Times on Wednesday stirred speculation he might consider firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller for investigating TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs business dealings as part of the Russia probe.

But Trump could not fire Mueller directly, according to the law that authorizes MuellerÃ¢ÂÂs probe. Firing the Deputy Attorney General simply means setting off a chain-reaction that would throw the Justice Department into upheaval and consequently reaching his target to fire Robert Mueller under his dictatorship.

HeÃ¢ÂÂd certainly begun by dismissing Rosenstein, whose political loyalties Trump questioned in the Times interview on Wednesday in which he also warned Mueller against broadening his investigation. Such a scenario would parallel President Richard NixonÃ¢ÂÂs 1973 Ã¢ÂÂSaturday Night Massacre,Ã¢ÂÂ when Nixon forced out the top two officials in the Justice Department in order to oust the Watergate special counsel.

Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt think thatÃ¢ÂÂs politically survivable, and itÃ¢ÂÂs not clear how much collateral damage he will do, putting himself into a position to have somebody fire Mueller,Ã¢ÂÂ said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island.

Expanding Investigation

MuellerÃ¢ÂÂs investigation has expanded to examine a broad range of transactions involving the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs businesses, including dealings by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a person familiar with the probe told Bloomberg News. Trump told the Times that if Mueller examined his familyÃ¢ÂÂs finances beyond any relationship with Russia heÃ¢ÂÂd consider it Ã¢ÂÂa violation.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThere is no possible way anybody at the White House could be seriously thinking about firing Mueller,Ã¢ÂÂ said Senate Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt even want to comment on that because thatÃ¢ÂÂs so far out of bounds it couldnÃ¢ÂÂt possibly be a serious discussion.Ã¢ÂÂ

Undercutting Mueller

Trump has indicated he would try to undercut MuellerÃ¢ÂÂs credibility. In the New York Times interview, Trump said Mueller has Ã¢ÂÂmany other conflicts that I havenÃ¢ÂÂt said, but I will at some point.Ã¢ÂÂ

Separately, the Washington Post reported Thursday night that TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs legal team was exploring ways to question Mueller by building a case that he has conflicts of interest in overseeing the investigation. The Post also cited one unidentified person familiar with the effort as saying that Trump has asked his advisers about his authority to grant pardons to aides, family members or even himself."	1
244	"The Kardashian family has a net worth in the hundreds of millions, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre using their wealth to step up in a big way for those in need. The reality TV family banded together to raise $1 million to the families of victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting.

Earlier today, we announced that the Kardashian family will be donating $1 million to the victims of Las Vegas mass shooting, considering both the bereaved and the surviving victims.

Also, to benefit those impacted by the shooting, the Kardashian family will be hosting a Ã¢ÂÂDay of GivingÃ¢ÂÂ on October 7. A Ã¢ÂÂDay of GivingÃ¢ÂÂ will begin on Friday morning with other American celebrities and continue throughout the day on E!News. Across our social platforms, there will be a #DayofGiving call-to-action to donate to the victims of Las vegas shooting, with those dollars going to benefit those most impacted, the statement read.

Ã¢ÂÂOur hearts go out to everyone in the devastating path of this historic mass shooting,Ã¢ÂÂ said Kim Kardashian. The most decorated family said itÃ¢ÂÂs hard to fully appreciate the impact, in part because people are still recovering from the historic tragedy. But we know several people have been bereaved or victimized and now face the daunting challenge of putting lives and communities back together fearsomely, and weÃ¢ÂÂre using our unique resources and reach to help those in need.Ã¢ÂÂ-the family continued.

Ã¢ÂÂLas Vegas we are praying for you,Ã¢ÂÂ KhloÃÂ© Kardashian tweeted immediately after announcing the familyÃ¢ÂÂs donation.

More than 50 people were killed and more than 500 more injured in a terrifying massacre Sunday night. ItÃ¢ÂÂs being reported by outlets as the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States.

A gunman, now identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, opened fire on a country-music festival from a hotel window inside the nearby Mandalay Bay. Paddock shot and killed himself; Las Vegas Metro Police officers found him dead in the room.

Our thoughts and prayers remain with the people of Las Vegas and again itÃ¢ÂÂs our most fervent prayer we get enough security to make life fright-free again in the Nevada city."	1

Rumors are that Donald Trump might pick John Bolton for Secretary of State. Heaven forbid.

One of the things I occasionally liked about the President-elect was his opposition to the Iraq war and regime change. He not only grasped the mistake of that war early, but also seemed to fully understand how it disrupted the balance of power in the Middle East and even emboldened Iran.

We liberated Iraq, but today their best friend is Iran, their second greatest ally is Russia, and their third strongest alliance is with Syria. Trump really seems to get the lesson. Hillary Clinton never did.

RELATED: Rand Paul: The president cannot use out-of-date authorities to send our troops to war

Most importantly right now, John Bolton never learned and never will.

Bolton is a longtime member of the failed Washington elite that Trump vowed to oppose, hell-bent on repeating virtually every foreign policy mistake the U.S. has made in the last 15 years Ã¢ÂÂ particularly those Trump promised to avoid as president.

John Bolton more often stood with Hillary Clinton and against what Donald Trump has advised.

None of this is secret. ItÃ¢ÂÂs all out there. Perhaps the incoming administration should take a closer look.

Bolton was one of the loudest advocates of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and still stupefyingly insists it was the right call 13 years later. Ã¢ÂÂI still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,Ã¢ÂÂ Bolton said just last year.

Trump, rightly, believes that decision was a colossal mistake that destabilized the region. Ã¢ÂÂIraq used to be no terrorists,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump said in 2015. Ã¢ÂÂ(N)ow itÃ¢ÂÂs the Harvard of terrorism.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂIf you look at Iraq from years ago, IÃ¢ÂÂm not saying he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump said of Saddam Hussein, Ã¢ÂÂbut it was a lot better than it is right now.Ã¢ÂÂ

Trump has said U.S. intervention in Iraq in 2003 Ã¢ÂÂhelped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper.Ã¢ÂÂ In contrast, Bolton has said explicitly that he wants to repeat Iraq-style regime change in Syrian and Iran.

You canÃ¢ÂÂt learn from mistakes if you donÃ¢ÂÂt see mistakes.

Trump has blamed George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for helping to create ISIS Ã¢ÂÂ but should add John Bolton to that list, who essentially agreed with all three on our regime change debacles.

In 2011, Bolton bashed Obama Ã¢ÂÂfor his refusal to directly target GaddafiÃ¢ÂÂ and declared, Ã¢ÂÂthere is a strategic interest in toppling GaddafiÃ¢ÂÂ¦ But Obama missed it.Ã¢ÂÂ In fact, Obama actually took BoltonÃ¢ÂÂs advice and bombed the Libyan dictator into the next world. Secretary of State Clinton bragged, Ã¢ÂÂWe came, we saw, he died.Ã¢ÂÂ

When Trump was asked last year if Libya and the region would be more stable today with Gaddafi in power, he replied Ã¢ÂÂ100 percent.Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Trump is 100 percent right.

No man is more out of touch with the situation in the Middle East or more dangerous to our national security than Bolton.

All nuance is lost on the man. The fact that Russia has had a base in Syria for 50 years doesnÃ¢ÂÂt deter Bolton from calling for all out, no holds barred war in Syria. Bolton criticized the current administration for offering only a tepid war. For Bolton, only a hot-blooded war to create democracy across the globe is demanded.

Woodrow Wilson would be proud, but the parents of our soldiers should be mortified. War should be the last resort, never the first. War should be understood to be a hell no one wishes for. Dwight Eisenhower understood this when he wrote, Ã¢ÂÂI hate war like only a soldier can, the stupidity, the banality, the futility.Ã¢ÂÂ

Bolton would not understand this because, like many of his generation, he used every privilege to avoid serving himself. Bolton said, with the threat of the Vietnam draft over his head, that Ã¢ÂÂhe had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy.Ã¢ÂÂ But heÃ¢ÂÂs seems to be okay with your son or daughter dying wherever his neoconservative impulse leads us: Ã¢ÂÂEven before the Iraq War, John Bolton was a leading brain behind the neoconservativesÃ¢ÂÂ war-and-conquest agenda,Ã¢ÂÂ notes The American ConservativeÃ¢ÂÂs Jon Utley.

At a time when Americans thirst for change and new thinking, Bolton is an old hand at failed foreign policy.

The man is a menace.

RELATED: Rand Paul says RepublicansÃ¢ÂÂ top priority will be to repeal Obamacare

Our Constitution and our founding fathers were explicit war was not to be fought without the permission of Congress. No matter which party occupies the White House, I will not shrink from my constitutional duty to oppose any advocate for war.

The true statesmen realizes, with reluctance, that war is sometimes necessary but as a country, we should resist any would-be leader who wants to bomb now and think later.

President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on changing our disastrous foreign policy. To appoint John Bolton would be a major first step toward breaking that promise.

247	"CLEVELAND Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump, on the eve of accepting the Republican nomination for president, explicitly raised new questions on Wednesday about his commitment to automatically defending NATO allies if they are attacked, saying he would first look at their contributions to the alliance.

Asked about RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs threatening activities, which have unnerved the small Baltic States that are among the more recent entrants into NATO, Mr. Trump said that if Russia attacked them, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing if those nations have Ã¢ÂÂfulfilled their obligations to us.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂIf they fulfill their obligations to us,Ã¢ÂÂ he added, Ã¢ÂÂthe answer is yes.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mr. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs statement appeared to be the first time that a major candidate for president had suggested conditioning the United StatesÃ¢ÂÂ defense of its major allies. It was consistent, however, with his previous threat to withdraw American forces from Europe and Asia if those allies fail to pay more for American protection.

Mr. Trump also said he would not pressure Turkey or other authoritarian allies about conducting purges of their political adversaries or cracking down on civil liberties. The United States, he said, has to Ã¢ÂÂfix our own messÃ¢ÂÂ before trying to alter the behavior of other nations."	0

5:35 P.M. EDT

MR. BARDEN: Hello. My name is Mark Barden. Just four months ago, my wife Jackie and I lost our son, and our children, James and Natalie, they lost their little brother Daniel. Daniel was a first-grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our sweet, 7-year-old Daniel was one of 20 children, six adults lost on December 14th. I have to say it feels like it was just yesterday.

In our deepest grief, we were supported by the love of our families and comforted by the love and prayers we received from millions of America, from every corner of the country.

What happened in Newtown can happen anywhere. In any instant, any dad in America could be in my shoes. No one should feel the pain. No one should feel our pain or the pain felt by the tens of thousands of people whoÃ¢ÂÂve lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.

And that's why we're here. Two weeks ago, 12 of us from Newtown came to meet with U.S. senators and have a conversation about how to bring common-sense solutions to the issues of gun violence. We came with a sense of hope, optimistic that real conversation could begin that would ultimately save the lives of so many Americans. We met with dozens of Democrats and Republicans and shared with them pictures of our children, our spouses, our parents who lost their lives on December 14th.

Expanded background checks wouldn't have saved our loved ones, but still we came to support the bipartisan proposal from two senators, both with Ã¢ÂÂAÃ¢ÂÂ ratings from the NRA -- a common-sense proposal supported by 90 percent of Americans. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a proposal that will save lives without interfering with the rights of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.

We'll return home now, disappointed but not defeated. We return home with the determination that change will happen -- maybe not today, but it will happen. It will happen soon. We've always known this would be a long road, and we don't have the luxury of turning back. We will keep moving forward and build public support for common-sense solutions in the areas of mental health, school safety, and gun safety.

We take strength from the children and loved ones that we lost, and we carry a great faith in the American people.

On behalf of the Sandy Hook Promise, I would like to thank President Obama, Vice President Biden for their leadership and for standing strong and continuing to fight for a safer America. I would like to thank Senators Toomey, Manchin, Schumer and Kirk on coming together to seek common ground on legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and save lives.

And I would like to thank ConnecticutÃ¢ÂÂs Senators Blumenthal and Murphy. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve been right with us. They stood by us right from the very beginning. From the first few hours after this tragedy they were with us.

We will not be defeated. We are not defeated, and we will not be defeated. We are here now; we will always be here because we have no other choice. We are not going away. And every day, as more people are killed in this country because of gun violence, our determination grows stronger.

We leave Washington hoping that others, both here and across the country, will join us in making the Sandy Hook Promise, a pledge that we'd had great hope that more U.S. senators would take literally. I'd like to end by repeating the words with which the Sandy Hook Promise begins: Our hearts are broken. Our spirit is not.

Thank you. It is now my great pleasure to introduce the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.

THE PRESIDENT: A few months ago, in response to too many tragedies -- including the shootings of a United States Congresswoman, Gabby Giffords, whoÃ¢ÂÂs here today, and the murder of 20 innocent schoolchildren and their teachers Ã¢ÂÂ- this country took up the cause of protecting more of our people from gun violence.

Families that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders Ã¢ÂÂ- not just to honor the memory of their children, but to protect the lives of all our children. And a few minutes ago, a minority in the United States Senate decided it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt worth it. They blocked common-sense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the Senate gallery.

By now, itÃ¢ÂÂs well known that 90 percent of the American people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun. WeÃ¢ÂÂre talking about convicted felons, people convicted of domestic violence, people with a severe mental illness. Ninety percent of Americans support that idea. Most Americans think that's already the law.

And a few minutes ago, 90 percent of Democrats in the Senate just voted for that idea. But itÃ¢ÂÂs not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate just voted against that idea.

A majority of senators voted Ã¢ÂÂyesÃ¢ÂÂ to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks. But by this continuing distortion of Senate rules, a minority was able to block it from moving forward.

IÃ¢ÂÂm going to speak plainly and honestly about whatÃ¢ÂÂs happened here because the American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen. We had a Democrat and a Republican -Ã¢ÂÂ both gun owners, both fierce defenders of our Second Amendment, with Ã¢ÂÂAÃ¢ÂÂ grades from the NRA -- come together and worked together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks. And I want to thank Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their courage in doing that. That was not easy given their traditional strong support for Second Amendment rights.

As they said, nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our Second Amendment rights. All it did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the Internet. So 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system; this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system.

Their legislation showed respect for gun owners, and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence. And Gabby Giffords, by the way, is both -- sheÃ¢ÂÂs a gun owner and a victim of gun violence. She is a Westerner and a moderate. And she supports these background checks.

In fact, even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. The current leader of the NRA used to support these background checks. So while this compromise didnÃ¢ÂÂt contain everything I wanted or everything that these families wanted, it did represent progress. It represented moderation and common sense. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why 90 percent of the American people supported it.

But instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill. They claimed that it would create some sort of Ã¢ÂÂbig brotherÃ¢ÂÂ gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didnÃ¢ÂÂt matter.

And unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators. And I talked to several of these senators over the past few weeks, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre all good people. I know all of them were shocked by tragedies like Newtown. And I also understand that they come from states that are strongly pro-gun. And I have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns, and that both sides have to listen to each other.

But the fact is most of these senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun. There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt do this. It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment.

And obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse -- any excuse -- to vote Ã¢ÂÂno.Ã¢ÂÂ

One common argument I heard was that this legislation wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt prevent all future massacres. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs true. As I said from the start, no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil. We learned that tragically just two days ago. But if action by Congress could have saved one person, one child, a few hundred, a few thousand -- if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our Second Amendment rights, we had an obligation to try.

And this legislation met that test. And too many senators failed theirs.

I've heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory. And my question is, a victory for who? A victory for what? All that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check. That didnÃ¢ÂÂt make our kids safer. Victory for not doing something that 90 percent of Americans, 80 percent of Republicans, the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done? It begs the question, who are we here to represent?

I've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced. ""A prop,"" somebody called them. Ã¢ÂÂEmotional blackmail,Ã¢ÂÂ some outlet said. Are they serious? Do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence donÃ¢ÂÂt have a right to weigh in on this issue? Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?

So all in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington.

But this effort is not over. I want to make it clear to the American people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people donÃ¢ÂÂt give up on it. Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to address the barriers that prevent states from participating in the existing background check system. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns so it can do its job. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to help to put in place emergency plans to protect our children in their schools.

But we can do more if Congress gets its act together. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters.

To all the people who supported this legislation -- law enforcement and responsible gun owners, Democrats and Republicans, urban moms, rural hunters, whoever you are -- you need to let your representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and that if they donÃ¢ÂÂt act this time, you will remember come election time.

To the wide majority of NRA households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in Washington know they didnÃ¢ÂÂt represent your views on this one.

The point is those who care deeply about preventing more and more gun violence will have to be as passionate, and as organized, and as vocal as those who blocked these common-sense steps to help keep our kids safe. Ultimately, you outnumber those who argued the other way. But they're better organized. They're better financed. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve been at it longer. And they make sure to stay focused on this one issue during election time. And that's the reason why you can have something that 90 percent of Americans support and you can't get it through the Senate or the House of Representatives.

So to change Washington, you, the American people, are going to have to sustain some passion about this. And when necessary, youÃ¢ÂÂve got to send the right people to Washington. And that requires strength, and it requires persistence.

And that's the one thing that these families should have inspired in all of us. I still don't know how they have been able to muster up the strength to do what theyÃ¢ÂÂve doing over the last several weeks, last several months.

And I see this as just round one. When Newtown happened, I met with these families and I spoke to the community, and I said, something must be different right now. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to change. That's what the whole country said. Everybody talked about how we were going to change something to make sure this didn't happen again, just like everybody talked about how we needed to do something after Aurora. Everybody talked about we needed change something after Tucson.

And IÃ¢ÂÂm assuming that the emotions that weÃ¢ÂÂve all felt since Newtown, the emotions that weÃ¢ÂÂve all felt since Tucson and Aurora and Chicago -- the pain we share with these families and families all across the country whoÃ¢ÂÂve lost a loved one to gun violence -- IÃ¢ÂÂm assuming that's not a temporary thing. IÃ¢ÂÂm assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.

I believe weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of these children demand it. And so do the American people.

Thank you very much, everybody.

252	"President Donald Trump has finally given Congress the authorization to pursue charges against Hillary Clinton.

Jason Chaffetz, the Chairman of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, informed the committee that he had a meeting with President Trump who gave him permission to investigate whatever he wants. Chaffetz also hinted that charges against Hillary could be happening soon.

Here is what Chaffetz said:

Ã¢ÂÂPresident Trump visited Philadelphia when we were at our planning and strategy session. I went backstage with the President. HereÃ¢ÂÂs what he said: Ã¢ÂÂYou do a great job. Listen, I understand IÃ¢ÂÂm the president and you have a job. You do the oversight. DonÃ¢ÂÂt slow down. Go after everything you want to go after. You look at everything you want to look at.Ã¢ÂÂ If you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight and government, you would be inspired. And for him to convey a message of Ã¢ÂÂdonÃ¢ÂÂt slow down,Ã¢ÂÂ I think was a good message.Ã¢ÂÂ

WATCH:

The news that President Trump supports the investigation comes just days after the Oversight Committee ordered James Comey, (now former) FBI Director, to release the contents of Hillary ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs email server. This means that the lawless and reckless behavior of Hillary Clinton hasnÃ¢ÂÂt yet escaped from a full-blown investigation.

Without Obama and Comey to cover her back now, Hillary Clinton may finally be indicted. ItÃ¢ÂÂs about time she is held responsible for her countless crimes and for betraying our country. She has to answer for that, and now that President Trump is in control, she wonÃ¢ÂÂt make it out of this investigation so easily.

256	"PWNED: House GOP Dominates Twitter, YouTube, Social Media in Congress

Democrats Innovate by Finding New Places to Ignore the Will of the America People



Washington, Jan 22 - The conventional wisdom is being turned upside down as House Republicans demonstrate an unmatched ability to connect with the American people on the InternetÃ¢ÂÂs most popular communities. Once considered the party of online innovation, new research and a host of media reports show that Democrats are largely ignoring some of the most popular social media communities on the web. Recent data shows that nearly 50 percent of adults are active on social networks, nearly two-thirds watch online videos on sites such as YouTube, while over seven million people have joined the fastest-growing online member community, Twitter. Apparently no one has faxed that data to congressional Democrats, however, as the vast majority has yet to incorporate many of these popular technologies into their day-to-day communications. Meanwhile, House Republicans, seeing a unique opportunity to communicate directly with the American people without the traditional media filters of the past, are busy forging new connections with their constituents online. A recently-released report, Twongress: The Power of Twitter in Congress shows us the most glaring example of this party disparity:



Ã¢ÂÂMore Republicans Use Twitter Than Democrats - In Congress, there are 132 members who are using Twitter actively: 89 Republicans and 43 Democrats..in the House, there are 75 Republicans using Twitter (42.13 percent of the Republican Caucus) and 32 Democrats (12.45 percent of the Democratic Caucus).""

But Twitter isnÃ¢ÂÂt the only online community dominated by Republicans. Even as they find themselves in a 40 seat minority, House RepublicansÃ¢ÂÂ videos consistently outperform those of their counterparts on YouTube. The below chart, provided by industry analyst TubeMogul, illustrates this significant gap:







Congressional DemocratsÃ¢ÂÂ constituents arenÃ¢ÂÂt the only ones that canÃ¢ÂÂt find them online. The national media continues to chronicle the Republican advantage and the DemocratsÃ¢ÂÂ lack of interest in social media:

257	"At 5:28 PM EST on Jan. 11, 2007, a satellite arced over southern China. It was smallÃ¢ÂÂjust 6 ft. longÃ¢ÂÂa tiny object in the heavens, steadily bleeping its location to ground stations below, just as it had every day for the past seven years. And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft.

It was not the start of the world's first war in space, but it could have been. It was just a test: The satellite was a defunct Chinese weather spacecraft. And the country that destroyed it was China. According to reports, a mobile launcher at the Songlin test facility near Xichang, in Sichuan province, lofted a multistage solid-fuel missile topped with a kinetic kill vehicle. Traveling nearly 18,000 mph, the kill vehicle intercepted the sat andÃ¢ÂÂboomÃ¢ÂÂobliterated it. ""It was almost just a dead-reckoning flight with little control over the intercept path,"" says Phillip S. Clark, an independent British authority who has written widely on the Chinese and Russian space programs.

For China, a nation that has already sent humans into space and developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), the technology involved in the test was hardly remarkable. But as a demonstration of a rising military posture, it was a surprisingly aggressive act, especially since China has long pushed for an international treaty banning space weapons. ""The move was a dangerous step toward the abyss of weaponizing space,"" says Theresa Hitchens, director of the Center for Defense Information, an independent defense research group in Washington, D.C. ""China held the moral high ground about space, and that test re-energized the China hawks in Congress. If we're not careful, space could become the new Wild West. You don't just go and blow things up there."" In fact, after the Chinese test, India publicly stepped up its development of antiÃÂÃÂ­satellite technology. And some Israeli officials have argued that, given China's record of selling missile technology to Iran, Israel should develop its own program.

INTERNATIONAL THREAT

For many countries, the most disturbing aspect of the test was not the potentially destabilizing sat kill, but the resulting debris, which poses a serious threat to every satellite in orbit, as well as to the International Space Station. ""Space debris is a huge problem,"" says Laura Grego, staff scientist in the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""A 1-centimeter object is very hard to track but can do considerable damage if it collides with any spacecraft at a high rate of speed."" Think of a shotgun pellet traveling at 10 times the speed of a bullet, smashing into a device built to be as light as possible. And then consider that China's antisatellite (ASAT) test produced as many as 35,000 of these pellets, or pieces of debris, in the 1-cm range. Nearly 1500 pieces were 10 cm and larger.

Although the United States knew that China was planning to test ASAT technology, administration officialsÃ¢ÂÂreluctant to disclose the level of U.S. surveillanceÃ¢ÂÂchose to say nothing. China failed two or three times before successfully launching the missile in January. All the attempts were observed by the U.S. Air Force satellite system known as the Defense Support Program. Infrared telescopes on these 33-ft.-high defense satellites can spot the plumes from rockets launched anywhere on Earth.

2] Experts believe a four-stage, solidÃÂÃÂ­-fuel launch vehicleÃ¢ÂÂthought by American officials to be based on China's KT-2Ã¢ÂÂboosted the kill vehicle into orbit.

3] The Feng-Yun 1C target vehicle was launched May 10, 1999, with a two-year active life span. The 1650-pound polar-orbiting weather satellite was equipped with two 10-band scanning radiometers for Earth observation.

4] The kinetic-energy kill vehicle was traveling nearly 18,000 mph when it struck the satellite.

5] The collision blasted debris throughout low Earth orbit. Within 7 hours, a band of debris had spread halfway around the globe.

AMERICA'S OWN SAT KILLS

Every industrialized country relies on satellites every day, for everything from computer networking technology to telecommunications, navigation, weather prediction, television and radio. This makes satellites especially vulnerable targets. Imagine the U.S. military suddenly without guidance for its soldiers and weapons systems, and its civilians without storm warnings or telephones.

Some satellites, however, are at greater risk than others. Most spacecraft -- including spy sats -- are in low Earth orbit, which stretches 1240 miles into space. As the Chinese test proved, such targets could be hit with medium-range missiles tipped with crude kill devices. GPS satellites are far higher, orbiting at about 12,600 miles. Many communications sats are in the 22,000-mile range. Destroying them requires a much more powerful and sophisticated long-range ballistic missile -- yet it can be done. ""You'd need a sky-sweeping capability to comprehensively negate a space support system that is scattered all over,"" says John Pike, a space analyst at GlobalSecurity.org. ""You'd need ICBM-size boosters -- hundreds of them.""

Such an all-out satellite war would render space useless for decades to come. ""There'd be so much debris up there,"" Clark says, ""that it wouldn't be safe to put anything up in space.""

The United States and Russia, the two countries with proven ASAT capabilities, have long steered clear of satellites as military targets. Even during the Cold War spy sats were hands-off; the consequences of destroying them were greater than those of unwelcome surveillance. ""The consensus,"" Clark says, ""was that anybody could look at anybody else.""

Diagram: China's antisatellite strike took place at an altitude of 537 miles, which places the international spacecraft depicted below well within range of China's space arsenal.

Nevertheless, the U.S. military has spent decades designing weapons capable of killing other countries' satellites. The crudest American ASAT test, code-named Starfish Prime, took place in 1962, when the U.S. Air Force detonated a 1.4-megaton nuclear weapon at an altitude of 250 miles. The explosion, which occurred about 800 miles west of Hawaii, disabled at least six U.S. and foreign satellites -- roughly a third of the world's low Earth orbit total. The resulting electromagnetic pulse knocked out 300 streetlights in Oahu. Clearly, nukes worked as ASAT weapons, but far too indiscriminately.

To develop a more surgical capability, the Air Force launched Project Mudflap, which was designed to destroy individual Soviet satellites with missiles. But inaccurate space-guidance systems plagued early tests. Then, on May 23, 1963, the Air Force pulled off a successful intercept with a modified Nike-Zeus ballistic missile launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It took out a rendezvous and docking target for NASA's Gemini missions at an altitude of 150 miles.

Over the next several decades the Air Force graduated to more sophisticated air-launched missiles that could hit targets with far better accuracy. In 1985 the United States destroyed an American solar observation satellite using a three-stage, heat-seeking miniature vehicle fired from an F-15 fighter jet. That test, like the Chinese one earlier this year, used a kinetic kill vehicle that spewed debris into space. Funding for the program was cancelled before the air-launched system could be perfected.

That same year, at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the Air Force began operating the powerful Mid-Infrared Chemical Laser. In 1997, it was used to temporarily blind sensors on an Air Force missile-launch and tracking satellite. The sat remained intact; no debris was created. And no laser tests have been conducted since. However, the current federal budget includes funding for a laser to be fired at a low Earth orbit sat from the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base, in New Mexico, later this year.

Some $400 million has been spent in recent years to develop another sophisticated kill vehicle -- a three-stage missile that smacks an enemy's craft with a sheet of Mylar plastic, disabling it without producing any debris. It has yet to be fully tested, and would only work on satellites in low Earth orbit; communication and GPS sats are too high.

Destroying an adversary's satellites has far-reaching implications. Do you take out only military sats or so-called civilian ones, too? Nearly every satellite has dual uses: A civilian weather satellite used for tracking hurricanes also could watch military movements. Many satellites are used by multiple nations. And once a nation disables an adversary's satellites, it puts its own in peril. As Charles Vick, a senior analyst at GlobalÃÂÃÂ­Security says, ""It's an act of war.""

U.S. Sat Kill Arsenal

--Davin Coburn

1] Perhaps the most spectacular test -- known as Starfish Prime -- occurred on July 9, 1962, when a 1.4-megaton nuclear warhead was detonated 250 miles above the Pacific. Radiation and electromagnetic pulses disabled at least six satellites and created an eerie, artificial glow for 20 minutes.

2] The U.S. conducted its only direct antisat test in 1985, when an F-15 climbed to 80,000 ft., then fired a three-stage missile. It caught up to a 17,500-mph Solwind solar observation satellite at an altitude of nearly 300 miles over Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

3] In 1997 the U.S. Army hover-tested a kinetic energy weapon that could act like a space-age fly swatter. The kill vehicle extends a Mylar sheet to disable satellites without destroying them. The military found the technology too messy, and eventually canceled the program.

4] The XSS-11 microsatellite isn't an antisat -- but it could be. First launched in April 2005, the spacecraft is designed to circumnavigate targets and relay diagnostic data. Some experts note that it wouldn't be difficult to reprogram the craft to ram into enemy targets.

SENDING A MESSAGE

So why did China risk provoking international hostility? The country's government has been opaque. ""The experiment is not targeted at any other country,"" said a foreign ministry spokeswoman in Beijing.

Some experts think at least part of China's motivation lies in an unclassified 2006 U.S. report on the future of military activities in space. The document reaffirms that ""The United States considers space capabilities ... vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities, and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so ... and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests.""

The United States ""basically said it has the right to restrict the use of space to only its allies,"" Clark says. Adds Jeffrey G. Lewis, an arms control expert at the New America Foundation: ""Much of the world was appalled at the tone of the policy. One British newspaper columnist basically said it made space the 51st state.""

In that context, some experts say, the Chinese test was an effort to force the issue, to show the United States the potential consequences of refusing to negotiate a favorable treaty on the military use of space. ""The U.S. was restricting all these arms treaties,"" says Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in security studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. ""For the Chinese, [the test] was an effort to deal from a position of strength.""

Pike believes China may have another rationale for flexing its space muscle: Taiwan. China has long yearned to reabsorb the breakaway island state, which the United States has pledged to defend. In the short term, Pike says, China has only two strategies that could lead to a Taiwan takeover. It could bluff the U.S. in a nuclear confrontation, or it could try something altogether different: Fire medium-range missiles from mobile launchers, just as it did in the January test, and take out America's low-flying imaging satellites. Doing so might blind U.S. military planners long enough for Chinese military forces to gain a foothold on the island.

""The Chinese stage these big amphibious exercises off Taiwan all the time. One day, maybe it'll be real,"" Pike says. ""Either the U.S. will get there quickly enough to stop them or the Chinese will win the race and there won't be the American political resolve to kick them out. All the Chinese would need is time."" A half-dozen sats, Pike says -- that's all it would take. ""Those satellites are low-hanging fruit. It's a no-brainer.""

In that scenario, the ASAT test was not really about China showing the United States its capability. It was about China confirming that its own war plan is feasible.

AMERICA'S TRUMP CARD

The long-term ramifications of the test will take years to play out, but, for now, few observers think China scored any gains. ""It was a mistake,"" O'Hanlon says. It fueled American hard-liners who want to restrict American technological cooperation with China. And, ""It doesn't help China's case saying it isn't a threatening military power,"" Vick says. ""It is a threat, and the test showed that."" Whether the United States suddenly accelerates its ASAT capability beyond the testing phase remains to be seen. The country is in the midst of a war; budgets are already tight. Russia is not perceived as a threat and China has only 60 satellites -- few of these are worth shooting down.

America's most robust ASAT weapons were not designed for destroying satellites at all -- they are missiles developed and operated by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), formerly known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. All U.S. ballistic missiles are actually dual-use, and while their ability to shoot down incoming rockets has been proven only in tests, it would be easy to direct them against any low Earth orbit satellite. Twenty-four MDA missiles are operational in Alaska and California, far more than would be needed, Pike says, to handle any immediate ASAT needs. There is, he says, ""just nothing to shoot at.""

For now, that is. The militarization of space has long been debated. With one blown-up old weather satellite, China has made the prospect of a new arms race far more likely. It showed the world that it is willing to go toe-to-toe up in the final frontier.

Waste Mismanagement IMPACT + ONE DAY It takes only 24 hours for debris to spread along the destroyed satellite's sun-synchronous polar orbit. The force of the impact drives debris into higher and lower orbits, but most of the wreckage remains at the satellite's original altitude.

JULY 2007 The debris ring broadens and begins to mix with satellites and the abundant trash in low Earth orbit, which extends to an altitude of about 1240 miles.

JANUARY 2008 A year after the test, the debris field continues to spread, joining the cloud of general space junk, which includes everything from 10-ton rocket boosters to radioactive droplets of sodium potassium coolant from the nuclear cores of Soviet satellites.

It's called the Kessler Syndrome -- the point at which low Earth orbit becomes so crowded with debris that collisions render space unusable. ""Debris accumulates over time and takes decades to decay,"" says Dr. T.S. Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. ""We can't track the smaller pieces, so there is even more out there than we know.""

Here's how the three busiest space players stack up.

United States: Topping the list, most U.S. space junk comes from the upper stages of sat launch vehicles.

Russia: The relatively low ratio of debris to satellites will soon change: The explosion of a Russian rocket over Australia in February appears to have produced approximately 1200 pieces of fresh debris.

China: Its January sat kill made it the top space polluter per satellite. ""Almost 85 percent of that debris will be in orbit in 100 years,"" says Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. ""It shows how badly they messed things up with one event."" -- E.M."	0

259	"The Bodybuilding community has long coveted the best performance-enhancing drug to boost muscle growth and improve energy levels. For starters, you have dbols, one of the most popular steroids today. It has also been said that this steroid can be found in muscle cells in as little as 6 hours after injection. Bodybuilders use this drug because it has an anabolic effect on muscle proteins. It speeds up protein synthesis and cures some minor health issues.

This muscle catalyst is also known to promote the growth of new muscle tissue. However, its effects can last up to two weeks, making it a popular choice among bodybuilders. This steroid has also been shown to improve nitrogen balance and enhance recovery from training. It also provides an increase in lean body mass as well as bone density. Here is the list of the best performance-enhancing drugs for bodybuilding:

Anabolic Drugs Or Steroids

Anabolic drugs or steroids are involved in building and maintaining muscles. The steroid substances that promote muscle tissue growth are, in fact, precursors to basic hormones. The pituitary gland produces anabolic hormones. It is controlled by a hormone gland located at the base of the brain.

These hormones control several functions such as; metabolism and protein synthesis. When you take this steroid, it will help you to gain muscle, strength, and stamina. This dbols supplement also plays an important role in building muscle and bones through stimulating protein.

Beta-2 Agonists

These synthetic drugs help expand the lungsÃ¢ÂÂ capacity, which means more oxygen is forced into your bloodstream. This, in turn, will increase metabolism rates and build lean muscles. These drugs are used during training sessions and events where a bodybuilder will be working out. The Beta-2 Agonists allow the body to burn more carbohydrates, and at the same time, they help you to use fat as energy. It also provides great energy that helps to reduce fatigue, stress, and anxiety.

Human Growth Hormone

Also referred to as HGH, this drug has increased lean muscles. Human Growth Hormone is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland responsible for growth during childhood. It remains active the whole life and can be stimulated by taking HGH. In addition, testosterone and other human growth hormone are factors that lead to building muscle. Athletes who take this drug have an increase in insulin which is also an indirect anabolic effect of HGH.

Ephedrine

Bodybuilders have used ephedrine for a long time. It has been around there for so long because of its ability to burn fat, boost metabolism, and enhance physical performance. Ephedrine is a popular drug for bodybuilders because it can be helpful while training and events to burn fat and increase muscles.

Methenolone

Methenolone is another popular steroid that is considered to be milder than most. Athletes use it for its potency in enhancing recovery time and prevention of injury. This steroid has also been used to increase muscle size and strength. It has the specialty of recovering the injury, whether external or internal. That is why athletes and sports people mostly consume it."	1

261	"Story highlights The Trump transition team says his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump promised to force Mexico to pay for the wall

Washington CNN Ã¢ÂÂ

President-elect Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials.

The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the wall.

Trump defended that proposal Friday morning in a tweet, saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed.

Ã¢ÂÂThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!Ã¢ÂÂ Trump tweeted Friday.

The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017

New York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday that American taxpayers would front the cost for the wall but that he was confident Trump could negotiate getting the money back from Mexico.

Ã¢ÂÂWhen you understand that MexicoÃ¢ÂÂs economy is dependent upon US consumers, Donald Trump has all the cards he needs to play,Ã¢ÂÂ Collins, congressional liaison for the Trump transition team, told CNNÃ¢ÂÂs Alisyn Camerota on Ã¢ÂÂNew Day.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂOn the trade negotiation side, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think itÃ¢ÂÂs that difficult for Donald Trump to convince Mexico that itÃ¢ÂÂs in their best interest to reimburse us for building the wall.Ã¢ÂÂ

The Trump team argues it will have the authority through a Bush-era 2006 law to build the wall, lawmakers say, but it lacks the money to do so. Transition officials have told House GOP leaders in private meetings theyÃ¢ÂÂd like to pay for the wall in the funding bill, a senior House GOP source said.

Ã¢ÂÂIt was not done in the Obama administration, so by funding the authorization thatÃ¢ÂÂs already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs campaign pledge to secure the border,Ã¢ÂÂ Indiana Republican Rep. Luke Messer said on Thursday.

Messer admitted itÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂbig dollars, but itÃ¢ÂÂs a question of priorities.Ã¢ÂÂ He pointed to a border security bill that Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul proposed last year that cost roughly $10 billion.

Ã¢ÂÂDemocrats may well find themselves in the position to shut down all of government to stop the buildout of a wall, or of a barrier, or of a fence,Ã¢ÂÂ Messer said.

Mexican leaders have repeatedly said they will not pay for the wall.

The Associated Press and Politico first reported elements of the talks earlier Thursday.

If Mexico refuses to pay for the wall, the GOP could add billions of dollars into the spending bill that needs to pass by April 28 to keep the government open. But doing so would force a showdown with Senate Democrats and potentially threaten a government shutdown.

No decisions have been made, GOP sources said.

Republicans point out that then-Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton voted for the 2006 bill and argued that since Democrats backed that bill, they should support efforts to fund the current effort.

The thinking behind the strategy is that it is harder for Democrats to filibuster spending bills because of the high stakes involved if they fail to pass in time.

Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House leadership, declined to say Thursday if Congress would pay for the wall.

Ã¢ÂÂWe want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the wall,Ã¢ÂÂ Scalise said. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre in talks with him on the details of it as theyÃ¢ÂÂre still putting together their team. We still got a few months before thereÃ¢ÂÂs another funding bill thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to move. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. We want to build a wall. He wants to build a wall.Ã¢ÂÂ

Could Mexico pay for the border wall?

Trump himself has estimated his border wall would cost $8 billion, though other analysts have estimated the price would be as much as $10 billion. And the proposals Trump has outlined to coerce Mexico into paying for the wall involve controversial measures that would still likely fail to cover the wallÃ¢ÂÂs full cost.

According to TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs website, those steps could include: remittance seizure, potential tariffs and foreign aids cuts, increasing fees on temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats, increasing fees on border crossing cards, increasing fees on NAFTA worker visas; and increasing fees at ports of entry to the US from Mexico.

A major challenge for judging TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs proposal is that most of those steps amount to a drop in the bucket Ã¢ÂÂ less than $1 billion Ã¢ÂÂ compared to the proposed cost of the wall. And the one step that could provide the required amount of money Ã¢ÂÂ remittance seizure Ã¢ÂÂ would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash.

Total US foreign aid to Mexico is less than $200 million a year ($186,000,000 in the 2014 fiscal year), so redirecting all of that money to a border wall would only put a mild dent in the $8 billion bill. And itÃ¢ÂÂs difficult to know the amount of revenue generated from a tariff on Mexican exports Ã¢ÂÂ or to account for potential losses from a retaliatory tariff Ã¢ÂÂ without the specifics of the tax.

Moving next to fee increases, Trump says on his website that Ã¢ÂÂeven a small increase in visa fees would pay for the wall. This includes fees on border crossing cards, of which more than 1 million are issued a year.Ã¢ÂÂ But the fees for visas and border crossing cards range from around $150 to $200 each, according to State Department data. Accounting for all the fees on over a million border crossing cards and visas in a year year Ã¢ÂÂ and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees Ã¢ÂÂ that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag.

The biggest potential source of money for the wall would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that immigrants, legal and illegal, earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country.

According to the bank of Mexico, Mexico received $24.8 billion in remittance payments in 2015. A Fox News Latino report calculated that 97% of remittance payments received by Mexico in the first three months of 2015 came from the US, and the Pew Research Center similarly reported that Ã¢ÂÂnearly allÃ¢ÂÂ of MexicoÃ¢ÂÂs remittance payment revenue comes from the U.S.Ã¢ÂÂ Seizing all of that money would probably be more than enough to pay for the border wall.

Trump says on his website that he would use the Patriot Act to require legal identification for money transfer transactions, according to his website. But CNN legal analyst Paul Callan says TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs plan would likely face multiple legal battles.

Ã¢ÂÂThe Mexican immigrants Trump seeks to target are clearly not the Ã¢ÂÂRadical Islamic TerroristsÃ¢ÂÂ that the Patriot Act was designed to fight,Ã¢ÂÂ says Callan. Ã¢ÂÂThe courts are likely to view Mr. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs use of the always controversial Patriot Act as an improper and illegal use. The proposal may also fail to place pressure on the Mexican government as money can be smuggled back to Mexico in many other creative ways if wire transfers are cut.Ã¢ÂÂ

The size of MexicoÃ¢ÂÂs remittance revenue far surpasses any other revenue-raising proposal from Trump, and would probably be the most effective way to pay for the border wall. But looking at the obstacles that such an action would face, itÃ¢ÂÂs difficult to envision a path to impounding those payments to pay for the wall."	0
262	"82-year-old William DeLisle of Marina Del Ray, California, has been sentenced to death for defending himself against a life-threatening situation. In October of 2015, DeLisle was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims.

The men, Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu, were already wanted for a crime spree that spanned nearly four years with dozens of victims. They preyed on older Americans, often grabbing them off the street to beat and rob them. Until they met DeLisle.

Now, Hallalla is in a wheelchair breathing through a tube and Salabu is dead. DeLisle, who stormed the beach at Normandy as a young man, responded to the young men like any good Marine would. He pulled a .22 from his ankle holster Ã¢ÂÂ which is Ã¢ÂÂillegalÃ¢ÂÂ in California Ã¢ÂÂ and put both men down in seconds.

Prosecutors said that because the two men were unarmed and using threats instead of actually hurting DeLisle meant that there was no imminent danger and that the use of deadly force was Ã¢ÂÂextreme and unnecessary.Ã¢ÂÂ The Dewey County Prosecutor explained in a press release:

Ã¢ÂÂMr. DeLisle could have handed over his wallet without incident. Instead, he chose to pull an illegally carried firearm from a concealed location and shot the two men. Had he stopped there it may not have been such a major incident, as both menÃ¢ÂÂs initial wounds were superficial.

While they were on the ground, DeLisle told Salabu that if he didnÃ¢ÂÂt Ã¢ÂÂdenounce his pagan moon god, Allah, that he would be meeting him. Salabu closed his eyes to pray and DeLisle put two bullets in his skull.

Hallalla, after seeing his friend murdered, tried to flee and was shot in the spine, paralizing him for life. This wasnÃ¢ÂÂt self-defense. It was murder and religious persecution.Ã¢ÂÂ

Religious persecution? How much you want to bet if the tables were turned and an elderly Muslim killed two Christian men trying to mug him heÃ¢ÂÂd get a medal from the Governor of California?

DeLisle has nothing to be concerned with, since the pansies in California donÃ¢ÂÂt actually execute prisoners. They have a moratorium on their useless death penalty and have for decades. He will, however, die in prison. His lawyer said DeLisle expressed that it was a Ã¢ÂÂsmall price to pay if he saved others from these two monsters.Ã¢ÂÂ

DeLisle hasnÃ¢ÂÂt asked for an appeal.

263	"China yesterday announced that Premier Wen Jiabao will attend the Copenhagen climate summit and that he will bring with him a target for China of reducing carbon intensity by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. Coming a day after the announcement across the Pacific that President Obama will attend the beginning of the summit, bringing a commitment to reduce U.S. emissions ""in the range of 17%"" from 2005 levels by 2020, this means that we now know what the world's two largest emitters will be bringing to the table when the world's countries gather in Copenhagen.

The official announcement (in Chinese here) notes that on November 25, Premier Wen Jiabao and the State Council standing committee met and decided upon the 2020 target and corresponding measures to achieve it. Of note are the following points:

1.) What exactly does the carbon intensity target cover? China will reduce its carbon intensity, the CO2 emitted per unit GDP, by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. This carbon intensity target will measure only the CO2 emissions from energy consumption and industrial activity, the source of most of China's emissions, and does not take into account efforts to reduce emissions or increase sinks from land use and forestry. This makes sense given that estimating emissions from land use and forestry is less precise than measuring emissions from fuel combustion and industrial activity, both of which are also more tightly linked to GDP than land use and forestry.

This makes sense given that estimating emissions from land use and forestry is less precise than measuring emissions from fuel combustion and industrial activity, both of which are also more tightly linked to GDP than land use and forestry. 2.) How will this be implemented? In order to measure the progress it is making in achieving this target, China will include the carbon intensity target in its medium and long-term social and economic development plans and develop corresponding statistics, monitoring and evaluation systems to measure progress. Thus, we can expect that the next five year plan (2010-2015) will include systems for monitoring and evaluating officials' and enterprises' performance in meeting the specific carbon intensity reduction targets allocated to them, similar to how the government implemented its target setting and official evaluation system for the twenty percent energy intensity reduction target in the current 11th Five Year Plan.

Will the target be binding internationally? At the moment, the carbon intensity target is only a voluntary action and is not intended to be binding internationally. However, the carbon intensity reduction targets will be mandatory (""Ã§ÂºÂ¦Ã¦ÂÂÃ¦ÂÂ§"") domestically for provinces and enterprises within China, similar to how the current energy intensity targets are mandatory, with consequences for officials of provinces and enterprises who do not meet their assigned targets.

At the moment, the carbon intensity target is only a voluntary action and is not intended to be binding internationally. However, the carbon intensity reduction targets will be mandatory (""Ã§ÂºÂ¦Ã¦ÂÂÃ¦ÂÂ§"") domestically for provinces and enterprises within China, similar to how the current energy intensity targets are mandatory, with consequences for officials of provinces and enterprises who do not meet their assigned targets. 4.) Is the 40 - 45% target significant? Although there is debate about how much of a reduction this 40 to 45 percent carbon intensity reduction target is from a ""business as usual"" scenario, we should keep in mind a few points. First, how we define ""business as usual"" matters. As part of its current 11th Five Year Plan, China took on a goal of reducing its energy intensity by 20% from 2006-10, which has led to a coordinated energy efficiency program that includes actions such as closing down smaller, inefficient power plants and outdated, inefficient iron and steel, cement and other manufacturing capacity, and improving the efficiency of the Top 1,000 energy consuming enterprises. If China succeeds in reducing its energy intensity by 20% by 2010, this would result in the avoidance of a billion tons of CO2 emissions. China should be given credit for these efforts and not penalized for taking early action.

Second, the International Energy Agency has noted that the commitments from China and the US are roughly in line with the actions they have estimated to be necessary to reach a concentration of 450 parts CO2 per million, what scientists have deemed is necessary to keep global temperatures from rising more than two degrees Celsius. While we would hope that both China and the U.S. will seek to raise the level of their ambition, both proposals are substantial and require real improvements in energy efficiency and low-carbon energy to achieve.

The other important thing to remember is the significance of the carbon intensity target for creating the proper framework and incentives for reducing emissions. As noted above, a carbon intensity target will require each province and major enterprise to measure, report and reduce their CO2 emissions and energy consumption, year-on-year, acting as a driver for greater efficiency and renewables. In this way, the carbon intensity target is similar to the US greenhouse gas mandatory reporting rule or the cap-and-trade system in the current climate legislation before Congress, which put in place the proper incentives and systems to transition to a low-carbon, clean energy economy. Provinces, local governments and enterprises will need to establish and improve systems for measuring and reporting emissions, and there will be increasing pressure on these enterprises and provinces to enact measures within their development plans for making continuous improvements in energy efficiency and renewable energy. At the national level, China will need to continue and accelerate its policies to boost energy efficiency and renewables, and it will need to build its capacity to measure and report emissions for its national greenhouse gas inventory on a yearly basis (something which EPA and China's National Development and Reform Commission have recently agreed to cooperate on).

Just as important as the targets they have set for themselves, China and the US must continue to accelerate their efforts to develop low carbon economies based on energy efficiency, renewables, and the development of clean technologies such as smart grids and electric vehicles. Both countries stand to benefit from the transition to a clean energy economy, by growing new clean industries and jobs, reducing their independence on dirty fossil fuels, and reducing their contribution to climate change and environmental damage. China can achieve a substantial reduction in its carbon intensity while continuing to grow its economy and providing an improved standard of living and a better environment for its citizens.

China's carbon intensity target is certainly a step in the right direction, and it provides the right incentives for future improvements in reducing emissions. Following the U.S.'s own emissions reduction announcement and the recent bilateral clean energy initiatives announced during President Obama's visit, we are beginning to see the outlines for a meaningful framework agreement in Copenhagen and a foundation for both countries to demonstrate leadership in addressing climate change."	0
264	"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.

The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole ""nay,"" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)

Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.

Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the ""black tar"" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from MexicoÃ¢ÂÂs border, we were skeptical.

Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement AdministrationÃ¢ÂÂs National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.

""Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,"" the report state. ""Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.""

The report also says that Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" (the DEAÃ¢ÂÂs term for drug-dealing gangs) ""pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.""

The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.

Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.

Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent.

SmugglersÃ¢ÂÂ creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.

Our ruling

Portman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been studying drug facts for nothing.

266	"The bombshell dropped on the Washington PostÃ¢ÂÂs website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs presidential campaign.

But not even John PodestaÃ¢ÂÂs private and largely inside-baseball notes to Clinton could save Trump the lashing that was coming his way.

Republicans lined up to criticize TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs language and attitudes toward women. His advisers worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day. Trump Tower was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisers urging him to make another apology and others just trying to make him see that there was a serious problem. And TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs Sunday nightÃ¢ÂÂs debate against the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records.

Trump initially issued a brief statement that claimed Bill Clinton had said far worse things as the pair played golf. RepublicansÃ¢ÂÂ freak-out did not slow, and he dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Trump tried the apology again. Ã¢ÂÂThese words donÃ¢ÂÂt reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump said in a straight-to-camera address that he released on social media. He likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign he is fighting against Clinton.

Then, against alliesÃ¢ÂÂ advice, he returned to Bill and Hillary ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs marriage. Ã¢ÂÂBill Clinton has actually abused women. And Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump said.

It wasnÃ¢ÂÂt exactly the advice many of his supporters were seeking. Ã¢ÂÂDonald Trump needs to humble himself,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump adviser Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Trump tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in his penthouse. Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States say some of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. Ã¢ÂÂThere have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth,Ã¢ÂÂ Republican strategist and Trump critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: Ã¢ÂÂHow does any woman work for Donald Trump?Ã¢ÂÂ

It made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs election. In the midst of all this, the State DepartmentÃ¢ÂÂs release of more of ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs own emails from her time as the nationÃ¢ÂÂs top diplomat were largely an afterthought, as were TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs continued incorrect claims about the Central Park Five.

As TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs candidacy appearedÃ¢ÂÂyet againÃ¢ÂÂto teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up PodestaÃ¢ÂÂs Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Trump fiasco. Trump made a feeble attempt at apologizing while his son tried to distract attention to ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs emails, which he called an Ã¢ÂÂOctober SurpriseÃ¢ÂÂ on Twitter. All eyes stayed on TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs words, however. Ã¢ÂÂWomen have the power to stop Trump,Ã¢ÂÂ Clinton tweeted and posted a video of his worst statements about women.

In an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct eventsÃ¢ÂÂand the responsesÃ¢ÂÂwould affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Trump, his standing with female voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes him bragging about getting away with groping women because he is a celebrity. Hearing him say Ã¢ÂÂWhen youÃ¢ÂÂre a star, they let you do itÃ¢ÂÂ hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan.

Ã¢ÂÂHe is talking about sexual assault. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no other way to frame this,Ã¢ÂÂ Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor.

For Clinton, her top aideÃ¢ÂÂs emails offered an embarrassing window into both her political calculations in private and highlights from paid speechesÃ¢ÂÂa sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs one-time rival Bernie Sanders that she couldnÃ¢ÂÂt be trusted. In one email, sent just before IowaÃ¢ÂÂs lead-off caucuses this year, the top communications aides were brought up to speed on what Clinton had said behind closed doors. The worst possible headlines? Ã¢ÂÂClinton admits she is out of touch,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂClinton suggests she is a moderateÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂClinton says you need to have a private and public position on policy.Ã¢ÂÂ

Another potential pickle is this headline: Ã¢ÂÂClinton is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries.Ã¢ÂÂ Republicans are obsessed with ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs use of a private email server as Secretary of State, and anything involving email is likely to overshadow any of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs woes in the echo chamber of conservative Twitter.

Yet, as a whole, TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Trump himself would later call Ã¢ÂÂlocker-room banterÃ¢ÂÂ laughing about trying to bed a married woman, describing womenÃ¢ÂÂs appearance in crass terms and popping breath mints in case he could woo an actress, just months after his own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Republicans were not rushing to provide one.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has tried to guide Trump to more respectable ground, released a statement: Ã¢ÂÂNo woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.Ã¢ÂÂ The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeted that Ã¢ÂÂsuch vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs face to the world.Ã¢ÂÂ Sen. Mark Kirk or Illinois called Trump Ã¢ÂÂa malignant clown.Ã¢ÂÂ Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the remarksÃ¢ÂÂtotally inappropriate and offensive.Ã¢ÂÂ Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said Ã¢ÂÂAmerica deserves far betterÃ¢ÂÂ than Trump. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs vanquished rival for the GOP nomination Jeb Bush said Ã¢ÂÂno apology can excuse away Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs reprehensible comments degrading women.Ã¢ÂÂ

Trump loyalists merely said Clinton was behind the release of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs video. Ã¢ÂÂThey did their opposition research. This is what they had,Ã¢ÂÂ former Rep. Michele Bachmann told MSNBC. Ã¢ÂÂShe has to change the narrative.Ã¢ÂÂ Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Bachmann said she had no evidence to back up her claim. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed told CNN that abortion and the economy would keep TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs supporters firmly in their camp. Ã¢ÂÂA 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

That thinking might help some of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs backers to justify their continued support. After all, Hillary Clinton is hardly a beloved figure after decades in public life, and antipathy runs deep in conservative circles. The release of her campaign chairmanÃ¢ÂÂs stolen emails will give her critics yet more fodder.

But thereÃ¢ÂÂs a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate himself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday nightÃ¢ÂÂs competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October.

267	"THE NATIONÃ¢ÂÂS FISCAL OUTLOOK

The PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs 2008 Budget addresses the NationÃ¢ÂÂs near-term and long-term fiscal challenges through pro-growth economic policies and spending restraint. Three years ago, the President set a goal to cut the deficit in half by 2009 from its projected peak in 2004. The PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs fiscal approach succeeded, and the resultsÃ¢ÂÂincluding two consecutive years of double-digit revenue growthÃ¢ÂÂallowed the President to achieve that goal in 2006, three years ahead of schedule. The AdministrationÃ¢ÂÂs fiscal strategy of pro-growth tax policy, restraint in discretionary spending, and reductions in the growth of entitlement spending, will further reduce the deficit and balance the budget by 2012. This steady improvement in the deficit outlook is welcome news. Yet despite this improvement in the near term, the Nation continues to face pressing long-term fiscal challenges arising from our key entitlement programs. The President has made clear that he wants to work with the Congress to address this longer-term problem of the unsustainable growth in entitlement spending.

THE NEAR-TERM FISCAL OUTLOOK

Since the beginning of his Administration, the President has pursued pro-growth economic policies to give all Americans the opportunity to share in the NationÃ¢ÂÂs prosperity. Strong economic growth is also essential to generating the revenue needed to reduce the deficit. The President has pursued spending restraint in the face of enormous challenges, from the significant costs arising from the September 11th terrorist attacks and the subsequent War on Terror, to the response and rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina.

The size of the deficit and the debt is best assessed in relation to the economy as a whole, as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In his 2005 Budget, the President set a goal to cut the deficit in half by 2009 from its projected peak in 2004. The President achieved his goal in 2006, three years ahead of schedule. The deficit fell from a projected 4.5 percent of GDP, or $521 billion, to 1.9 percent of GDP, or $248 billion. This deficit is below the 40-year historical average of 2.4 percent of GDP, and is smaller than the deficit as a percent of GDP in 18 of the previous 25 years.

The Budget reflects the projected full costs of the War on Terror for 2007 and 2008. It also includes an allowance for at least a portion of the anticipated costs for 2009; actual funding needs will be determined by conditions at that time. In addition, the Budget assumes the extension for one year of relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Even with these added costs, the deficit is projected to decline in both dollar terms and as a share of the economy in 2007. By 2012, the Budget is projected to generate a surplus of $61 billion. The Budget projects these results while increasing funding for the NationÃ¢ÂÂs security, investing in education and supporting other key national priorities, including making permanent the President's tax relief.

The NationÃ¢ÂÂs fiscal outlook is reflected in both the annual budget deficit and the amount of Federal debt held by the public, which is debt issued to finance past and current deficit spending. Debt held by the public has ranged from 33 to 49 percent of GDP over the past 20 years, and has averaged 35 percent over the past 40 years. For 2006, debt held by the public declined from 37.4 percent to 37.0 percent of GDP. For 2012, debt held by the public is expected to be 32 percent, below the 40-year historical average, providing further evidence that the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs pro-growth economic policies and spending restraint are working to improve the NationÃ¢ÂÂs fiscal outlook.

Strong Economy: Fueled by Pro-Growth Policies

The PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs pro-growth economic policies, beginning with his tax relief proposals, have promoted America's entrepreneurial spirit, rewarding the hard work and risk-taking of the NationÃ¢ÂÂs workers and entrepreneurs. The tax relief included reducing marginal individual income tax rates, doubling the child tax credit, reducing the marriage penalty, reducing capital gains and dividend tax rates, encouraging retirement savings, reducing the estate and gift tax, and increasing incentives for small business investment. On May 17, 2006, the President signed the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, extending through 2010 capital gains and dividend tax rate relief and extending through 2009 a provision to encourage small business investment by raising the expensing limits for equipment purchases. On August 17, 2006, the President signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006, tightening the rules relating to defined-benefit plans and making permanent some of the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs proposals to encourage retirement and education savings.

Note: Shaded areas indicate recessions.

Because of the positive economic impact his tax relief program has had in the short term, and would continue to have over the long term, the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs policy is to make tax relief permanent rather than allowing it to expire as scheduled at the end of this decade. Since the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs tax relief was fully implemented in 2003, the NationÃ¢ÂÂs economy has generated more than seven million jobs. This strong economic growth has been good for the NationÃ¢ÂÂs workers and the resulting revenue growth has been good for the Federal budget.

For 2006, tax receipts of $2.4 trillion were 11.8 percent greater than in 2005, and in 2005 receipts were 14.5 percent higher than in 2004. Each year constituted record receipts and together made for the highest two-year percentage growth in receipts in the past 25 years. The Budget conservatively projects future revenue growth that averages 5.4 percent over the next six years, about equal to the projected overall growth in the economy.

The tax proposals in the 2008 Budget promote continued economic growth and, consequently, continued growth in the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs tax receipts. The Budget proposes to make permanent tax relief that was enacted in 2001 and 2003. In addition, the Administration proposes to change the tax code to encourage savings for retirement, to make it easier for all Americans to afford health insurance, and to increase small business investment. Furthermore, the Administration proposes to simplify the tax code for families, close tax loopholes, and increase tax compliance.

In addition to tax relief, the President will continue to strengthen the economy by advancing basic research and development, promoting innovation and accountability in education, reducing the burden on business of Government paperwork and regulations, reducing costly and unnecessary litigation, and eliminating trade barriers and opening overseas markets to American products and services.

National Security Spending: Protecting the American People

Security spending includes spending for the Department of Defense, homeland security, and international diplomatic efforts. International affairs spending finances efforts to create a stable government in Iraq, rebuild the economy in Afghanistan, and enhance security by promoting democracy and building alliances around the world. Between 2001 and 2006, security spending increased 41 percent overall: 36 percent for defense, 38 percent for international affairs, and 209 percent for homeland security. These significant increases were necessary to protect the NationÃ¢ÂÂs homeland and pursue the War on Terror after September 11th.

In his 2008 Budget, the President includes a further 10.5 percent increase in base defense spending. This includes funding to maintain a high level of military readiness to support the Global War on Terror and to continue to transform the military to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. The Budget includes a 17.1-percent increase in spending for international affairs to support key allies in the Global War on Terror, promote democratic institutions and values, counter the spread of HIV/AIDS, and provide humanitarian assistance to those affected by continuing violence and instability. In addition, the Budget includes a 6.7-percent increase to defend the NationÃ¢ÂÂs homeland by funding nuclear detection capabilities, strengthening the countryÃ¢ÂÂs borders, developing high-tech screening capabilities, and maintaining close partnerships with State and local law enforcement officials.

Spending Restraint: Slowing Growth in Non-Security and Entitlement Spending

The near-term budget outlook has improved in large part because of the double-digit growth in tax receipts and also because of spending restraint. Due to the need for increased spending on defense and homeland security as part of the Global War on Terror and the automatic increases in spending for entitlement programs, outlays rose to $2.7 trillion in 2006, or 20.3 percent of GDP. Despite these spending pressures, spending remained below the 40-year historical average of 20.6 percent of GDP. This is largely because over the past two years, the Congress and the President have reduced the growth rate in non-security discretionary spendingÃ¢ÂÂwhich grew by more than 16 percent in the last year of the previous AdministrationÃ¢ÂÂto below the rate of inflation. In addition, in February 2006, the Congress enacted and the President signed into law the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, generating nearly $40 billion in mandatory savings over five years.

The 2008 Budget achieves spending restraint by holding growth in non-security discretionary spending to one percent in 2008 and for the five-year period. The Budget reduces or eliminates 141 programs saving $12.0 billion, and slows spending growth through sensible reforms in entitlement and other mandatory programs, resulting in savings of $96 billion over five years, and growing to savings of $309 billion over 10 years. This total includes $66 billion in savings in Medicare and $6.8 billion in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) over five years, as discussed below. The Budget also proposes to increase premiums paid to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) by corporations with defined-benefit pension plans, providing $5.5 billion over five years to put the PBGC on a path to solvency. And, the Budget proposes to increase user fees, saving $7 billion over five years, to capture more fully the costs to the Government of providing particular goods and services.

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK

While the near-term outlook of smaller deficits and a surplus starting in 2012 is encouraging, the current structure of the Federal GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs major entitlement programs will place a growing and unsustainable burden on the budget in the long-term. Currently, spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security is approximately eight percent of the NationÃ¢ÂÂs GDP. With the first of the baby boom generation becoming eligible for Social Security in 2008, Social Security spending will accelerate. Three years later, the problem will become more pronounced as these individuals become eligible for Medicare, under which program costs rise even faster due to health care inflation. By 2050, spending on these three entitlement programs is projected to be more than 15 percent of GDP, or more than twice as large as spending on all other programs combined, excluding interest on the public debt.

The mandatory savings proposals in the 2008 Budget will not solve the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs long-term fiscal challenges, but they are an important and meaningful step, producing a significant improvement over the long term. Under the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs Budget policies, the deficit in 2050 is projected to be 4.7 percent of GDP. In contrast, if the Congress fails to adopt the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs mandatory proposals and permits current law to remain in force, the deficit in 2050 is projected to be 7.5 percent of GDP. A more detailed analysis of the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs long-term fiscal outlook is provided in the Stewardship chapter of the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget.

Social Security: Promised Benefits Outpacing Resources

Social Security was designed as a pay-as-you-go, self-financing program whereby current workers pay taxes directly and indirectly, through their employers, to support the benefit payments for current retirees, disabled persons, and survivors (collectively, beneficiaries). Such a system can only be sustained if the number of workers and the taxes they pay align with the number of beneficiaries and the benefits they receive. In 1950, when there were 16 workers for every program beneficiary, the combined payroll tax rate was very low at 3 percent of taxable wages. Currently, there are 3.3 workers for every beneficiary and the tax rate is 12.4 percent. The ratio of workers to beneficiaries is expected to decline further as the first of the baby boom generation becomes eligible for Social Security in 2008, and will fall to 2.2 workers per beneficiary in 2030.

Even after the baby boom generation is fully retired, the ratio of workers to beneficiaries will continue to fall, reaching 1.9 in 2080 primarily because of the growing difference between projected life expectancy and the age at which seniors become eligible for Social Security benefits. The increase in longevity, coupled with the fact that Americans are spending fewer years in the workforce, means that Americans are spending a greater proportion of their lives in retirement than ever before. Since 1940, life expectancy at age 65 has increased by approximately 40 percent and is projected to increase by an additional 20 percent by 2080.

The growth in retirees resulting from the retirement of the baby boom generation and increases in life expectancy will create a large and rapidly growing mismatch between scheduled Social Security benefits and the resources available to the program under current law. Through 2016, Social Security is projected to collect more in cash receipts than it pays in benefits. Beginning in 2017, however, Social Security benefit payments are projected to exceed the cash income dedicated to the trust funds. From this point forward, the Federal Government must borrow, tax, or cut other spending to pay excess Social Security benefits. Receipts are projected to continue falling to 70 percent of promised benefits by 2080.

There are many ways to summarize the extent of the mismatch between expected Social Security receipts and benefits. One such summary is the discounted present value of all future scheduled benefits net of receipts, or unfunded obligations under Social Security. The concept is to compare scheduled benefits and receipts under current law into the indefinite future, and to recognize through discounting that a dollar tomorrow is worth less than a dollar today. Based on the 2006 Social Security TrusteesÃ¢ÂÂ Report, the unfunded obligation of Social Security totals $15.3 trillion over the indefinite future. To put this figure into perspective, this is about three times the amount of Federal debt currently held by the public.

The President is committed to strengthening Social Security through a bipartisan reform process in which participants are encouraged to bring different options for strengthening Social Security to the table. The President has identified three goals for reform: to strengthen permanently the safety net for future generations without raising payroll tax rates; to protect those who depend on Social Security the most; and to offer every American a chance to experience ownership through voluntary personal retirement accounts.

The 2008 Budget again reflects the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs proposal to allow workers to use a portion of the Social Security payroll tax to fund voluntary personal retirement accounts. These accounts will permit Americans to have greater control over their retirement planning, giving them an opportunity to obtain a higher return on their payroll taxes than is possible in the current Social Security system. The result will be to shift Social Security from an entirely pay-as-you-go system of financing toward a system that is less dependent on current workers. Beginning in 2012, workers will be allowed to use up to four percent of their Social Security taxable earnings, up to a $1,300 annual limit, to fund their personal retirement accounts; the $1,300 cap will be increased by $100 each year through 2017.

As one component of reforms to make the system sustainable, the President has embraced the idea of indexing future benefits of the highest-wage workers to inflation while continuing to index the wages of lower-wage workers to wage growth. Over time, wages tend to rise faster than prices, and so Ã¢ÂÂprogressive indexingÃ¢ÂÂ provides a higher rate of indexing for lower-wage workers than for higher-wage workers. This proposal would help restore the solvency of Social Security, while protecting those who most depend on Social Security. Comprehensive Social Security reform including personal retirement accounts, changes in the indexation of wages, and other modest changes will ensure the sustainability of the program for future generations, and help slow the unsustainable growth in total entitlement spending.

Health Care: Reforms to Improve Quality and Reduce Cost

The Nation spends more than $2 trillion per year on health care, permitting Americans to live longer and healthier lives than at any time in the NationÃ¢ÂÂs history. The Federal Government is the NationÃ¢ÂÂs largest purchaser of health care, accounting for approximately one-third of U.S. health care spending. As a result, economic developments in the health care sector, including the high rate of growth in health care inflation that confronts individuals and companies, are becoming acute fiscal problems for individuals and businesses, and for the Federal Government. Despite an enormous investment and enormous gains in the quality of care overall, health care inflation, the extent of private health care insurance coverage, and gaps in the availability of high-quality care are problems the Nation continues to face.

The 2008 Budget proposes a number of reforms to improve the NationÃ¢ÂÂs health care system. The Administration is proposing a significant change in the tax treatment of health insurance purchases and expenditures for out-of-pocket health care costs. Under this proposal, all individuals and families who buy at least a catastrophic health plan will receive the same tax benefits, in the form of a flat $15,000 deduction. The AdministrationÃ¢ÂÂs proposal will make health insurance more affordable for millions of American families and reduce the number of the uninsured. This policy will also eliminate the tax bias toward high-cost insurance, making health care purchasers more price conscious and thereby marshalling market forces more effectively to restrain health care inflation. The Administration continues to promote the use of health information technology to enhance the health care delivery system, including the availability of price and quality information to individuals. This would allow health care consumers to spend their health care dollars more wisely, and avoid unnecessary procedures and treatments.

The President has also asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with the Congress and the States on an Affordable Choices Initiative to redirect existing resources in the health care system to help poor and hard-to-insure citizens afford private insurance. This initiative would help avoid costly and unnecessary emergency room visits and improve health care quality and efficiency.

Medicare: Slowing Cost Growth through Reforms

The single largest fiscal challenge we face is the unsustainable growth in the Medicare program. The Medicare Part A Hospital Insurance program receives designated payroll taxes from employees and their employers, which are deposited in the Medicare trust fund held by the Government. Medicare Part A is therefore similar to Social Security in that it is an inter-generational transfer program with current workers paying benefits for current beneficiaries. In contrast, under Medicare Part B, the Supplementary Medical Insurance program, and Part D, the new drug benefit, beneficiaries pay premiums to cover some of the costs and the balance is paid out of general revenues.

As in the case of Social Security, Medicare will face increased cost pressures over the next several decades as the baby boom generation becomes eligible for and receives Medicare benefits. But because of rising health care costs, Medicare is projected to have much higher cost-per-beneficiary growth than Social Security in the coming decades.

MedicareÃ¢ÂÂs dedicated revenues from designated payroll taxes and from premium payments cover only 57 percent of current benefits. The remaining 43 percent is financed from general tax revenues. By 2030, the pressure from Medicare on general revenues will be substantially greater as dedicated revenues are projected to finance only 38 percent of total benefits, leaving 62 percent of program costs relying on general tax revenues. This projected rate of growth in Medicare benefits is not sustainable over time.

The 2006 Medicare TrusteesÃ¢ÂÂ report shows that future dedicated payroll taxes and premiums are sufficient to cover only a portion of MedicareÃ¢ÂÂs projected costs. This results in an unfunded obligation (the gap between dedicated receipts and projected costs) of $71 trillion over the infinite horizon. This is more than four times as large as the gap between receipts and projected costs for Social Security and 14 times as large the total amount of Government debt that is held by the public. Within Medicare, the Hospital Insurance trust fund, which is mostly funded by the Medicare payroll tax, has unfunded obligations, or a gap between dedicated receipts and projected costs, of $28 trillion. Meeting these obligations would require tripling the Medicare payroll tax. If the Medicare payroll tax were used to pay for MedicareÃ¢ÂÂs entire $71 trillion unfunded obligation, the Medicare payroll tax would have to be increased by 500 percent. This would be a huge tax increase on workers and companies that would cripple the NationÃ¢ÂÂs economy. The only realistic solution is to reduce program growth to a sustainable level.

In the long run, part of the solution to Medicare and MedicaidÃ¢ÂÂs unsustainable growth must lie with slowing health care inflation. Recent trends in the overall health care market have already improved MedicareÃ¢ÂÂs finances. Spending on the Medicare drug program has been lower than originally expected because of lower-than-projected growth in prescription drug inflation. Medicare drug program spending in 2006, the first year of the benefit, was $15 billion lower than initially estimated. In addition, the drug program spending for 2007 is projected to be $25 billion lower than initially estimated, and for 2007 through 2016 the spending is projected to be $189 billion lower. The slower growth in prescription drug prices has been good for beneficiaries as well. Beneficiary premiums for the drug benefit are lower than expected: an average of $22 per month in 2007 rather than $39 per month as initially estimated. Controlling health care inflation is critical to the success of reform, but other significant reforms are also needed.

With an unfunded obligation of $71 trillion, and annual increases in spending well above inflation and other domestic spending, there has been increasing focus on the need to address Medicare growth rates. The 2008 Budget proposes to restrain Medicare spending both in the near term and in the long term. These proposals save $66 billion over five years and reduce the present value of future net costs by an estimated $8 trillion over 75 years. These are sensible reforms, most of which have been proposed in previous budgets. The aggregate impact of the proposed reforms only slows the rate of growth of the Medicare program from 7.4 percent over 10 years to 6.7 percent.

To achieve these savings, the Budget proposes to promote high-quality and cost-efficient care through competition and innovation. Specifically, the Budget proposes to adjust permanently provider payments to encourage efficiency and productivity, taking advantage of advances in medical technology and the delivery of care, and other management improvements. The Budget also proposes to establish competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services.

The Budget also proposes to encourage greater responsibility for health care use and costs for high-income beneficiaries. In addition, the Budget proposes to modernize and rationalize Medicare policies to encourage efficient and cost-effective payments. For example, the Budget proposes to ensure that patients are served in the most medically appropriate and cost-efficient setting for post-acute care, and that payments for medical equipment be brought in line with actual costs.

In addition to proposing specific reforms to reduce the unsustainable rate of growth in the near term, the Budget also proposes a new mechanism to address the long-term funded unfunded obligation in Medicare. The Budget proposes to build on the progress made in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) with respect to Medicare financing. Under current law, MMA requires the Medicare Trustees issue a Ã¢ÂÂfunding warningÃ¢ÂÂ if, for two consecutive years, the Trustees find that more than 45 percent of projected Medicare expenditures will require funding from general tax revenue (rather than dedicated resources) within the next six years. In the 2006 TrusteesÃ¢ÂÂ Report, the Trustees found that general revenue funding would first reach the 45 percent level in 2012, within the seven-year window specified in the MMA.

The 2008 Budget proposes to add an incentive for reform to the MMA funding warning. Specifically, in the year in which the 45 percent threshold is exceeded, there would be automatic payment reductions to providers by four-tenths of one percent per year. The provider payments would continue to be reduced by an additional four-tenths of one percent per year, as long as MedicareÃ¢ÂÂs receipts cover 55 percent or less of program costs. The provision is intended to encourage the Congress and the Administration to reach agreement on reforms needed to slow the growth in program costs.

Medicaid: Proposals Ensure Fiscal Integrity

Medicaid is the Federal entitlement program that provides medical assistance, including acute and long-term care, to low-income families with dependent children and to low-income individuals who are elderly, blind, or disabled. As with Medicare, Medicaid costs will increase substantially in the coming decades as the baby boomers retire and begin to have greater health care needs. An increasing number of low-income elderly individuals will come to rely on Medicaid for non-hospital care, including long-term care. In addition, as with Medicare, Medicaid will be under increasing fiscal pressure in the coming decades as a result of health care inflation.

The PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs Budget proposes a package of program integrity reforms. These reforms save approximately $6.8 billion over five years, including additional increased funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The Budget builds on previous initiatives, some of which were included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, to promote sound financial practices, increase market efficiencies, and eliminate Medicaid overpayments. The proposals included in the 2008 Budget help to ensure the fiscal integrity of Medicaid by lowering its rate of growth. These proposed changes reduce the rate of growth of Medicaid from 7.7 percent to 7.6 percent over the next 10 years.

BUDGET REFORMS

During the 1990s, budget decisions were governed by the now-expired Budget Enforcement Act (BEA). Under the BEA, discretionary spending (including both budget authority and actual outlays) was limited each fiscal year to a maximum amount specified in law. In addition, under the BEA, pay-as-you-go rules required all legislation involving new mandatory spending or tax cuts was required to be deficit neutral. Violations of the discretionary spending caps or the pay-as-you-go provisions triggered across-the-board spending reductions. The BEA generally succeeded in preventing the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs budgetary outlook from deteriorating.

Based in part on the spending controls in the BEA, the President has proposed a number of budget process reforms, including new caps on discretionary spending, a pay-as-you-go requirement for mandatory spending, a line-item veto, and earmark reform. In addition, the Administration implemented its own pay-as-you-go controls to limit mandatory spending resulting from agency administrative action. Specifically, on May 23, 2005, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) began requiring that proposed agency administrative action that increases mandatory spending be offset by administrative actions that reduce mandatory spending by the same amount.

Federal spending is generally divided into three major categories: discretionary spending (approximately 38 percent of the Budget), mandatory spending (53 percent), and interest on the debt (9 percent).

Discretionary Spending Caps: Restraining Annual Appropriations

Discretionary spending is generally thought of as funding the day-to-day operations of Government and is the only spending subject to annual review and appropriations by the Congress and the President. As distinct from mandatory spending, discretionary spending must be enacted into law every year before Government agencies may obligate and spend money. Hence, discretionary spending is not subject to the same automatic, uncontrolled growth characteristic of some mandatory spending. Nevertheless, without active restraint reinforced by effective rules governing the legislative process, discretionary spending will tend to increase steadily over time. The 2008 Budget proposes to reinstate BEA controls on discretionary spending. Specifically, the Budget proposes placing statutory limits or Ã¢ÂÂcapsÃ¢ÂÂ on discretionary spending each year through 2012. Any appropriations bill that causes the caps to be exceeded would be subject to a point of order, requiring a three-fifths vote, in the Senate. If, in the aggregate, appropriations actions exceed the spending caps, then OMB would be required to make across-the-board cuts to reduce total discretionary spending to the statutory caps.

Within these proposed spending caps, the Budget proposes to devote resources for program integrity efforts. Program integrity efforts are designed to eliminate spending to those not eligible for benefit payments and to collect unpaid taxes due to the Government. Since program integrity efforts can generate as high as a ten-to-one return to the Government, the Administration proposes an adjustment to the statutory discretionary spending limits for amounts dedicated to program integrity.

Mandatory Spending Controls: Restraining Automatic Spending

The vast majority of spending for mandatory programs takes place automatically every year without any action on the part of the Congress or the President. It is made up of Ã¢ÂÂentitlementÃ¢ÂÂ programs, for which the amount of spending is based on the number of qualifying beneficiaries and benefit formulas specified in law. This spending provides income security and health care to individuals who are elderly, disabled, widowed, or orphaned. These programs are effectively exempt from the annual review and approval in the budget process because the benefit qualifications and benefit formulas are specified in law, resulting in an automatic appropriation of benefit payments.

In 1962, mandatory spending accounted for just over one-quarter of total Government outlays and discretionary spending accounted for slightly more than two-thirds of Government outlays; the remainder of outlays was for interest. Today, the picture is dramatically different, with mandatory spending having doubled as a share of total outlays, now accounting for 53 percent of all Government spending. Without intervention, entitlement spending over the next four decades will become unsustainable. With the baby boom population beginning to become eligible for Social Security in 2008 and Medicare in 2011, the time to address this problem is now.

The 2008 Budget proposes to place limits on new mandatory spending. In addition to the proposal to address excessive general revenue spending in Medicare, discussed above, the Budg"	0

The following is a transcript of Wednesday nightÃ¢ÂÂs presidential debate in Denver.

21:01:40: JIM LEHRER: Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. IÃ¢ÂÂm Jim Lehrer of the Ã¢ÂÂPBS NewsHour,Ã¢ÂÂ and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 presidential debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.

This debate and the next three Ã¢ÂÂ two presidential, one vice presidential Ã¢ÂÂ are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. TonightÃ¢ÂÂs 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment.

Thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates.

The segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements.

The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent Ã¢ÂÂ no cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney.

(APPLAUSE)

Gentlemen, welcome to you both. LetÃ¢ÂÂs start the economy, segment one, and letÃ¢ÂÂs begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?

You have two minutes. Each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.

21:04:24: PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.

There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.

And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.

(LAUGHTER)

You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up.

And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, weÃ¢ÂÂve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise.

But we all know that weÃ¢ÂÂve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where weÃ¢ÂÂve been, but where weÃ¢ÂÂre going.

Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that weÃ¢ÂÂll be better off. IÃ¢ÂÂve got a different view.

I think weÃ¢ÂÂve got to invest in education and training. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that weÃ¢ÂÂre helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that weÃ¢ÂÂre saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.

Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters Ã¢ÂÂ to you Ã¢ÂÂ which path we should take. Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And IÃ¢ÂÂm looking forward to having that debate.

21: 06:31: LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.

21:06:32: FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. ItÃ¢ÂÂs an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president. IÃ¢ÂÂm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.

And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. IÃ¢ÂÂm sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here Ã¢ÂÂ here with me. So IÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(LAUGHTER)

Congratulations.

This is obviously a very tender topic. IÃ¢ÂÂve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve been out of work since May. Can you help me?Ã¢ÂÂ

Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, Ã¢ÂÂAnn, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. HeÃ¢ÂÂs lost his most recent job and weÃ¢ÂÂve now just lost our home. Can you help us?Ã¢ÂÂ

And the answer is, yes, we can help, but itÃ¢ÂÂs going to take a different path. Not the one weÃ¢ÂÂve been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not what IÃ¢ÂÂm going to do.

My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs.

Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.

Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. WeÃ¢ÂÂre far away from that now.

Number four, get to us a balanced budget.

Number five, champion small business. ItÃ¢ÂÂs small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.

Now, IÃ¢ÂÂm concerned that the path that weÃ¢ÂÂre on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more Ã¢ÂÂ if you will, trickle-down government Ã¢ÂÂ would work.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not the right answer for America. IÃ¢ÂÂll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.

21:08:40: LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down Ã¢ÂÂ his trick-down approach, as he said yours is.

21:08:50: OBAMA: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, weÃ¢ÂÂve got to improve our education system and weÃ¢ÂÂve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.

So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.

When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.

On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that weÃ¢ÂÂve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than theyÃ¢ÂÂve been in years. But I also believe that weÃ¢ÂÂve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.

So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things IÃ¢ÂÂm sure weÃ¢ÂÂll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?

And this is where thereÃ¢ÂÂs a difference, because Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut Ã¢ÂÂ on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs another trillion dollars Ã¢ÂÂ and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasnÃ¢ÂÂt asked for. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.

21:11:03: LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can.

But, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that youÃ¢ÂÂd like to ask the president directly about something he just said?

21:11:03: ROMNEY: Well, sure. IÃ¢ÂÂd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.

First of all, I donÃ¢ÂÂt have a $5 trillion tax cut. I donÃ¢ÂÂt have a tax cut of a scale that youÃ¢ÂÂre talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. TheyÃ¢ÂÂll do fine whether youÃ¢ÂÂre president or I am.

The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a Ã¢ÂÂ this is a tax in and of itself. IÃ¢ÂÂll call it the economy tax. ItÃ¢ÂÂs been crushing.

At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed.

And so the question is how to get them going again. And IÃ¢ÂÂve described it. ItÃ¢ÂÂs energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the Ã¢ÂÂ the cornerstones of my plan.

But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas IÃ¢ÂÂll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, weÃ¢ÂÂve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.

The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.

The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies.

Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If IÃ¢ÂÂm president, IÃ¢ÂÂll double them, and also get the Ã¢ÂÂ the oil from offshore and Alaska. And IÃ¢ÂÂll bring that pipeline in from Canada.

And, by the way, I like coal. IÃ¢ÂÂm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like itÃ¢ÂÂs getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.

And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, IÃ¢ÂÂm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the Ã¢ÂÂ the revenues going to the government. My Ã¢ÂÂ my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.

But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I Ã¢ÂÂ and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any Ã¢ÂÂ any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?

21:14:22: OBAMA: Well, I think Ã¢ÂÂ letÃ¢ÂÂs talk about taxes, because I think itÃ¢ÂÂs instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.

And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid whoÃ¢ÂÂs going off to college, which means theyÃ¢ÂÂre spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.

Now, Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that heÃ¢ÂÂs been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been able to identify them.

But IÃ¢ÂÂm going to make an important point here, Jim.

21:16:34: LEHRER: All right.

21:16:36: OBAMA: When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can Ã¢ÂÂ are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you donÃ¢ÂÂt come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.

OBAMA: And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs pledge of not reducing the deficit or Ã¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂ or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families. The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.

Now, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not my analysis. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And Ã¢ÂÂ and that kind of top Ã¢ÂÂ top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.

21:16:37: LEHRER: All right. What is the difference? LetÃ¢ÂÂs just stay on taxes.

(CROSSTALK)

LEHRER: Just Ã¢ÂÂ letÃ¢ÂÂs just stay on taxes for (inaudible).

(CROSSTALK)

LEHRER: What is the differenceÃ¢ÂÂ¦

21:16:42: ROMNEY: Well, but Ã¢ÂÂ but virtually Ã¢ÂÂ virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.

21:16:43: LEHRER: All right.

21:16:44: ROMNEY: So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, IÃ¢ÂÂd say absolutely not. IÃ¢ÂÂm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What IÃ¢ÂÂve said is I wonÃ¢ÂÂt put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs part one. So thereÃ¢ÂÂs no economist that can say Mitt RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.

Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know itÃ¢ÂÂs a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but itÃ¢ÂÂs just not the case. Look, IÃ¢ÂÂve got five boys. IÃ¢ÂÂm used to people saying something thatÃ¢ÂÂs not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping IÃ¢ÂÂll believe it. But that Ã¢ÂÂ that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.

And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say itÃ¢ÂÂs completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said youÃ¢ÂÂre going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.

There are all these studies out there. But letÃ¢ÂÂs get at the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And youÃ¢ÂÂd think, well, then why lower the rates.

And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people.

(CROSSTALK)

21:18:30: LEHRER: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs where we started. Yeah.

Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?

21:18:34: OBAMA: Well, for 18 months heÃ¢ÂÂs been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, heÃ¢ÂÂs saying that his big, bold idea is, Ã¢ÂÂNever mind.Ã¢ÂÂ

And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. ItÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs math. ItÃ¢ÂÂs arithmetic.

Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates Ã¢ÂÂ the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.

But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.

And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but weÃ¢ÂÂre also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.

And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under Ã¢ÂÂ under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, theyÃ¢ÂÂre the job creators, theyÃ¢ÂÂd be burdened.

But under Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesnÃ¢ÂÂt like to think of himself as small anything, but Ã¢ÂÂ but thatÃ¢ÂÂs how you define small businesses if youÃ¢ÂÂre getting business income.

And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.

21:21:01: LEHRER: All right.

21:21:03: ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on that Ã¢ÂÂ on that point, which is theseÃ¢ÂÂ¦

21:21:04: LEHRER: Just for the Ã¢ÂÂ just for recordÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

21:21:07: ROMNEY: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ the small businesses weÃ¢ÂÂre talking aboutÃ¢ÂÂ¦

21:21:09: LEHRER: Excuse me. Excuse me. Just so everybody understands, weÃ¢ÂÂre way over our first 15 minutes.

21:21:10: ROMNEY: ItÃ¢ÂÂs fun, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it?

21:21:11: LEHRER: ItÃ¢ÂÂs OK, itÃ¢ÂÂs great. No problem. Well, you all donÃ¢ÂÂt have Ã¢ÂÂ you donÃ¢ÂÂt have a problem, I donÃ¢ÂÂt have a problem, because weÃ¢ÂÂre still on the economy. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to come back to taxes. I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too.

OK, but go ahead, sir.

21:21:38: ROMNEY: You bet. Well, President, youÃ¢ÂÂre Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. President, youÃ¢ÂÂre absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not Ã¢ÂÂ not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, theyÃ¢ÂÂre taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half Ã¢ÂÂ half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.

Now, and Ã¢ÂÂ and IÃ¢ÂÂve talked to a guy who has a very small business. HeÃ¢ÂÂs in the electronics business in Ã¢ÂÂ in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.

I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because thereÃ¢ÂÂs nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.

21:22:58: OBAMA: Jim, I Ã¢ÂÂ you may want to move onto another topic, but I Ã¢ÂÂ I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion Ã¢ÂÂ just to give you a sense, over 10 years, thatÃ¢ÂÂs more than our entire defense budget Ã¢ÂÂ and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs plan may work for you.

But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us thatÃ¢ÂÂs not a recipe for job growth. Look, weÃ¢ÂÂve tried this. WeÃ¢ÂÂve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

Bill Clinton tried the approach that IÃ¢ÂÂm talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways, weÃ¢ÂÂve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that theyÃ¢ÂÂve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure weÃ¢ÂÂre not blowing up the deficit.

21:24:40: ROMNEY: Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.

(CROSSTALK)

21:24:42: LEHRER: Well, youÃ¢ÂÂre going to get the first word in the next segment.

21:24:48: ROMNEY: All right. Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word (inaudible) I hope. Let me just make this comment.

(CROSSTALK)

21:24:50: ROMNEY: I think first of all, let me Ã¢ÂÂ let me repeat Ã¢ÂÂ let me repeat what I said. IÃ¢ÂÂm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs point one.

So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but thatÃ¢ÂÂs not my plan.

Number two, letÃ¢ÂÂs look at history. My plan is not like anything thatÃ¢ÂÂs been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.

My priority is putting people back to work in America. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. ItÃ¢ÂÂs absolutely extraordinary. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. ItÃ¢ÂÂs just Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂve got Ã¢ÂÂ when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.

Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.

21:26:01: LEHRER: All right. LetÃ¢ÂÂs talk Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂre still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt.

And the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you Ã¢ÂÂ you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?

21:26:31: ROMNEY: Good. IÃ¢ÂÂm glad you raised that, and itÃ¢ÂÂs a Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs a critical issue. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs not just an economic issue, I think itÃ¢ÂÂs a moral issue. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.

And the amount of debt weÃ¢ÂÂre adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.

So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, theyÃ¢ÂÂre paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.

The presidents would Ã¢ÂÂ president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.

What things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they donÃ¢ÂÂt pass it: Is the program so critical itÃ¢ÂÂs worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, IÃ¢ÂÂll get rid of it. ObamacareÃ¢ÂÂs on my list.

I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way.

OBAMA: I like it.

ROMNEY: Good. OK, good. So IÃ¢ÂÂll get rid of that.

IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry, Jim, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to stop the subsidy to PBS. IÃ¢ÂÂm going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs number one.

Number two, IÃ¢ÂÂll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.

Number three, IÃ¢ÂÂll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.

This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.

The president said heÃ¢ÂÂd cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The presidentÃ¢ÂÂs put it in place as much public debt Ã¢ÂÂ almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.

21:28:35: LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes.

21:28:37: OBAMA: When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.

And despite that, what weÃ¢ÂÂve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didnÃ¢ÂÂt slip into a Great Depression, but what weÃ¢ÂÂve also said is, letÃ¢ÂÂs make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.

So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but werenÃ¢ÂÂt working very well, 18 government Ã¢ÂÂ 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not werenÃ¢ÂÂt helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.

And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.

Now, we all know that weÃ¢ÂÂve got to do more. And so IÃ¢ÂÂve put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. ItÃ¢ÂÂs on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.

And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, thatÃ¢ÂÂs how the commission Ã¢ÂÂ bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.

Let Ã¢ÂÂ let me just finish their point, because youÃ¢ÂÂre looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no.

Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

21:31:15: OBAMA: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.

21:31:22: LEHRER: Mr. President, IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry.

21:31:26: OBAMA: And Ã¢ÂÂ and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.

21:31:28: LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.

21:31:28: OBAMA: Sorry.

21:31:34: LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles? Do you support Simpson-Bowles?

21:31:34: ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.

21:31:35: LEHRER: No, I mean, do you support Simpson-Bowles?

21:31:36: ROMNEY: I have my own plan. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not the same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the president should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.

21:31:48: OBAMA: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what weÃ¢ÂÂve done, made some adjustments to it, and weÃ¢ÂÂre putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion planÃ¢ÂÂ¦

ROMNEY: But youÃ¢ÂÂve been Ã¢ÂÂ but youÃ¢ÂÂve been president four yearsÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

21:31:54: ROMNEY: YouÃ¢ÂÂve been president four years. You said youÃ¢ÂÂd cut the deficit in half. ItÃ¢ÂÂs now four years later. We still have trillion-doll"	0

STEPHANOPOULOS: Good morning and welcome to ""This Week."" Watching everything.

(START VIDEO CLIP)

SAWYER: America's phone records, but also internet searches are under surveillance.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: A secret government program tracking our phones, casting a wide net across the internet.

(START VIDEO CLIP)

OBAMA: I want to be very clear, nobody is listening to your telephone calls.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Has this protected national security?

(START VIDEO CLIP)

ROGERS: This program was used to stop a terrorist attack.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: At what cost to personal privacy?

(START VIDEO CLIP)

PAUL: I am appalled. It's a violation of the Bill of Rights.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: This morning, we cover the controversy from all angles. The reporter who broke the story, Glen Greenwald. The Senator who sounded the alarm, Mark Udall, and the Committee Chairs who approved the program, Senator Diane Feinstein, and Congressman Mike Rogers. Plus our Powerhouse Roundtable on that, and all the weeks politics with ABC's George Will and Matthew Dowd, Nobel Prize Winner Paul Krugman from the New York Times, Congressman Keith Ellison, and Great Van Susteren from Fox News.

ANNOUNCER: From ABC News, This Week with George Stephanopoulos. Reporting from ABC News Headquarters, George Stephanopoulos.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Hello again. The secret struggle to balance national security and individual liberty broke out into open this week, after a series of blockbuster revelations, starting in The Guardian newspaper. We learned that the government has the capacity to track virtually every American phone call, and to scoop up impossibly vast quantities of data across the Internet.

And our first guest is The Guardian columnist getting these scoops, Glenn Greenwald. Thank you for joining us today, Mr. Greenwald. You are really on a roll. You broke another story yesterday showing the scale of the data collection programs. In March 2013, you report the government collected 97 billion pieces of data, almost all of it from outside the U.S. What's the key finding here?

GREENWALD: There are two key findings. One is that there are members of the Congress who have responsibility for oversight, for checking the people who run this vast secret apparatus of spying to make sure they are not abusing their power. These people in Congress have continuously asked for the NSA to provide basic information about how many Americans they are spying on, how many conversations and telephone and chats of -- of Americans they are intercepting, and the NSA continuously tells them, we don't have the capability to tell you that, to even give you a rough estimate.

So what these documents that we published show, that were marked top-secret to prevent the American people from learning about them, was that the NSA keeps extremely precise statistics, all the data that the senators amassed where that the NSA has falsely claimed does not exist. And the other thing that it does, as you said, is it indicates just how vast and massive the NSA is in terms of sweeping up all forms of communication around the globe, including domestically.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You also drew new criticism yesterday from the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. He called the disclosures reckless, said the rush to publish has created significant misimpressions and added that the articles are filled with inaccuracies. Your response to that?"	0
270	"Getting ballot access can be hard for smaller campaigns with fewer resources. Darrell Castle, the candidate for the Constitution Party, is on the ballot in more than two dozen states. Castle said his campaign has faced ballot access obstacles in California, Texas and Oklahoma. Ã¢ÂÂThose states are virtually impossible for a party like mine because they cost so much money,Ã¢ÂÂ Castle said.

Castle isnÃ¢ÂÂt on the ballot in Oklahoma. To be on the ballot there required signatures from at least 3 percent of all votes cast in the state in 2012, or about 40,000 signatures. Castle says this would likely require hiring professionals who often charge a few dollars for each signature.

Roque Ã¢ÂÂRockyÃ¢ÂÂ De La Fuente is running as an independent and is on the ballot in 20 states. As other non-major-party candidates have promised to do, De La Fuente has mounted several legal challenges for ballot access."	1

Photo by Matt McClain

Mitt Romney offered a pragmatic view of the tight Republican race for president Friday at a Denver car dealership, saying that some states are ""long shots"" for him while others are there for the taking.

Colorado, he believed, fell into the latter category - which is why he made the stop in Denver on his way to Utah to attend funeral services for Gordon B. Hinckley.

Hinckley, 97, was president of the Mormon church, of which Romney is a member.

Romney, standing in the parking lot of Freeway Ford, stood with his sleeves rolled up, despite the rapidly dropping temperature, and offered a broad view of Super Tuesday's contest featuring 21 states, including Colorado, holding Republican caucuses or primaries.

""At this stage, I expect to keep on battling and get the nomination,"" he said. ""I'm not going to forecast anything but success.""

The campaign is targeting a series of states in the next few days that Romney could play well in. After Utah, where he enjoys strong support, the former Massachusetts governor will head to Minnesota.

His campaign didn't rule out another trip to Colorado before Tuesday.

The state has seen massive campaign activity this week as Super Tuesday nears, with Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama drawing about 13,000 people at the University of Denver and former President Bill Clinton, stumping for his wife Sen. Hillary Clinton, bringing in about 4,500 at the same location.

Dealership cites 'civic duty'

Romney's event drew about 1,200 supporters, who were shoehorned into the car dealership showroom. It was a last-minute change of venue.

The campaign had planned to host the rally at the Harley Davidson dealership in Thornton, but contacted Freeway Ford General Manager and Vice President Mike Peebles to see if they could have the event there after the motorcycle dealership's owner pulled the plug on the event.

Peebles, who said that the business had not hosted a presidential candidate's visit before, agreed and soon had the place crawling with supporters, Secret Service and media - forcing salespeople from their cubicles and moving cars around to accommodate everyone.

""We're not endorsing him or anything,"" Peebles said. ""We just thought it would be a good thing to help out. Doing our civic duty, right?""

Romney spoke to the crowd for about 20 minutes, offering up his usual talking points about strengthening the economy, adding 100,000 troops to the military, and his experience as a businessman and governor. Romney, whose wealth has been estimated at $250 million, spent years as an investor and venture capitalist.

One area where he didn't spend much time talking was on Western issues, including things such as natural resources.

The economy was where he took his shot at his chief rival, Sen. John McCain - a name that elicited a chorus of boos.

""He has a number of things that are great strengths of his, but he happened to say the economy was not his strong suit,"" Romney said. ""Well, at a time like this in a country like this, I think it is important to have a president for whom the economy is his strong suit.""

Warnings about economy

It was the only real slap at the McCain campaign, which did not return repeated calls for comment.

Romney has been making his hay with the economy. He openly worried about the direction the nation is headed in and suggested that it could be headed for a dip in status amid emerging global economies.

""Unless we get ourselves on the right track, this country could become a second-tier nation,"" he said.

It was a key part of Romney's theme. A poster behind him read ""Washington is broken."" He cited his experience as a governor in a liberal state as proof that he could work with the opposition party and get things accomplished.

Beauprez said that an ability to unify the country is needed and conceded that President Bush has had ""a bunker mentality"" that he believes Romney would not have if elected.

Democrats offered a less rosy view.

""Mitt can't hide the fact that a vote for Romney is a vote for a third Bush term,"" said Damien LaVera, Democratic National Committee spokesman.

Still, the crowd cheered at several points. Afterward, Romney waded through the crowd and signed T-shirts and posed for pictures.

Recently, Romney has been casting himself as the choice of the conservative wing of the party by talking about illegal immigration and family values. The tactic has won some over, but he has not been able to secure an endorsement from Focus on the Family founder James Dobson. Dobson has said, speaking as a private citizen since the Colorado Springs-based group does not endorse candidates, that he would not support McCain."	0
272	"Ã¢ÂÂOne of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the LordÃ¢ÂÂs name in vain. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: Ã¢ÂÂYou shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vainÃ¢ÂÂ (Exodus 20:7). The word Ã¢ÂÂvainÃ¢ÂÂ means Ã¢ÂÂfor no reasonÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂuseless.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written GodÃ¢ÂÂs name was holy and should not be used for regular words.

Ã¢ÂÂDr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that Ã¢ÂÂin this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂSaying the LordÃ¢ÂÂs name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,Ã¢ÂÂ Hagee elaborated. Ã¢ÂÂBut, thatÃ¢ÂÂs precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I donÃ¢ÂÂt think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.Ã¢ÂÂ

The pastor reprimanded: Ã¢ÂÂBut, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.Ã¢ÂÂ

Asked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: Ã¢ÂÂWell, weÃ¢ÂÂd have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If youÃ¢ÂÂre asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using GodÃ¢ÂÂs name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the LordÃ¢ÂÂs name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of GodÃ¢ÂÂs wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our MakerÃ¢ÂÂs good name.Ã¢ÂÂ/religionlo.com/

Galesburg, Illinois

12:13 P.M. CDT



THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Galesburg! (Applause.) Well, itÃ¢ÂÂs good to be home in Illinois! (Applause.) It is good to be back. ItÃ¢ÂÂs good to be back. Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody. (Applause.) Thank you. Everybody, have a seat, have a seat. Well, it is good to be back.



I want to, first of all, thank Knox College -- (applause) -- I want to thank Knox College and your president, Teresa Amott, for having me here today. Give Teresa a big round of applause. (Applause.) I want to thank your Congresswoman, Cheri Bustos, whoÃ¢ÂÂs here. (Applause.) We've got Governor Quinn here. (Applause.) I'm told we've got your Lieutenant Governor, Sheila Simon, is here. (Applause.) There she is. Attorney General Lisa Madigan is here. (Applause.)



I see a bunch of my former colleagues, some folks who I haven't seen in years and I'm looking forward to saying hi to. One in particular I've got to mention, one of my favorites from the Illinois Senate -- John Sullivan is in the house. (Applause.) John was one of my earliest supporters when I was running for the U.S. Senate, and it came in really handy because heÃ¢ÂÂs got, like, 10 brothers and sisters, and his wife has got 10 brothers and sisters -- (laughter) -- so theyÃ¢ÂÂve got this entire precinct just in their family. (Laughter.) And they all look like John -- the brothers do -- so he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have to go to every event. He can just send one of his brothers out. (Laughter.) It is good to see him.



Dick Durbin couldnÃ¢ÂÂt make it today, but he sends his best. And we love Dick. (Applause.) HeÃ¢ÂÂs doing a great job. And weÃ¢ÂÂve got one of my favorite neighbors, the Senator from Missouri, Claire McCaskill, in the house, because weÃ¢ÂÂre going to Missouri later this afternoon. (Applause.)



And all of you are here, and itÃ¢ÂÂs great to see you. (Applause.) And I hope everybody is having a wonderful summer. The weather is perfect. Whoever was in charge of that, good job. (Laughter.)



So, eight years ago, I came here to deliver the commencement address for the class of 2005. Things were a little different back then. For example, I had no gray hair -- (laughter) -- or a motorcade. DidnÃ¢ÂÂt even have a prompter. In fact, there was a problem in terms of printing out the speech because the printer didnÃ¢ÂÂt work here and we had to drive it in from somewhere. (Laughter.) But it was my first big speech as your newest senator.



And on the way here I was telling Cheri and Claire about how important this area was, one of the areas that I spent the most time in outside of Chicago, and how much it represented whatÃ¢ÂÂs best in America and folks who were willing to work hard and do right by their families. And I came here to talk about what a changing economy was doing to the middle class -- and what we, as a country, needed to do to give every American a chance to get ahead in the 21st century.



See, I had just spent a year traveling the state and listening to your stories -- of proud Maytag workers losing their jobs when the plant moved down to Mexico. (Applause.) A lot of folks here remember that. Of teachers whose salaries werenÃ¢ÂÂt keeping up with the rising cost of groceries. (Applause.) Of young people who had the drive and the energy, but not the money to afford a college education. (Applause.)



So these were stories of families who had worked hard, believed in the American Dream, but they felt like the odds were increasingly stacked against them. And they were right. Things had changed.



In the period after World War II, a growing middle class was the engine of our prosperity. Whether you owned a company, or swept its floors, or worked anywhere in between, this country offered you a basic bargain -- a sense that your hard work would be rewarded with fair wages and decent benefits, the chance to buy a home, to save for retirement, and most of all, a chance to hand down a better life for your kids.



But over time, that engine began to stall -- and a lot of folks here saw it -- that bargain began to fray. Technology made some jobs obsolete. Global competition sent a lot of jobs overseas. It became harder for unions to fight for the middle class. Washington doled out bigger tax cuts to the very wealthy and smaller minimum wage increases for the working poor.



And so what happened was that the link between higher productivity and peopleÃ¢ÂÂs wages and salaries was broken. It used to be that, as companies did better, as profits went higher, workers also got a better deal. And that started changing. So the income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical familyÃ¢ÂÂs incomes barely budged.



And towards the end of those three decades, a housing bubble, credit cards, a churning financial sector was keeping the economy artificially juiced up, so sometimes it papered over some of these long-term trends. But by the time I took office in 2009 as your President, we all know the bubble had burst, and it cost millions of Americans their jobs, and their homes, and their savings. And I know a lot of folks in this area were hurt pretty bad. And the decades-long erosion that had been taking place -- the erosion of middle-class security -- was suddenly laid bare for everybody to see.



Now, today, five years after the start of that Great Recession, America has fought its way back. (Applause.) We fought our way back. Together, we saved the auto industry; took on a broken health care system. (Applause.) We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We doubled wind and solar power. (Applause.) Together, we put in place tough new rules on the big banks, and protections to crack down on the worst practices of mortgage lenders and credit card companies. (Applause.) We changed a tax code too skewed in favor of the wealthiest at the expense of working families -- so we changed that, and we locked in tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, and we asked those at the top to pay a little bit more. (Applause.)



So you add it all up, and over the past 40 months, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs. This year, weÃ¢ÂÂre off to our strongest private sector job growth since 1999.



And because we bet on this country, suddenly foreign companies are, too. Right now, more of HondaÃ¢ÂÂs cars are made in America than anyplace else on Earth. (Applause.) Airbus, the European aircraft company, theyÃ¢ÂÂre building new planes in Alabama. (Applause.) And American companies like Ford are replacing outsourcing with insourcing -- theyÃ¢ÂÂre bringing jobs back home. (Applause.)



We sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth. WeÃ¢ÂÂre about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from abroad for the first time in nearly 20 years. (Applause.) The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years. (Applause.) And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. (Applause.)



So thanks to the grit and resilience and determination of the American people -- of folks like you -- weÃ¢ÂÂve been able to clear away the rubble from the financial crisis. We started to lay a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. And it's happening in our own personal lives as well, right? A lot of us tightened our belts, shed debt, maybe cut up a couple of credit cards, refocused on those things that really matter.



As a country, weÃ¢ÂÂve recovered faster and gone further than most other advanced nations in the world. With new American revolutions in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care, we're actually poised to reverse the forces that battered the middle class for so long, and start building an economy where everyone who works hard can get ahead.



But -- and here's the big Ã¢ÂÂbutÃ¢ÂÂ -- IÃ¢ÂÂm here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do. Even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, nearly all the income gains of the past 10 years have continued to flow to the top 1 percent. The average CEO has gotten a raise of nearly 40 percent since 2009. The average American earns less than he or she did in 1999. And companies continue to hold back on hiring those whoÃ¢ÂÂve been out of work for some time.



Today, more students are earning their degree, but soaring costs saddle them with unsustainable debt. Health care costs are slowing down, but a lot of working families havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen any of those savings yet. The stock market rebound helped a lot of families get back much of what they had lost in their 401(k)s, but millions of Americans still have no idea how theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to be able to retire.



So in many ways, the trends that I spoke about here in 2005 -- eight years ago -- the trend of a winner-take-all economy where a few are doing better and better and better, while everybody else just treads water -- those trends have been made worse by the recession. And that's a problem.



This growing inequality not just of result, inequality of opportunity -- this growing inequality is not just morally wrong, itÃ¢ÂÂs bad economics. Because when middle-class families have less to spend, guess what, businesses have fewer consumers. When wealth concentrates at the very top, it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy. When the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther and farther apart, it undermines the very essence of America -- that idea that if you work hard you can make it here.



And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why reversing these trends has to be WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂs highest priority. (Applause.) It has to be Washington's highest priority. (Applause.) ItÃ¢ÂÂs certainly my highest priority. (Applause.)



Unfortunately, over the past couple of years, in particular, Washington hasnÃ¢ÂÂt just ignored this problem; too often, Washington has made things worse. (Applause.)



And I have to say that -- because I'm looking around the room -- I've got some friends here not just who are Democrats, I've got some friends here who are Republicans -- (applause) -- and I worked with in the state legislature and they did great work. But right now, what weÃ¢ÂÂve got in Washington, we've seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest that they wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up. And that fiasco harmed a fragile recovery in 2011 and we can't afford to repeat that.



Then, rather than reduce our deficits with a scalpel -- by cutting out programs we donÃ¢ÂÂt need, fixing ones that we do need that maybe are in need of reform, making government more efficient -- instead of doing that, we've got folks whoÃ¢ÂÂve insisted on leaving in place a meat cleaver called the sequester that's cost jobs. It's harmed growth. It's hurt our military. It's gutted investments in education and science and medical research. (Applause.)



Almost every credible economist will tell you it's been a huge drag on this recovery. And it means that we're underinvesting in the things that this country needs to make it a magnet for good jobs.



Then, over the last six months, this gridlock has gotten worse. I didn't think that was possible. (Laughter.) The good news is a growing number of Republican senators are looking to join their Democratic counterparts and try to get things done in the Senate. So that's good news. (Applause.) For example, they worked together on an immigration bill that economists say will boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars, strengthen border security, make the system work.



But you've got a faction of Republicans in the House who wonÃ¢ÂÂt even give that bill a vote. And that same group gutted a farm bill that AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs farmers depend on, but also America's most vulnerable children depend on.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: Booo --



THE PRESIDENT: And if you ask some of these folks, some of these folks mostly in the House, about their economic agenda how it is that they'll strengthen the middle class, theyÃ¢ÂÂll shift the topic to Ã¢ÂÂout-of-control government spendingÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ- despite the fact that we've cut the deficit by nearly half as a share of the economy since I took office. (Applause.)



Or theyÃ¢ÂÂll talk about government assistance for the poor, despite the fact that theyÃ¢ÂÂve already cut early education for vulnerable kids. They've already cut insurance for people whoÃ¢ÂÂve lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Or theyÃ¢ÂÂll bring up Obamacare -- this is tried and true -- despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery when there was no Obamacare. (Applause.)



AUDIENCE MEMBER: My daughter has insurance now!



THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what this is about. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what this is about. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we've been fighting for.



But with this endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball. And I am here to say this needs to stop. (Applause.) This needs to stop.



This moment does not require short-term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates. Our focus has to be on the basic economic issues that matter most to you, the people we represent. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we have to spend our time on and our energy on and our focus on. (Applause.)



And as Washington prepares to enter another budget debate, the stakes for our middle class and everybody who is fighting to get into the middle class could not be higher. The countries that are passive in the face of a global economy, those countries will lose the competition for good jobs. They will lose the competition for high living standards. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why America has to make the investments necessary to promote long-term growth and shared prosperity -- rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, upgrading our transportation systems, upgrading our information networks. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need to be talking about. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what Washington needs to be focused on.



And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why, over the next several weeks, in towns across this country, I will be engaging the American people in this debate. (Applause.) I'll lay out my ideas for how we build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America, and what it takes to work your way into the middle class in America: Job security, with good wages and durable industries. A good education. A home to call your own. Affordable health care when you get sick. (Applause.) A secure retirement even if youÃ¢ÂÂre not rich. Reducing poverty. Reducing inequality. Growing opportunity. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need right now. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need to be focused on. (Applause.)



Now, some of these ideas IÃ¢ÂÂve talked about before. Some of the ideas I offer will be new. Some will require Congress. Some I will pursue on my own. (Applause.) Some ideas will benefit folks right away. Some will take years to fully implement. But the key is to break through the tendency in Washington to just bounce from crisis to crisis. What we need is not a three-month plan, or even a three-year plan; we need a long-term American strategy, based on steady, persistent effort, to reverse the forces that have conspired against the middle class for decades. That has to be our project. (Applause.)



Now, of course, weÃ¢ÂÂll keep pressing on other key priorities. I want to get this immigration bill done. We still need to work on reducing gun violence. (Applause.) WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to continue to end the war in Afghanistan, rebalance our fight against al Qaeda. (Applause.) We need to combat climate change. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to standing up for civil rights. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to stand up for womenÃ¢ÂÂs rights. (Applause.)



So all those issues are important, and weÃ¢ÂÂll be fighting on every one of those issues. But if we donÃ¢ÂÂt have a growing, thriving middle class then we wonÃ¢ÂÂt have the resources to solve a lot of these problems. We wonÃ¢ÂÂt have the resolve, the optimism, the sense of unity that we need to solve many of these other issues.



Now, in this effort, I will look to work with Republicans as well as Democrats wherever I can. And I sincerely believe that there are members of both parties who understand this moment, understand whatÃ¢ÂÂs at stake, and I will welcome ideas from anybody across the political spectrum. But I will not allow gridlock, or inaction, or willful indifference to get in our way. (Applause.)



That means whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, IÃ¢ÂÂll use it. (Applause.) Where I canÃ¢ÂÂt act on my own and Congress isnÃ¢ÂÂt cooperating, IÃ¢ÂÂll pick up the phone -- IÃ¢ÂÂll call CEOs; IÃ¢ÂÂll call philanthropists; IÃ¢ÂÂll call college presidents; IÃ¢ÂÂll call labor leaders. IÃ¢ÂÂll call anybody who can help -- and enlist them in our efforts. (Applause.)



Because the choices that we, the people, make right now will determine whether or not every American has a fighting chance in the 21st century. And it will lay the foundation for our childrenÃ¢ÂÂs future, our grandchildrenÃ¢ÂÂs future, for all Americans.

So let me give you a quick preview of what IÃ¢ÂÂll be fighting for and why. The first cornerstone of a strong, growing middle class has to be, as I said before, an economy that generates more good jobs in durable, growing industries. That's how this area was built. That's how America prospered. Because anybody who was willing to work, they could go out there and they could find themselves a job, and they could build a life for themselves and their family.



Now, over the past four years, for the first time since the 1990s, the number of American manufacturing jobs has actually gone up instead of down. That's the good news. (Applause.) But we can do more. So IÃ¢ÂÂm going to push new initiatives to help more manufacturers bring more jobs back to the United States. (Applause.) WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue to focus on strategies to make sure our tax code rewards companies that are not shipping jobs overseas, but creating jobs right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)



We want to make sure that -- weÃ¢ÂÂre going to create strategies to make sure that good jobs in wind and solar and natural gas that are lowering costs and, at the same time, reducing dangerous carbon pollution happen right here in the United States. (Applause.)



And something that Cheri and I were talking about on the way over here -- IÃ¢ÂÂm going to be pushing to open more manufacturing innovation institutes that turn regions left behind by global competition into global centers of cutting-edge jobs. So letÃ¢ÂÂs tell the world that America is open for business. (Applause.) I know thereÃ¢ÂÂs an old site right here in Galesburg, over on Monmouth Boulevard -- letÃ¢ÂÂs put some folks to work. (Applause.)



Tomorrow, IÃ¢ÂÂll also visit the Port of Jacksonville, Florida to offer new ideas for doing what America has always done best, which is building things. Pat and I were talking before I came -- backstage -- Pat Quinn -- he was talking about how I came over the Don Moffitt Bridge. (Applause.) But weÃ¢ÂÂve got work to do all across the country. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got ports that arenÃ¢ÂÂt ready for the new supertankers that are going to begin passing through the new Panama Canal in two yearsÃ¢ÂÂ time. If we donÃ¢ÂÂt get that done, those tankers are going to go someplace else. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got more than 100,000 bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare. (Laughter and applause.)



Businesses depend on our transportation systems, on our power grids, on our communications networks. And rebuilding them creates good-paying jobs right now that canÃ¢ÂÂt be outsourced. (Applause.)



And by the way, this isnÃ¢ÂÂt a Democratic idea. Republicans built a lot of stuff. This is the Land of Lincoln. Lincoln was all about building stuff -- first Republican President. (Applause.) And yet, as a share of our economy, we invest less in our infrastructure than we did two decades ago. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs inefficient at a time when itÃ¢ÂÂs as cheap as itÃ¢ÂÂs been since the 1950s to build things. ItÃ¢ÂÂs inexcusable at a time when so many of the workers who build stuff for a living are sitting at home waiting for a call.



The longer we put this off, the more expensive it will be and the less competitive we will be. Businesses of tomorrow will not locate near old roads and outdated ports. TheyÃ¢ÂÂll relocate to places with high-speed Internet, and high-tech schools, and systems that move air and auto traffic faster, and not to mention will get parents home quicker from work because weÃ¢ÂÂll be eliminating some of these traffic jams. And we can watch all of that happen in other countries, and start falling behind, or we can choose to make it happen right here, in the United States. (Applause.)



In an age when jobs know no borders, companies are also going to seek out the countries that boast the most talented citizens, and theyÃ¢ÂÂll reward folks who have the skills and the talents they need -- theyÃ¢ÂÂll reward those folks with good pay.



The days when the wages for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earnings of somebody who got some sort of higher education -- those days are over. Everybody here knows that. There are a whole bunch of folks here whose dads or grandpas worked at a plant, didnÃ¢ÂÂt need a high school education. You could just go there. If you were willing to work hard, you might be able to get two jobs. And you could support your family, have a vacation, own your home. But technology and global competition, theyÃ¢ÂÂre not going away. Those old days arenÃ¢ÂÂt coming back.



So we can either throw up our hands and resign ourselves to diminishing living standards, or we can do what America has always done, which is adapt, and pull together, and fight back, and win. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we have to do. (Applause.)



And that brings me to the second cornerstone of a strong middle class -- and everybody here knows it -- an education that prepares our children and our workers for the global competition that theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to face. (Applause.) And if you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the 21st century. (Laughter and applause.)



If we donÃ¢ÂÂt make this investment, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to put our kids, our workers, and our country at a competitive disadvantage for decades. So we have to begin in the earliest years. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂm going to keep pushing to make high-quality preschool available for every 4-year-old in America. (Applause.) Not just because we know it works for our kids, but because it provides a vital support system for working parents.



And IÃ¢ÂÂm going to take action in the education area to spur innovation that donÃ¢ÂÂt require Congress. (Applause.) So, today, for example, as we speak, federal agencies are moving on my plan to connect 99 percent of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs students to high-speed Internet over the next five years. WeÃ¢ÂÂre making that happen right now. (Applause.) WeÃ¢ÂÂve already begun meeting with business leaders and tech entrepreneurs and innovative educators to identify the best ideas for redesigning our high schools so that they teach the skills required for a high-tech economy.



And weÃ¢ÂÂre also going to keep pushing new efforts to train workers for changing jobs. So here in Galesburg, for example, a lot of the workers that were laid off at Maytag chose to enroll in retraining programs like the one at Carl Sandburg College. (Applause.) And while it didnÃ¢ÂÂt pay off for everyone, a lot of the folks who were retrained found jobs that suited them even better and paid even more than the ones they had lost.



And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂve asked Congress to start a Community College to Career initiative, so that workers can earn the skills that high-tech jobs demand without leaving their hometown. (Applause.) And IÃ¢ÂÂm going to challenge CEOs from some of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs best companies to hire more Americans whoÃ¢ÂÂve got what it takes to fill that job opening but have been laid off for so long that nobody is giving their rÃÂ©sumÃÂ© an honest look.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: More talent!



THE PRESIDENT: That, too.



IÃ¢ÂÂm also going to use the power of my office over the next few months to highlight a topic thatÃ¢ÂÂs straining the budgets of just about every American family -- and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the soaring cost of higher education. (Applause.) Everybody is touched by this, including your President, who had a whole bunch of loans he had to pay off. (Laughter.)



Three years ago, I worked with Democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollars stopped padding the pockets of big banks, and instead helped more kids afford college. (Applause.) Then, I capped loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly incomes for responsible borrowers, so that if somebody graduated and they decided to take a teaching job, for example, that didnÃ¢ÂÂt pay a lot of money, they knew that they were never going to have to pay more than 10 percent of their income and they could afford to go into a profession that they loved. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs in place right now. (Applause.) And this week, weÃ¢ÂÂre working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because of congressional inaction. (Applause.)



So this is all a good start -- but it isnÃ¢ÂÂt enough. Families and taxpayers canÃ¢ÂÂt just keep paying more and more and more into an undisciplined system where costs just keep on going up and up and up. WeÃ¢ÂÂll never have enough loan money, weÃ¢ÂÂll never have enough grant money, to keep up with costs that are going up 5, 6, 7 percent a year. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to get more out of what we pay for.



Now, some colleges are testing new approaches to shorten the path to a degree, or blending teaching with online learning to help students master material and earn credits in less time. In some states, theyÃ¢ÂÂre testing new ways to fund college based not just on how many students enroll, but how many of them graduate, how well did they do.



So this afternoon, IÃ¢ÂÂll visit the University of Central Missouri to highlight their efforts to deliver more bang for the buck to their students. And in the coming months, I will lay out an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle-class students and their families. It is critical that we make sure that college is affordable for every single American whoÃ¢ÂÂs willing to work for it. (Applause.)



Now, so youÃ¢ÂÂve got a good job; you get a good education -- those have always been the key stepping stones into the middle class. But a home of your own has always been the clearest expression of middle-class security. For most families, thatÃ¢ÂÂs your biggest asset. For most families, thatÃ¢ÂÂs where your lifeÃ¢ÂÂs work has been invested. And that changed during the crisis, when we saw millions of middle-class families experience their home values plummeting. The good news is over the past four years, weÃ¢ÂÂve helped more responsible homeowners stay in their homes. And today, sales are up and prices are up, and fewer Americans see their homes underwater.



But weÃ¢ÂÂre not done yet. The key now is to encourage homeownership that isnÃ¢ÂÂt based on unrealistic bubbles, but instead is based on a solid foundation, where buyers and lenders play by the same set of rules, rules that are clear and transparent and fair.



So already, IÃ¢ÂÂve asked Congress to pass a really good, bipartisan idea -- one that was championed, by the way, by Mitt RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs economic advisor -- and this is the idea to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage while rates are still low so they can save thousands of dollars a year. (Applause.) It will be like a tax cut for families who can refinance.



IÃ¢ÂÂm also acting on my own to cut red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but the bank is saying no. WeÃ¢ÂÂll work with both parties to turn the page on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and build a housing finance system thatÃ¢ÂÂs rock-solid for future generations.



So weÃ¢ÂÂve got more work to do to strengthen homeownership in this country. But along with homeownership, the fourth cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in this country is a secure retirement. (Applause.) I hear from too many people across the country, face to face or in letters that they send me, that they feel as if retirement is just receding from their grasp. ItÃ¢ÂÂs getting farther and farther away. They can't see it.



Now, today, a rising stock market has millions of retirement balances going up, and some of the losses that had taken place during the financial crisis have been recovered. But we still live with an upside-down system where those at the top, folks like me, get generous tax incentives to save, while tens of millions of hardworking Americans who are struggling, they get none of those breaks at all. So as we work to reform our tax code, we should find new ways to make it easier for workers to put away money, and free middle-class families from the fear that they won't be able to retire. (Applause.)



And if Congress is looking for a bipartisan place to get started, I should just say they donÃ¢ÂÂt have to look far. We mentioned immigration reform before. Economists show that immigration reform makes undocumented workers pay their full share of taxes, and that actually shores up the Social Security system for years. So we should get that done. (Applause.)



Good job; good education for your kids; home of your own; secure retirement.



Fifth, I'm going to keep focusing on health care -- (applause) -- because middle-class families and small business owners deserve the security of knowing that neither an accident or an illness is going to threaten the dreams that youÃ¢ÂÂve worked a lifetime to build.



As we speak, we're well on our way to fully implementing the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) We're going to implement it. Now, if youÃ¢ÂÂre one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance either through the job or Medicare or Medicaid, you donÃ¢ÂÂt have to do anything, but you do have new benefits and better protections than you did before. You may not know it, but you do. Free checkups, mammograms, discounted medicines if you're on Medicare -- thatÃ¢ÂÂs what the Affordable Care Act means. You're already getting a better deal. No lifetime limits.



If you donÃ¢ÂÂt have health insurance, then starting on October 1st, private plans will actually compete for your business, and you'll be able to comparison-shop online. There will be a marketplace online, just like youÃ¢ÂÂd buy a flat-screen TV or plane tickets or anything else you're doing online, and you'll be able to buy an insurance package that fits your budget and is right for you.



And if you're one of the up to half of all Americans whoÃ¢ÂÂve been sick or have a preexisting condition -- if you look at this auditorium, about half of you probably have a preexisting condition that insurance companies could use to not give you insurance if you lost your job or lost your insurance -- well, this law means that beginning January 1st, insurance companies will finally have to cover you and charge you the same rates as everybody else, even if you have a preexisting condition. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what the Affordable Care Act does. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what it does. (Applause.)



Now, look, I know because I've been living it that there are folks out there who are actively working to make this law fail. And I donÃ¢ÂÂt always understand exactly what their logic is here, why they think giving insurance to folks who donÃ¢ÂÂt have it and making folks with insurance a little more secure, why they think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a bad thing. But despite the politically motivated misinformation campaign, the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down.



So just last week, New York announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50 percent lower than what they're "	0
275	"A new ad from an independent group claims President Barack Obama apologized and showed weakness on Iran.



The ad comes from Secure America Now, which calls itself a ""broad-based grassroots coalition of 2 million national security activists."" A reader in Florida asked us to check it out. It uses clips from an interview Obama gave in the White House during his first days in office with the Arab network Al Arabiya.



A female voiceover says, ""For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology."" (The words ""an apology"" flash across the screen.)



Then it cuts to Obama telling the interviewer, ""Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating.""



The voiceover says, ""He reached out.""



Obama: ""It is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran.""



Voiceover: ""Iran answered with terror, attacks on our troops and nuclear weapons development. Ã¢ÂÂ¦Tell President Obama: no apologies, no weakness. ItÃ¢ÂÂs time to stop Iran.""



The claim that Obama has apologized for America has been used and reused countless times -- always falsely -- and we found that this incarnation is only a hair closer to the truth.



His first interview



Obama sat down with Hisham Melhem, Al ArabiyaÃ¢ÂÂs Washington bureau chief, on Jan. 27, 2009. The network, based in Dubai, is regarded as a less-radical format than Al Jazeera and has been criticized for having a pro-Saudi Arabia bias.



News coverage at the time billed the interview as ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs ""first television interview in the White House,"" according to the New York Times, and ""his first formal television interview as president,"" per the Washington Post. A spokesman for Secure America Now also pointed us to an MSNBC story characterizing the interview as the new presidentÃ¢ÂÂs first.



The Al Arabiya interview was part of a coordinated unveiling of ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs diplomatic initiatives. He had just named former Maine Sen. George Mitchell as special envoy to the Middle East, and before he sent Mitchell off on a tour of the region, he called Arab and Israeli leaders on his first full day in office.



So itÃ¢ÂÂs fair to say this was ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs first interview as president.



No apology



The interview begins with Melhem asking Obama about Mitchell's appointment and how the administration plans to pursue peacemaking between Israelis and Palestinians.

Obama responds:

Well, I think the most important thing is for the United States to get engaged right away. And George Mitchell is somebody of enormous stature. He is one of the few people who have international experience brokering peace deals.

And so what I told him is start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating -- in the past on some of these issues --and we don't always know all the factors that are involved. So let's listen. He's going to be speaking to all the major parties involved. And he will then report back to me. From there we will formulate a specific response.

Ultimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what's best for them. They're going to have to make some decisions. But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people. And that instead, it's time to return to the negotiating table.

And it's going to be difficult, it's going to take time. I don't want to prejudge many of these issues, and I want to make sure that expectations are not raised so that we think that this is going to be resolved in a few months. But if we start the steady progress on these issues, I'm absolutely confident that the United States -- working in tandem with the European Union, with Russia, with all the Arab states in the region -- I'm absolutely certain that we can make significant progress.

The ad uses only his comments, ""Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating."" But Obama was discussing how to begin brokering a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. He was not referring to Iran, as the ad implies.



In addition, we donÃ¢ÂÂt agree that those words equate to an apology. In that statement, and a few others, Obama seemed to be acknowledging that past efforts in the Middle East have been imperfect.



Later, speaking about the wider Arab world, Obama said, ""My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, there's no reason why we can't restore that.""



Nowhere in the interview did Obama use the word ""apology,"" ""apologize"" or ""sorry.""



PolitiFact has examined the apology claim numerous times. Mitt Romney, the likely Republican presidential nominee, wrote in his book and repeated many times that Obama has apologized for America around the world.



But again, there isnÃ¢ÂÂt an ""IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry"" anywhere to be found in ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs speeches or remarks. One expert weÃ¢ÂÂve talked to before says Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing.



""It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity,"" John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told PolitiFact in 2010. ""Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology.""



Our ruling



Secure America NowÃ¢ÂÂs ad says, ""For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology."" The ad particularly emphasizes that Obama apologized.



ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs first television interview after taking office was with the Al Arabiya network at the White House. But the ad gets nothing right beyond that.



By saying ""all too often the United States starts by dictating,"" Obama was not apologizing but being diplomatic about past strategies that failed to yield results. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs more, the ad criticizes ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs approach to Iran, but his quote actually referred to the Israelis and the Palestinians.



The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts and gives an inaccurate impression. We rate it Mostly False."	0

279	"Feb. 4, 2011 Ã¢ÂÂ -- In an exclusive interview with ABC News, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took aim at the newly released House GOP budget, saying it falls far short of what needs to be done to deal with the federal deficit.

""It's really not going to touch the problem,"" Paul said. ""There's a disconnect between Republicans who want a balanced budget but aren't maybe yet brave enough to talk about the cuts to come.""

The plan by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., released on Thursday, would cut non-security discretionary spending by $58 billion by the end of fiscal year 2011, which ends on Sept. 30.

In an far-ranging interview aboard the Capitol Subway, Paul embraced the label ""true believer"" and said staying true to the principles of the Tea Party movement is more important to him than being a Republican. He also refused to rule out a future run for president and suggested it may be time to reduce U.S. force levels in Afghanistan.

Paul has proposed his own plan to cut spending by $500 billion this year. Paul's plan would impose deep across-the-board spending cuts -- including a reduction of 83 percent from the Department of Education, 6 percent from the Department of Defense and the elimination all foreign aid. He considers it just a start.

""I go to a tea party and you know what they say to me? It's not enough. It's not enough. Where's the other trillion you need?"" Paul said.

Paul defended his call to end to all foreign aid -- including the $3 billion the U.S. gives to Israel every year.

""I'm not singling out Israel. I support Israel. I want to be known as a friend of Israel,"" Paul said, ""but not with money you don't have. We can't just borrow from our kids' future and give it to countries even if they are our friends.""

Paul has come under fire from supporters of Israel, but said Israel has enough financial resources to fend for itself.

""I think they're an important ally, but I also think that their per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world,"" Paul said. ""Should we be giving free money or welfare to a wealthy nation? I don't think so.""

And military resources, as well.

""I think they're probably 10 years ahead of any neighboring country,"" he said. ""I think that their defense is very significant and probably well in advance of any of their particular enemies."""	0
280	"Here is a complete transcript of President Obama and Mitt RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs remarks at the third and final presidential debate at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla., on Oct. 22, 2012. Remarks from the two candidates were updated as the debate unfolded.

BOB SCHIEFFER, MODERATOR: Good evening from the campus of Lynn University here in Boca Raton, Florida. This is the fourth and last debate of the 2012 campaign, brought to you by the Commission on Presidential Debates.

This oneÃ¢ÂÂs on foreign policy. IÃ¢ÂÂm Bob Schieffer of CBS News. The questions are mine, and I have not shared them with the candidates or their aides.

SCHIEFFER: The audience has taken a vow of silence Ã¢ÂÂ no applause, no reaction of any kind, except right now when we welcome President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney.

(APPLAUSE)

Gentlemen, your campaigns have agreed to certain rules and they are simple. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve asked me to divide the evening into segments. IÃ¢ÂÂll pose a question at the beginning of each segment. You will each have two minutes to respond and then we will have a general discussion until we move to the next segment.

TonightÃ¢ÂÂs debate, as both of you know, comes on the 50th anniversary of the night that President Kennedy told the world that the Soviet Union had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba, perhaps the closest weÃ¢ÂÂve ever come to nuclear war. And it is a sobering reminder that every president faces at some point an unexpected threat to our national security from abroad.

So letÃ¢ÂÂs begin.

SCHIEFFER: The first segment is the challenge of a changing Middle East and the new face of terrorism. IÃ¢ÂÂm going to put this into two segments so youÃ¢ÂÂll have two topic questions within this one segment on the subject. The first question, and it concerns Libya. The controversy over what happened there continues. Four Americans are dead, including an American ambassador. Questions remain. What happened? What caused it? Was it spontaneous? Was it an intelligence failure? Was it a policy failure? Was there an attempt to mislead people about what really happened?

Governor Romney, you said this was an example of an American policy in the Middle East that is unraveling before our very eyes.

SCHIEFFER: IÃ¢ÂÂd like to hear each of you give your thoughts on that.

Governor Romney, you won the toss. You go first.

ROMNEY: Thank you, Bob. And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening. Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here. And Mr. President, itÃ¢ÂÂs good to be with you again. We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and itÃ¢ÂÂs nice to maybe funny this time, not on purpose. WeÃ¢ÂÂll see what happens.

This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a Ã¢ÂÂ a complete change in the Ã¢ÂÂ the structure and the Ã¢ÂÂ the environment in the Middle East.

With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East. But instead, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events. Of course we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there. We see in Ã¢ÂÂ in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against Ã¢ÂÂ against our people there, four people dead.

Our hearts and Ã¢ÂÂ and minds go out to them. Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al-Qaeda type individuals. We have in Ã¢ÂÂ in Egypt, a Muslim Brotherhood president. And so what weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region. Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon. And Ã¢ÂÂ and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done. I congratulate him on Ã¢ÂÂ on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda.

But we canÃ¢ÂÂt kill our way out of this mess. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the Ã¢ÂÂ the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs certainly not on the run.

ROMNEY: ItÃ¢ÂÂs certainly not hiding. This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.

SCHIEFFER: Mr. President?

OBAMA: Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs what weÃ¢ÂÂve done over the last four years.

We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11. And as a consequence, Al QaedaÃ¢ÂÂs core leadership has been decimated.

In addition, weÃ¢ÂÂre now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security. And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats. Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harmÃ¢ÂÂs way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs exactly what weÃ¢ÂÂre going to do.

But I think itÃ¢ÂÂs important to step back and think about what happened in Libya. Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years. Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend. We stand with them.

OBAMA: Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of. And, you know, Governor Romney, IÃ¢ÂÂm glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.

ROMNEY: Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to Ã¢ÂÂ to kill them, to take them out of the picture.

But my strategy is broader than that. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs important, of course. But the key that weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to pursue is a Ã¢ÂÂ is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own.

We donÃ¢ÂÂt want another Iraq, we donÃ¢ÂÂt want another Afghanistan. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not the right course for us. The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the Ã¢ÂÂ the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these Ã¢ÂÂ these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.

And how do we do that? A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the Ã¢ÂÂ the world reject these Ã¢ÂÂ these terrorists. And the answer they came up with was this:

One, more economic development. We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we Ã¢ÂÂ we push back and give them more economic development.

Number two, better education.

Number three, gender equality.

Number four, the rule of law. We have to help these nations create civil societies.

But whatÃ¢ÂÂs been happening over the last couple of years is, as weÃ¢ÂÂve watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in. And Ã¢ÂÂ and theyÃ¢ÂÂre throughout many nations in the Middle East.

ROMNEY: ItÃ¢ÂÂs wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy.

But next door, of course, we have Egypt. LibyaÃ¢ÂÂs 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population. We want Ã¢ÂÂ we want to make sure that weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing progress throughout the Middle East. With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to Ã¢ÂÂ to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.

And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, weÃ¢ÂÂve got real (inaudible).

SCHIEFFER: WeÃ¢ÂÂll get to that, but letÃ¢ÂÂs give the president a chance.

OBAMA: Governor Romney, IÃ¢ÂÂm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked whatÃ¢ÂÂs the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, theyÃ¢ÂÂre now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold WarÃ¢ÂÂs been over for 20 years.

But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.

You say that youÃ¢ÂÂre not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq. But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now. And the Ã¢ÂÂ the challenge we have Ã¢ÂÂ I know you havenÃ¢ÂÂt been in a position to actually execute foreign policy Ã¢ÂÂ but every time youÃ¢ÂÂve offered an opinion, youÃ¢ÂÂve been wrong. You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.

You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day. You indicated that we shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it. You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan. Then you said we should. Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.

OBAMA: So, what Ã¢ÂÂ what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map. And unfortunately, thatÃ¢ÂÂs the kind of opinions that youÃ¢ÂÂve offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul.

SCHIEFFER: IÃ¢ÂÂm going to add a couple of minutes here to give you a chance to respond.

ROMNEY: Well, of course I donÃ¢ÂÂt concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that IÃ¢ÂÂve said. They donÃ¢ÂÂt happen to be accurate. But Ã¢ÂÂ but I can say this, that weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and Ã¢ÂÂ and confusion. And Ã¢ÂÂ and attacking me is not an agenda. Attacking me is not talking about how weÃ¢ÂÂre going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence.

But IÃ¢ÂÂll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned. First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe. NotÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

ROMNEY: Excuse me. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same Ã¢ÂÂ in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face. Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again. I have clear eyes on this. IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin. And IÃ¢ÂÂm certainly not going to say to him, IÃ¢ÂÂll give you more flexibility after the election. After the election, heÃ¢ÂÂll get more backbone. Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed I believe that there should be a status of forces agreement.

(CROSSTALK)

ROMNEY: Oh you didnÃ¢ÂÂt? You didnÃ¢ÂÂt want a status ofÃ¢ÂÂ¦

OBAMA: What I would not have had done was left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down. And that certainly would not help us in the Middle East.

ROMNEY: IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry, you actually Ã¢ÂÂ there was a Ã¢ÂÂ there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on. That was something I concurred withÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

OBAMA: GovernorÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

ROMNEY: Ã¢ÂÂ¦that your posture. That was my posture as well. You thought it should have been 5,000 troopsÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

OBAMA: Governor?

ROMNEY: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what? The answer was we gotÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

ROMNEY: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ no troops through whatsoever.

OBAMA: This was just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.

ROMNEY: No, IÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

ROMNEY: Ã¢ÂÂ¦IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry thatÃ¢ÂÂs aÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

OBAMA: You Ã¢ÂÂ youÃ¢ÂÂ¦

ROMNEY: Ã¢ÂÂ¦thatÃ¢ÂÂs a Ã¢ÂÂ I indicatedÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

OBAMA: Ã¢ÂÂ¦major speech.

(CROSSTALK)

ROMNEY: Ã¢ÂÂ¦I indicated that you failed to put in place a statusÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

OBAMA: Governor?

(CROSSTALK)

ROMNEY: Ã¢ÂÂ¦of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.

OBAMA: Governor Ã¢ÂÂ here Ã¢ÂÂ hereÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ hereÃ¢ÂÂs one thingÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

OBAMA: Ã¢ÂÂ¦hereÃ¢ÂÂs one thing IÃ¢ÂÂve learned as commander in chief.

(CROSSTALK)

SCHIEFFER: Let him answerÃ¢ÂÂ¦

OBAMA: YouÃ¢ÂÂve got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean. You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq. That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.

Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily. And so what IÃ¢ÂÂve done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts.

Number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in IsraelÃ¢ÂÂs security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region.

Number three, we do have to make sure that weÃ¢ÂÂre protecting religious minorities and women because these countries canÃ¢ÂÂt develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing.

Number four, we do have to develop their economic Ã¢ÂÂ their economic capabilities.

But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we canÃ¢ÂÂt continue to do nation building in these regions. Part of American leadership is making sure that weÃ¢ÂÂre doing nation building here at home. That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.

SCHIEFFER: Let me interject the second topic question in this segment about the Middle East and so on, and that is, you both mentioned Ã¢ÂÂ alluded to this, and that is Syria.

The war in Syria has now spilled over into Lebanon. We have, what, more than 100 people that were killed there in a bomb. There were demonstrations there, eight people dead.

Mr. President, itÃ¢ÂÂs been more than a year since you saw Ã¢ÂÂ you told Assad he had to go. Since then, 30,000 Syrians have died. WeÃ¢ÂÂve had 300,000 refugees.

The war goes on. HeÃ¢ÂÂs still there. Should we reassess our policy and see if we can find a better way to influence events there? Or is that even possible?

And you go first, sir.

OBAMA: What weÃ¢ÂÂve done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go. WeÃ¢ÂÂve mobilized sanctions against that government. We have made sure that they are isolated. We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and weÃ¢ÂÂre particularly interested in making sure that weÃ¢ÂÂre mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.

But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future. And so everything weÃ¢ÂÂre doing, weÃ¢ÂÂre doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.

This Ã¢ÂÂ what weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition. But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that weÃ¢ÂÂre not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region.

And I am confident that AssadÃ¢ÂÂs days are numbered. But what we canÃ¢ÂÂt do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term. SCHIEFFER: Governor?

ROMNEY: Well, letÃ¢ÂÂs step back and talk about whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening in Syria and how important it is. First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster. Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.

ROMNEY: Syria is IranÃ¢ÂÂs only ally in the Arab world. ItÃ¢ÂÂs their route to the sea. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel. And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us. Number two, seeing a Ã¢ÂÂ a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us. And finally, we donÃ¢ÂÂt want to have military involvement there. We donÃ¢ÂÂt want to get drawn into a military conflict.

And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a Ã¢ÂÂ in a form of Ã¢ÂÂ if not government, a form of Ã¢ÂÂ of Ã¢ÂÂ of council that can take the lead in Syria. And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. We do need to make sure that they donÃ¢ÂÂt have arms that get into the Ã¢ÂÂ the wrong hands. Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road. We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with Ã¢ÂÂ with Israel.

But the SaudiÃ¢ÂÂs and the Qatari, and Ã¢ÂÂ and the Turks are all very concerned about this. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre willing to work with us. We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the Ã¢ÂÂ the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties. Recognize Ã¢ÂÂ I believe that Assad must go. I believe he will go. But I believe Ã¢ÂÂ we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a Ã¢ÂÂ as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East.

This Ã¢ÂÂ this is a critical opportunity for America. And what IÃ¢ÂÂm afraid of is weÃ¢ÂÂve watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well weÃ¢ÂÂll let the U.N. deal with it. And Assad Ã¢ÂÂ excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said weÃ¢ÂÂre going to try to have a ceasefire. That didnÃ¢ÂÂt work. Then it went to the Russians and said, letÃ¢ÂÂs see if you can do something. We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military.

SCHIEFFER: All right.

ROMNEY: Ã¢ÂÂ¦by the leadership role.

OBAMA: We are playing the leadership role. We organized the Friends of Syria. We are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support for the opposition. And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term. But going back to Libya Ã¢ÂÂ because this is an example of how we make choices. When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize. We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didnÃ¢ÂÂt stay there.

And to the governorÃ¢ÂÂs credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized. But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle.

Imagine if we had pulled out at that point. You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden. And so we were going to make sure that we finished the job. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us.

But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs exactly what weÃ¢ÂÂre doing.

SCHIEFFER: Governor, can I just ask you, would you go beyond what the administration would do, like for example, would you put in no-fly zones over Syria?

ROMNEY: I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to have our military involved in Syria. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think there is a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage. I donÃ¢ÂÂt anticipate that in the future.

As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us, a responsible government, if possible. And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove Ã¢ÂÂ to remove Assad.

But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our Ã¢ÂÂ of our troops.

SCHIEFFER: Well Ã¢ÂÂ

ROMNEY: And this isnÃ¢ÂÂt Ã¢ÂÂ this isnÃ¢ÂÂt going to be necessary.

We Ã¢ÂÂ we have, with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups. But look, this has been going on for a year. This is a time Ã¢ÂÂ this should have been a time for American leadership. We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties.

As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the Ã¢ÂÂ the insurgents are highly disparate. They havenÃ¢ÂÂt come together. They havenÃ¢ÂÂt formed a unity group, a council of some kind. That needs to happen. America can help that happen. And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.

SCHIEFFER: Can we get a quick response, Mr. President, because I want toÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

OBAMA: Well, IÃ¢ÂÂll Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂll be very quick. What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have different ideas. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs because weÃ¢ÂÂre doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and a Ã¢ÂÂ an effective transition so that we get Assad out. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the kind of leadership weÃ¢ÂÂve shown. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the kind of leadership weÃ¢ÂÂll continue to show.

SCHIEFFER: May I ask you, you know, during the Egyptian turmoil, there came a point when you said it was time for President Mubarak to go.

OBAMA: Right.

SCHIEFFER: Some in your administration thought perhaps we should have waited a while on that. Do you have any regrets about that?

OBAMA: No, I donÃ¢ÂÂt, because I think that America has to stand with democracy. The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.

But what IÃ¢ÂÂve also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities. And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure theyÃ¢ÂÂre doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region. These countries canÃ¢ÂÂt develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need.

They have to abide by their treaty with Israel. That is a red line for us, because not only is IsraelÃ¢ÂÂs security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels.

They have to make sure that theyÃ¢ÂÂre cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism.

And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately whatÃ¢ÂÂs going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities.

Their aspirations are similar to young peopleÃ¢ÂÂs here. They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school. They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future.

And so one of the things that weÃ¢ÂÂve been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way thatÃ¢ÂÂs noncorrupt, thatÃ¢ÂÂs transparent. But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region thereÃ¢ÂÂs some things that weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to do here at home as well.

You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is weÃ¢ÂÂve done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and weÃ¢ÂÂve neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system. And itÃ¢ÂÂs very hard for us to project leadership around the world when weÃ¢ÂÂre not doing what we need to doÃ¢ÂÂ¦

SCHIEFFER: Governor Romney, I want to hear your response to that, but I would just ask you, would you have stuck with Mubarak?

ROMNEY: No. I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his Ã¢ÂÂ his action there. I felt that Ã¢ÂÂ I wish weÃ¢ÂÂd have had a better vision of the future.

I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs term and even further back than that, that weÃ¢ÂÂd have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didnÃ¢ÂÂt explode in the way that it did.

But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support.

Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more Ã¢ÂÂ is peaceful. We want a peaceful planet. We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs our purpose.

And the mantle of leadership for the Ã¢ÂÂ promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America. We didnÃ¢ÂÂt ask for it. But itÃ¢ÂÂs an honor that we have it.

But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong. And that begins with a strong economy here at home. Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger. When the Ã¢ÂÂ when the president of Iraq Ã¢ÂÂ excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a frightening thing.

Former chief of the Ã¢ÂÂ Joint Chiefs of Staff said that Ã¢ÂÂ Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face. This Ã¢ÂÂ we have weakened our economy. We need a strong economy.

We need to have as well a strong military. Our military is second to none in the world. WeÃ¢ÂÂre blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence. But the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that. We need to have strong allies. Our association and connection with our allies is essential to AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs strength. WeÃ¢ÂÂre the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world.

ROMNEY: And, finally, we have to stand by our principles. And if weÃ¢ÂÂre strong in each of those things, American influence will grow. But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs influence will grow. But unfortunately, in Ã¢ÂÂ nowhere in the world is AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs influence greater today than it was four years ago.

SCHIEFFER: All right.

ROMNEY: And thatÃ¢ÂÂs because weÃ¢ÂÂve become weaker in each of those fourÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

SCHIEFFER: Ã¢ÂÂ¦youÃ¢ÂÂre going to get a chance to respond to that, because thatÃ¢ÂÂs a perfect segue into our next segment, and that is, what is AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs role in the world? And that is the question. What do each of you see as our role in the world, and I believe, Governor Romney, itÃ¢ÂÂs your chance to go first.

ROMNEY: Well I Ã¢ÂÂ I absolutely believe that America has a Ã¢ÂÂ a responsibility, and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that Ã¢ÂÂ that make the world more peaceful. And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections. Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace. They donÃ¢ÂÂt vote for war. So we want to promote those principles around the world. We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world.

We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible. But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong. America must lead. And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home. You canÃ¢ÂÂt have 23 million people struggling to get a job. You canÃ¢ÂÂt have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate. You canÃ¢ÂÂt have kids coming out of college, half of them canÃ¢ÂÂt find a job today, or a job thatÃ¢ÂÂs commensurate with their college degree. We have to get our economy going.

And our military, weÃ¢ÂÂve got to strengthen our military long-term. We donÃ¢ÂÂt know what the world is going to throw at us down the road. We Ã¢ÂÂ we make decisions today in the military that Ã¢ÂÂ that will confront challenges we canÃ¢ÂÂt imagine. In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance. And a year later, 9/11 happened. So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military. I will not cut our military budget. We have to also stand by our allies. I Ã¢ÂÂ I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate.

I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us.

And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when Ã¢ÂÂ when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake. We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy.

SCHIEFFER: Mr. President?

OBAMA: America remains the one indispensable nation. And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office.

Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan.

It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade.

This is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements.

MR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.

Before we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama.

SEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal.

Now, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating.

And as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas. We have to stop providing tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States of America."	0

Obama is a shadow president that will not leave the current administration alone. He has been doing everything he can to mess up what Trump is doing. And being a liberal elite, he can get away with it. Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up too. A little odd, no? This concerning practice has gotten on the last nerve of the Trump administration and it shows that they are concerned with what Obama is trying to do. Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be.

Obama first went to Italy when Trump was there to try to disrupt what was going on there. Does he not know when to give up? It seems like now is as good a time as any. ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs administration is currently under investigation for many criminal actions they did while in office. Maybe he wants to try to deflect all of the negative press about him to Trump, like he so often does. But this last on was truly an Obama move.

The liberal media has been attacking the Trump administration for the hotel accommodations snafu that caused them to be without a hotel for awhile. But as it turns out, that was actually the Obama administrationÃ¢ÂÂs problem, not Trumps. So he is getting blamed for something that is clearly not his fault yet again. That is what conservatives have gotten used to over the years. Apparently liberals can do no wrong. When will the mainstream media report on that?

Ã¢ÂÂThe funny thing,Ã¢ÂÂ a White House official said, Ã¢ÂÂis that the United States delegation probably also would not have had hotel rooms if Hillary Clinton had become president. It was already too late by Election Day.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂBut I bet even if Hillary had to sleep in a youth hostel,Ã¢ÂÂ he went on, Ã¢ÂÂno one in the press would say it was her staffsÃ¢ÂÂ fault.Ã¢ÂÂ

That is the double standard that we have to live with as Americans and it will not get any better. What do you think about this whole mess?

President Trump Destroys Everyone at His Wild Press Conference in Trump Tower 8/15/17

Busted! Journos Rush To Spread Fake News Following TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs Latest Press Conference

Donald Trump gave a speech addressing the violence this past weekend in Charlottesville.

During his speech, the President asked if the Ã¢ÂÂalt-leftÃ¢ÂÂ bore as much responsibility for the chaos as its extremist counterparts on the alt-right. Following the publication of an erroneous transcript, journalists and liberal pundits are spreading fake news about what Trump actually said in a rush to condemn him.

PoliticoÃ¢ÂÂs White House reporter Annie Karni was among the first to falsely highlight that Trump had referred to the alt-right as Ã¢ÂÂusÃ¢ÂÂ in his speech. Ã¢ÂÂJust noticed the use of Ã¢ÂÂusÃ¢ÂÂ in this transcript,Ã¢ÂÂ wrote Karni in a now-deleted tweet.

Ã¢ÂÂOkay, what about the alt-left that came charging at us?Ã¢ÂÂ she wrongly quoted the president as saying

Speaking to the press, Trump stated that members of the Ã¢ÂÂalt-leftÃ¢ÂÂ (which is commonly understood to be made up of Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and other social justice groups) were equally responsible for violence as their alt-right counterparts.

In the speech, Trump clearly says Ã¢ÂÂOkay, what about the alt-left that came charging at Ã¢ÂÂem?Ã¢ÂÂ

As KarniÃ¢ÂÂs tweet made the rounds on Twitter, someÃ¢ÂÂincluding CNNÃ¢ÂÂs Brian Stelter cast some doubt on the transcript. Ã¢ÂÂTranscript may be funky,Ã¢ÂÂ he wrote.

Others, like New York TimesÃ¢ÂÂ Maggie Haberman, were less discerning and more eager to spread the fake news to thousands of her followers.

Haberman corrected herself after dozens of people who listened to the clip pointed out the falsehood.

Despite her corrections, variations of the fake news continued to circulate on Twitter as some. One user, Brian Klaas, jumped to erroneous conclusions and wondered if Trump had made a Freudian slip. Ã¢ÂÂTrump lumps himself with his white supremacist supporters,Ã¢ÂÂ wrote Klaas in a now-deleted tweet.

The fake news stems from PoliticoÃ¢ÂÂs inaccurate transcription of Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs speech. A snapshot of the transcript on Archive.is reveals the presence of the fake quote.

The updated version of the transcript fixed the error, but did not acknowledge that any edits were made. Following complaints on Twitter, the transcript has been updated with a correction at the bottom.

Ã¢ÂÂIn a review of the audio, we could not definitively discern TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs exact words at that moment in the news conference,Ã¢ÂÂ the site claims. Rather puzzlingly, Politico had no problem peppering Ã¢ÂÂREPORTERS YELL INDISTINCTLYÃ¢ÂÂ throughout the piece."	1
285	"Mitt RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs pick of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate has rekindled a heated debate over Medicare.



Ryan, R-Wis., is the head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare.



Today, Medicare operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65.



RyanÃ¢ÂÂs idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans. The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called ""premium support."")



Though House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for RyanÃ¢ÂÂs plan, polling shows public opinion is mixed, with older voters the most wary of the plan.



The Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back, saying President Barack Obama has cut ""$700 billion"" out of Medicare. And the Democratic response to that: Well, Paul Ryan cuts that amount, too!



For this check, weÃ¢ÂÂre looking specifically at what Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said on Face the Nation when debating Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom.



""You know, I heard Mitt Romney deride the $700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform,"" Cutter said. ""You know what those cuts are? ItÃ¢ÂÂs taking subsidies away from insurance companies, taking rebates away from prescription drug company. Is that what Mitt Romney wants to protect? And interestingly enough Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget.""

ItÃ¢ÂÂs a lot to digest if youÃ¢ÂÂre not already a Medicare policy wonk, so let us sort it out for you. For now, we are going to put aside the question of whether it is accurate to call them ""cuts"" -- a claim we're checking in another item -- and focus on the question of whether Cutter is correct that Ryan relies on those same reductions in his budget.



$700 billion in Medicare cuts?



Because weÃ¢ÂÂre wonks ourselves at PolitiFact, our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare. Just a few weeks ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking?



Well, there are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally ""cut"" a dollar from the Medicare programÃ¢ÂÂs budget.



Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years.



What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.



Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.



Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would ""cut"" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, weÃ¢ÂÂve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.



Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care lawÃ¢ÂÂs savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion.



The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.



So itÃ¢ÂÂs timing thatÃ¢ÂÂs making the ""cuts"" bigger, not changes to Medicare.



Does the Ryan budget Ã¢ÂÂprotect those cutsÃ¢ÂÂ?



Now onto our second question: Does RyanÃ¢ÂÂs budget keep the reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes.



HereÃ¢ÂÂs what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June, before his selection as RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs running mate:



Stephanopoulos: ""You know, several independent fact-checkers have taken a look at that claim, the $500 billion in Medicare cuts, and said that it's misleading. And in fact, by that accounting, your budget, your own budget, which Gov. Romney has endorsed, would also have $500 billion in Medicare cuts.



Ryan: ""Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. ..."" (Read the full exchange.)



So Ryan has confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings.



The Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after CutterÃ¢ÂÂs remarks, and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law, including the savings for Medicare.



""Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,"" said Lanhee Chen, RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs policy director, in a statement reported by NBC News. ""A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations.""



Cutter, though, was talking about the Ryan budget. We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have the force of law. And its plan for Medicare hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the Congressional Budget Office.



Still, Ryan himself said his plan did include the reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law.



ThatÃ¢ÂÂs because both sides agree on one point: Medicare spending is growing too rapidly, and it needs to reined in.



Our ruling



Cutter said that Romney attacked Obama for cutting $700 billion out of Medicare, but ""Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget."" Again, with this item we are not addressing whether they are cuts, but simply whether she is correctly characterizing Ryan's plan.

Cutter is correct that the Ryan budget plan included cost savings that were part of the future health care law. Just recently, the Romney campaign backed away from that play, saying RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs plan would restore the spending that the health law is set to curtail, such as extra funding for private insurers under the Medicare Advantage plan.



Still, Cutter was right about the Ryan plan. We rate her statement True."	0

JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): President-elect Trump heads to the White House after an earthquake election few expected.



DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division.



TAPPER: Some say, not so fast, as protesters take to the streets in uproar.



UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Not my president!



TAPPER: What will Donald Trump's America and his White House look like? Top adviser and potential Cabinet pick Rudy Giuliani will be here.



Plus, Trump made big campaign promises, from Obamacare.



TRUMP: Repealing and replacing Obamacare.



TAPPER: To immigration.



TRUMP: There will be no amnesty.



TAPPER: And, of course:



TRUMP: We will build a great wall.



TAPPER: But he seems to be already backing off some of his signature lines. What will really get done? And can he work with Congress? An exclusive interview with House Speaker Paul Ryan.



Plus, Clinton concedes.



HILLARY CLINTON (D), FMR. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for.



TAPPER: As Democrats lick their wounds.



CLINTON: I'm not going to sugarcoat it. These have been very, very tough days. TAPPER: Should they have seen it coming? Michael Moore did -- what he says liberals must do now.



Plus, the best political minds will be here with insights on this historic election.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: Hello. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is in transition.



Donald Trump is now president-elect Trump. And the world is watching with bated breath to see just what he has in store for America. Protests against his election, of course, continue this weekend across the country, most of them peaceful, although the mayor of Portland, Oregon, is asking protesters to stand down in the wake of violence against police in that city.



There are some reports of violence against Trump supporters. In Connecticut, two men were arrested for allegedly beating a man holding a Trump sign. Meanwhile, civil rights groups in school districts across the country report an uptick in incidents of intimidation and harassment of minority groups and girls and women.



Graffiti in North Carolina reads: ""Black lives doesn't matter and neither does your votes.""



""Go back to Africa. Make America great again"" was written in a high school bathroom in Minnesota.



Tensions are high and tempers are flaring across the country. The country, of course, may be divided, but the government in Washington, D.C., is not. Republicans now control the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, and, soon, the White House.



So what is on the Trump agenda and how quickly can it get done?



(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)



TAPPER: Joining me now from Janesville, Wisconsin, is House Speaker Paul Ryan.



Mr. Speaker, thanks so much for joining us.



Before we begin talking about legislation and moving forward, I'm just wondering, there are millions of Americans out there, as I'm sure you know, who are frankly terrified about what this America under President Trump will mean for them.



Is there anything that you, as speaker of the House, one of the leaders of the nation, want to say to them?



REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Sure.



First of all, I hate it that people feel this way. And, second of all, they should not. I think people should be rest assured. America is a pluralistic, inclusive country. It has, it has been, and it will continue to be.



So, I really think that people should put their minds at ease. We're going to get to work on solving the big country's problems, getting this economy growing, fixing our national security, you know, fixing our health care problems, getting our budget put together, the things that we have been talking about.



So, I think people should just really put their minds at ease. We are pluralistic. We're inclusive. That's the kind of country we want. That's the country we are. And that's the country we're still going to have.



TAPPER: But just to accept and acknowledge that there are these incidents taking place all over the country...



RYAN: Well, first, yes, I heard your lead-in there. That's terrible. That's awful.



By the way, that's not Republicans. We are the party of Lincoln. People who espouse those views, they're not Republicans. And we don't want them in our party, even if they're thinking about it. And I'm confident Donald Trump feels the same way.



So, there's no place for that. And protests, as long as protests are peaceful, if people want to express themselves that way, that's what we can do in this country. That's what the First Amendment is all about.



TAPPER: Let's move forward to some of the action items.



Obviously, repealing and replacing Obamacare is one of the big items that president-elect Trump and you want to tackle. President-elect Trump recently said there are elements of Obamacare he wants to keep. This is what he to say to ""60 Minutes."" Take a listen.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



QUESTION: Let me does you about Obamacare, which you say you're going to repeal and replace. When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with preconditions are still covered?



[09:05:01]



TRUMP: Yes, because it happens to be one of the -- strongest asset.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: Now, your Better Way agenda talks about spending $25 billion on high-risk pools that would help those with preexisting conditions afford insurance. Where would that $25 billion come from?



RYAN: Well, we actually have it paid for in our bill. You really want me to give you a technical answer to this? It gets a little technical.



The point is, we have in our plan pay for doing that. Here's the bigger point, Jake. We agree. It's in our plan. Donald Trump agrees with this. We need to have a solution for people with preexisting conditions.



In our plan is allowing younger people up to the age of 26 to stay on their parents' plan. So, there are aspects that we have all along agreed to.



TAPPER: Under Obamacare, as you know, millions of people were able to get health insurance for the first time through the expansion of Medicaid.



What is going happen to those people? Will they lose coverage under your plan?



RYAN: Well, if you go -- what I encourage people to do is go to Better.GOP. It's number five on our plan. We put the most detail out of anybody that has put out an Obamacare replacement plan.



And it is to have an answer for everyone with preexisting conditions, people who are the uninsured. The point I would say is this, Jake. We can have a health care system in America where everyone, regardless of income or health condition, can get affordable health insurance, get affordable health care.



This is what we propose. We think a patient-centered system is the right way to do that. And you can have the system without a costly government takeover, like Obamacare, that is cranking up premiums, that is making deductibles so high. Doesn't even feel like you have health insurance. Obamacare is failing. It must replaced.



We're going to do that. We're excited about it. And the point I would put people's minds at ease is, we can fix these problems. We can fix what was broken in health care without breaking what was working in health care. And that's exactly what we're proposing.



And if you want to get any level of detail on this, just go to Better.GOP and see what we have already offered.



TAPPER: Well, as you know, the Medicaid expansion is providing government-paid health insurance to individuals. I mean, that's what it does. So, if you repeal Obamacare, does it repeal also the Medicaid expansion, or would that part of it stay?



RYAN: For example, we propose to replace that with refundable tax credits for people to buy affordable health care insurance.



So, the kinds of reforms that we're talking about will lower the cost of insurance itself. And then a person would have, such as our proposal calls for, a refundable tax credit, like a voucher, to go buy health insurance.



That's much cheaper, much more affordable. And, more importantly, you get to buy what you want to buy, not what the government is making you buy.



TAPPER: Obamacare also provides birth control to women at no cost. Is that going to end or will that remain?



RYAN: Look, I'm not going to get into all the nitty-gritty details of these things.



TAPPER: With all do respect, I don't know that the average woman of child-bearing years out there who relies upon contraception provided by health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act, I don't know that she would think that that's just a nitty-gritty detail. That's...



RYAN: You're asking me detail...



TAPPER: Well, what do you think? Is it important to you?



RYAN: Jake, you're asking me details about legislation -- you're asking me details about legislation that hasn't been written yet.



(CROSSTALK)



TAPPER: Right. But is it important to you? Would that be a principle? Would that be a principle of whatever replaces it, because...



RYAN: I'm not going to get into -- I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about legislation that hasn't even been drafted yet.



TAPPER: Let me ask you a question about improving security at the border. You and Donald Trump both agree you want to improve security at the border. You obviously have different views when it comes to the 10 to 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States.



This is what you said to say back in April during a town hall at Georgetown University:



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



RYAN: I'm a person who believes that, for the undocumented, we have to come up with a solution that doesn't involve mass deportation, that involves giving people the ability to get right with the law to come and earn a legal status while we fix the rest of legal immigration.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: Now take a listen to what president-elect Trump said on ""Morning Joe"" last year.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""MORNING JOE"")



TRUMP: We're going to have a deportation force. And you're going to do it humanely



QUESTION: How are you going to pay for this?



TRUMP: It's very inexpensive.



QUESTION: Are they going to be ripped out of their homes? How?



TRUMP: Can I tell you, they're going back where they came. If they came from a certain country, they're going to be brought back to that country. That's the way it's supposed to be.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: So, Congress writes the laws and controls the purse strings



Is there going to be mass deportation or not? And this isn't just a nitty-gritty detail. There are millions of people who are very worried about this.



RYAN: Sure. Sure.



And I think we should put people's minds at ease. That is not what our focus is. That is not what we're focused on. We're focused on securing the border.



We think that's first and foremost. Before we get into any other immigration issue, we have got to know who's coming and going in the country. We have got to secure the border. So, we believe an enforcement bill, a border security enforcement bill, is really the first priority. And that's what we're focused on.



TAPPER: OK, so it's not a top priority, mass deportation. But, obviously, president-elect Trump thinks it is.



RYAN: No, securing the border is our...



TAPPER: Right.



RYAN: Securing the border is our top priority.



TAPPER: Right, but about what in year two, year three, year four?



RYAN: That's why I'm saying we're not focused on -- we are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump's not planning on that.



[09:10:03]



TAPPER: Well, let me ask you, and does the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, does that impact in any way your sense of mandate or how far you should be willing to go, considering that the woman who lost actually got more votes?



RYAN: I'd say two things.



Look at the expectations going into this. Look at what all the public polling said. Look at what all the prognosticators were saying like the day of the election. He beat all the odds.



Look, what I think people need to stop doing is stop underestimating Donald Trump. A lot of us did that. I think he's very much of the mind-set that there is a need to unify this country, to heal the division in this country, but also there's a mandate and a desire and a commitment to fix the problems as we have laid the solutions out.



So, we all laid out very concrete solutions for why we need to get this country back on track. We're now going to implement the solutions. And we think this is good. We think this is going to help people get out of poverty. We think this is going to grow the economy, make our country more secure, make our border secure, help the military go on offense against ISIS, clean up the red tape that is strangling small businesses, so they can hire people again.



These are good things that we have in store that we're really excited about getting to work on doing for the American people.



TAPPER: One of the things that you don't mention -- and I can certainly understand why -- when you talk about the path forward with president-elect Trump is one of the biggest differences between yourself and Donald Trump policy-wise, having to do with the issue of trade.



In his contract with the American voter, he promised in his 100 days to establish tariffs to discourage companies from laying off workers. Will you pass those tariffs in your first 100 days?



RYAN: Well, I think there's a better way of dealing with that particular issue.



And if you go to number six on our Better Way agenda and you look at the tax reform, this is something that Donald also talked about during the campaign, which is to fix our taxes on border adjustments, which we believe is a smarter way, which is what all the other countries, which is not tariffs, not trade wars.



So, we think there are better ways of dealing with making American products and workers more competitive, and really it's fixing our tax code.



TAPPER: Throughout the campaign, as you know, president-elect Trump talked about tariffs. It could be as high as 35 percent, 45 percent.



RYAN: Yes.



TAPPER: If he comes to you and says, this is what we're doing, what are you going say?



RYAN: The point I'm trying to make is, I think we can achieve what he's trying -- he's trying to make America more competitive. He's trying to make the American worker more competitive. He's trying to make it so that American businesses stay in America.



And we believe the smartest and best way to do that is comprehensive tax reform, which actually makes America much more competitive without any adverse effects, without any collateral damage to the economy.



TAPPER: A minute ago, you were talking about how Donald Trump, the president-elect, expressed concerned to you he wanted to -- or expressed a desire to you that he wanted to unify the country. On that note, I want to turn to staffing at the Trump White House. A



lot of people, including many conservatives, are concerned that Steve Bannon, who is the CEO of the Trump campaign and the chief executive of Breitbart News, that he used Breitbart News to, in their view, the view of conservatives, the view of Republicans, to mainstream white supremacist views, anti-Semitic views, racist views.



Do you have any concerns about Steve Bannon being in the White House?



RYAN: No, I don't have concerns. I have never met the guy. I don't know Steve Bannon, so I have no concerns.



I believe -- I trust Donald's judgment. I think he's going to pick who he thinks will best serve him. And I'm sure we will work well with whoever his chief of staff is, whoever his staff is.



So, I believe that Donald is going to have a great set of choices to make for staffing. I'm also very own encouraged by the fact that my friend, a great conservative from -- a man whose shown he's a true leader, Mike Pence, is going to be running the transition team.



So, I think between Pence running the transition team -- look, Donald is a multibillionaire who has had lots of companies, who has run extremely successful businesses. So, he's done things like this before. He's staffed up. He's run major organizations. He's a successful person. He surrounds himself with successful people.



So, I'm confident he's going to do the same here.



TAPPER: You sound very optimistic and positive about him, but during the campaign, you said that one of the things he said about Judge Curiel fit the textbook definition of racism.



RYAN: Look, I'm not going to relitigate the past. I'm looking for the future.



And I want I mean when I say unifying, getting people back to work, fixing welfare so people -- fixing welfare so people can go from welfare to work, replacing this horrible health care law that is really hurting families, putting health care providers out of business, and replacing it with patient-centered health care, rebuilding our national security so we're safe again, cleaning up the regulatory state, following the Constitution.



I mean, these are all good things for our country that we are now working on putting in place the plan to do just that. That's transformational. That's positive. That's good.



[09:15:01]



TAPPER: The pride of Janesville, House Speaker Paul Ryan, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it.



RYAN: All right, thank you Jake. Take care.



(END VIDEOTAPE) TAPPER: The Trump transition team has been huddled inside Trump Tower all weekend as they work to create an administration, Cabinet nominees, White House staff.



Kellyanne Conway telling reports yesterday that Trump's choice for chief of staff is imminent. That and other picks could tell us a lot about how president-elect Trump plans to govern.



Let's talk about the new Trump administration with top adviser Rudy Giuliani, who is himself rumored to be a contender for several top jobs.



Mr. Mayor, thanks for joining us. And congratulations.



RUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK: Thank you, Jake.



TAPPER: So, I know you're not going to answer...



GIULIANI: Thank you very, very much, Jake.



TAPPER: I know you're not going to answer any questions I have about what jobs you're being considered for.



(LAUGHTER)



TAPPER: So, let me just set that aside.



There's a big issue...



GIULIANI: Thank you.



(LAUGHTER)



TAPPER: There's a big issue at play here as you prepare for the Trump administration.



I know you're more than cognizant of the fact that Donald Trump has hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in businesses and business interests around the nation and throughout the world. During the campaign, he was asked what he would do with his businesses if he won.



Take a listen.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



TRUMP: If I become president, I couldn't care less about my company. It's peanuts. I have Ivanka and Eric and Don sitting there.



Run the company, kids. Have a good time. I'm going to do it for America, OK?



(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)



TRUMP: So, I would be willing to...



QUESTION: So, you will put your assets in a blind trust?



TRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust.



Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don, and Eric run it, but -- is that a blind trust? I don't know.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: I will answer that question. That's not a blind trust. If your kids run your businesses, it's not a blind trust.



In a blind trust, there is an independent trustee who takes over your portfolio and directs it without your input or any input from anyone around you.



Do you think that to avoid any conflicts of interest, not to many questions by the public as to whether he's making decisions at least in part for his own financial reasons, do you think it would be best for Mr. Trump to set up a true blind trust with no involvement from him or his kids?



GIULIANI: Well, first of all, you realize that those laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. For some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt.



I think he's in a very unusual situation. He would basically put his children out of work if -- and they'd have to go start a whole new business, and that would set up the whole -- set up new problems.



So, it would seem to me that if he set up a situation in which the children were running it, there was a legal or clear document that meant that he would not be involved, he would have no interest in it, he would have no input into it, he would just have a passive interest, that would be the kind of thing that would work here.



It's kind of unrealistic to say, you're going to take the business away from the three people who are running it, and give it to some independent person. And, remember, they can't work in the government because of the government rule against nepotism.



So, you would be putting them out of work. So, I think you're going to have to fashion something that is very comfortable, something that's fair, something that assures the American people, as he said, he has no interest in what's going on in the business, and that his children get to run the business they know how to run.



TAPPER: Right.



GIULIANI: And stay out of all government matters.



TAPPER: Well, but, Mr. Mayor, I mean, his children are -- as I don't need to tell you, they are a huge part of his advisory committee. They are advising the transition, Ivanka, Don Jr., and Eric.



Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband, is being talked about as coming on board and working at the White House, even if he's not paid for it.



If he does not set up a truly blind trust, how can the American people have confidence that, when he makes a decision, that he isn't at least partly making it to enrich himself?



GIULIANI: Well, even if he turned it over to an independent trustee and it was the Trump Corporation, you can't -- I mean, there's no perfect way to do this.



You have to have some confidence in the integrity of the president. The man is an enormously wealthy man. I don't think there's any real fear of suspicion that he's seeking to enrich himself by being president. If he wanted to enrich himself, he wouldn't have run for president.



So, I think there can be a way to do this. And, by the way, Jared Kushner has his own company, completely independent of Trump, that is a very, very successful real estate company. He's maybe, you know, one of the biggest in New York. He -- so, Jared is a kind of different, different situation.



TAPPER: Well, I will just say this. And then you can dismiss it as you want. But I'm putting a flag in it right now.



If a blind trust is not set up, this is going to be Donald Trump for the duration of his presidency, because every decision he makes, whether it's the pipeline in North Dakota, or business relationships in Turkey, everything is going to be under the lens of, well, what is the effect of this on his wealth and his family's wealth?



[09:20:07]



I get that you think that that's not a consideration or not as serious a consideration as...



GIULIANI: No, no, no.



What I'm telling you is, the blind trust solution isn't much better, meaning an independent trustee would run it. And any decision that he made, even if he didn't know it, that helped him, somebody would run it down and say, oh, my goodness, he may have made it for that reason.



So, blind trusts aren't perfect either. This is a very special kind of situation.



TAPPER: I think it's far better than -- it's far better than people in his family advising him and then also working on his business. I think...



GIULIANI: But they're not -- once he gets into government, they will not be -- they will not be -- they will not be advising him.



There will be -- there will have to be a wall -- there will have to be a wall between them with regard to government matters and something I'm very familiar with from my days in the Justice Department, which is recusing yourself from decisions that involve you or any financial matter involving you.



TAPPER: All right.



Well, if you thought the issues between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton's State Department were big, fasten your seat belts. But let's move on.



Mr. Trump shook up the Republican primary by...



GIULIANI: Oh, I think, I think, Jake, Jake, Jake, I think that's a very unfair suggestion.



There, you were talking about enormous amounts of cash. I'm counting up to about $230 million that went for specific actions like talking to the IRS. And I don't -- I don't see that happening in a Trump administration.



This man didn't run for president because he wants to get rich. He's rich already.



TAPPER: All right.



GIULIANI: So, I don't think you're going to have that happen unless you try to make it happen.



TAPPER: All right.



Mr. Trump shook up the Republican primary back in December when he made this promise. Take a listen.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



TRUMP: Donald J. Trump is calling all and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is doing on.



(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: So, just a simple question. Is that policy still operative?



GIULIANI: Well, you know, twice, you used things that he changed during the campaign. He did say that. That is correct.



Actually, within a day or two of his saying that, he called me and asked me to put a little group together that included Congressman McCaul, General Flynn -- I can't remember who else, a few other people. We wrote a paper for him. And he amended it to the ban would be restricted to particular countries, and it would not be a ban.



It would involve extreme vetting. The one -- the one place in which he would not let anyone in, unless it was an extraordinary circumstance, would be Syrian refugees. All the rest from countries that contain dangerous populations of radical Islamic extremists, he will subject them to extreme vetting, but not a ban. So, he said that about 100 times during the campaign from the time



that he made that -- from the time that he made that statement.



TAPPER: Yes, he said that was an expansion.



GIULIANI: So, you can go back.



TAPPER: He said it was an expansion of his original proposal.



But let's talk about what you're talking about, specifically, Mr. Trump wanting to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur and also extreme vetting.



Back in June, when Senator Jeff Sessions, a strong supporter and adviser of president-elect Trump, when Senator Sessions was on the program, he identified six countries that might fall into that category, Pakistan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen.



So, now that Mr. Trump has been elected president, can you tell us if those are the six countries that will see a suspension of immigration?



GIULIANI: Well, I would say that those countries are certainly countries where we would have to be very careful.



Now, let's take Egypt, for example. Egypt, we could probably do some pretty good vetting. The Sisi government is a strong ally. It has a pretty good hold on the Muslim Brotherhood. I'm not saying perfect, but they have done a lot of work in reducing the power of the Muslim Brotherhood. They have a very, very mature and really strong army. You could do vetting in Egypt.



Yemen, a lot more volatile, a lot more difficult to do vetting. So, I think this is going to be a country-by-country decision. Pakistan, you can do pretty good vetting. So, a lot of this is going to depend on, you know, how cooperative is the country we're talking about? How many records can we get?



The reason the Syrian problem was so bad, the Syrian refugees, it's not just that you can't vet them, which actually Director Comey and I think about five members of the Obama administration have made clear, that you can't vet these people, these refugees from Syria.



[09:25:12]



The problem also is that Baghdadi has said he is going to put terrorist operatives in with the refugee population. He's told us he's going to do this.



TAPPER: Right.



GIULIANI: So, we would be foolish -- we would be foolish to allow these people to come into the United States.



We're sort of being warned that he's bringing more people into attack us. We already have 1,000 investigations of radical Islamic terrorists in the United States. We can't add another whole group to that.



TAPPER: I want to ask you. Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, was quoted as saying that the Russian government maintained contacts with members of Trump's -- quote -- ""immediate entourage"" during the presidential campaign.



What can you tell us about those contacts?



GIULIANI: I know of no such contacts with the Russian government.



I was pretty deeply involved in the campaign. I was with Donald Trump, you know, day and night for about 100 days actually at one period. So, if that's going on, it's going on somewhere where I didn't see it.



It is true that I think Donald Trump wants to engage Russia in areas where we can work together in a way that Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama failed to do. But, remember, he's going to do it from a different point of view.



You're forgetting his campaign promise of increasing dramatically the size of the military and doing away with the sequester. We're going to go up to 550,000 troops, where we're going down to 420,000.



TAPPER: Well, let me ask you a quick question about troops.



GIULIANI: We're going to go up to 350 ships.



TAPPER: Putin...



GIULIANI: We're going to go up to 350 troops (sic). Let me finish.



TAPPER: Yes.



GIULIANI: We're going to go up to 1,200 modern aircraft. And we're going to increase the size of the Marines from about 27 battalions to 36.



So, he's going to be facing, Putin, with a country that is not diminishing its military, but a country that is dramatically increasing it to Reagan-like levels, so that he can negotiate -- and he talked about this a lot during the campaign -- he's going to negotiate for peace, but with strength, not with a diminishing army.



TAPPER: A spokesman for Putin said that one of the first things that Trump can do as president is to convince NATO to pull back troops from near the Russian border.



Do you have any idea if any decision has been made along those lines?



GIULIANI: No. No decision like that has been made, thought about.



In fact, during the campaign, Donald Trump talked about forward positioning of some troops in NATO as kind of a bargaining chip with some of the NATO countries that are not putting in their fair share, their 2 percent. TAPPER: OK.



GIULIANI: And I think you're going see something more like that.



I think a President Trump would want to increase the impact of NATO, but make sure that these countries are participating. You know, when we were fighting in Iraq and we had some of these countries participating, their armies weren't fighting. They were watching us, the U.K., and Canada fight, and they were just observing.



Well, it can't work that way.



TAPPER: All right.



GIULIANI: They have got to be full participants. And we have to be full participants.



TAPPER: Mr. Mayor, thank you so much. And congratulations again.



GIULIANI: Thank you.



TAPPER: Donald Trump used the power of social media to help propel him into the White House. He instantly was able to fight back against critics, reporters, even members of his own party if they challenged him, which begged the question, what will President Trump' Twitter feed look like?



We now have his answer.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



TRUMP: I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all. I'm going to be very restrained.



I find it tremendous. It is a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It's -- it's where it's at.



I do believe this. I really believe that the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. And I won.

288	"As Americans Save Money, their Government Spends with Reckless Abandon

Posted by Kevin Boland on January 5th, 2010

Last month, the New York Times wrote a story about the rise in the personal savings rate - an encouraging sign that American families are living within their means. The Times reported that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]his was the year of the return to financial sobriety.Ã¢ÂÂ Unfortunately, the same canÃ¢ÂÂt be said for out-of-touch Washington Democrats.

Michael Mandel, the chief economist at Business Week, noted that Ã¢ÂÂMost other journalists and economists have take [sic] the same position-that Americans have reacted to the recession by saving more. But for the U.S. economy as a whole, the savings rate has not gone up-itÃ¢ÂÂs actually fallen.Ã¢ÂÂ

How can that be? The answer is simple: government spending has exploded over the past year, which explains the discrepancies in the following chart:

Mandel explained:

What we see here is that the net national savings-the sum of personal, corporate, and government savings, net of depreciation-has been plunging rather than rising. The net national savings rate fell to -2.5% in the third quarter of 2009, its lowest level since the Great Depression. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs astounding lowÃ¢ÂÂ¦ the government is running such big deficits that they swamp the savings gains in the private sectors . HereÃ¢ÂÂs another way of putting it: The government is borrowing a lot of money and transferring it to the private sector, through fiscal and monetary stimulus. The private sector is using some of those transfers to boost savings. But on net, the countryÃ¢ÂÂs savings rate as a whole is falling.

In other words, the federal government is overwhelming the private sector with deficit spending.

The House Budget Committee Republican Staff complied a lengthy list of all the DemocratsÃ¢ÂÂ spending in last year:

Democrats need to abandon their job-killing agenda thatÃ¢ÂÂs burdening families and small businesses with tax hikes and burying our kids and grandkids under a mountain of debt. All year long, House Republicans have been offering better solutions on the budget, energy, and health care - solutions that recognize that we need to empower the American people, not bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. Until Democrats understand that fundamental truth, weÃ¢ÂÂll never get our fiscal house in order.

289	"Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press.

""He talks tough on some of these issues,"" Rubio said Dec. 13. ""For example, he was going to Ã¢ÂÂcarpet bombÃ¢ÂÂ ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""

Rubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending.

We decided to fact-check RubioÃ¢ÂÂs claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.

CruzÃ¢ÂÂs vote on Rand PaulÃ¢ÂÂs budget proposal

RubioÃ¢ÂÂs campaign pointed to CruzÃ¢ÂÂs 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of PaulÃ¢ÂÂs amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.

PaulÃ¢ÂÂs 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.

RubioÃ¢ÂÂs campaign pointed to PaulÃ¢ÂÂs statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:

""This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,"" Paul wrote. ""It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.""

Under PaulÃ¢ÂÂs proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.

Was PaulÃ¢ÂÂs proposal a Ã¢ÂÂcutÃ¢ÂÂ for defense?

So why did Rubio refer to PaulÃ¢ÂÂs budget as a ""cut"" if defense spending would rise?

""We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,"" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.

But experts questioned whether Rubio can call PaulÃ¢ÂÂs proposal a ""cut.""

""PaulÃ¢ÂÂs defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs budget was an even larger increase),"" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But PaulÃ¢ÂÂs defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.""

PaulÃ¢ÂÂs 2013 proposal for defense was well below ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs request both at the time and now, Harrison said.

Christopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call PaulÃ¢ÂÂs budget a ""cut.""

""As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,"" he said. ""This is misleading.""

Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.

""So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a Ã¢ÂÂcutÃ¢ÂÂ when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,"" Phillips said. ""The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.""

Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to CruzÃ¢ÂÂs vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than PaulÃ¢ÂÂs amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.

""This was a budget, so it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,"" Friedman said.

Our ruling

Rubio said that the only budget Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""

Rubio was referring to CruzÃ¢ÂÂs vote in favor of PaulÃ¢ÂÂs budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized PaulÃ¢ÂÂs plan when he called it a ""cut."" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.

However, there is a kernel of truth here in that PaulÃ¢ÂÂs proposal for defense was below ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs request.

We rate this statement Mostly False."	0
290	"The recent Massachusetts Senate election captivated Americans far beyond the Bay State. In that contest, Republican Scott Brown picked up a seat formerly held by the late Democratic giant Edward Kennedy. Brown's upset victory was aided by a wave of frustration over how Congress and President Barack Obama have been handling health care reform legislation.



During the campaign, Brown said that if he was elected, he would become the 41st Republican senator, enabling the GOP to block the Democratic majority from reaching the 60-vote threshold required to pass key legislation, including a health care bill. The Senate has already passed a version of health care, but it needs to be reconciled with a different bill passed by the House and then signed by the president before it becomes law.



As it happened, Massachusetts passed its own health care reform plan in 2006, with the help of both Republican Gov. Mitt Romney and a heavily Democratic legislature. Brown, then serving in the state Senate, voted for the plan.



On the Jan. 31, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, host Barbara Walters asked Brown about his vote on the Massachusetts plan. ""Why isn't what's good for Massachusetts good for the whole country?"" she asked.



Brown responded, ""In Massachusetts, the free market, the free enterprise has taken control, and they're offering a wide range of plans. I've never ever said that people should not get health insurance. It's just a question of if we're going to take a one-size-fits-all government plan or we're going to do something where the individual states can tailor their plans as we've done.""



When Walters asked him, ""Do you think the whole plan should be scrapped?"" Brown said, ""Yes.""



""The whole plan?"" Walters continued.



""Yes,"" Brown said.



Later, during the show's round-table segment, liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman expressed disbelief at Brown's response.



""That was the most evasive answer,"" Krugman said. ""If you think this is a straightforward guy, that was an incredibly evasive answer on health care, because the Senate bill, which has now stalled, is identical to the Massachusetts health care plan -- the same thing. Only in the finest of fine print is there any difference. He voted for the Massachusetts plan. A majority of voters in Massachusetts who voted for him approve of the Massachusetts health care plan. Nonetheless, their plan is dead.""



We wanted to see whether the Massachusetts plan was indeed ""the same thing"" as the bill passed by the U.S. Senate. So we looked at the details of both plans and consulted with an ideologically diverse group of health policy experts.



The consensus among our experts was that Krugman is basically right on the overall structure, although some of the details differ. As Elizabeth A. McGlynn, associate director of RAND Health, put it, ""Same recipe, different amounts on the ingredients.""



Here are elements of the two plans that are broadly the same, along with some of the differences in details:



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the Senate plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts need to offer health insurance or else pay a penalty. The Senate bill sets the bar for companies at 50 employees, though technically the bill falls short of a mandate.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and U.S. Senate plans involve the use of voluntary ""exchanges"" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the U.S. Senate plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Expansion of Medicaid. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The U.S. Senate plan also expands Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Insurance market regulation. Both plans restructure the insurance market, in similar but slightly different ways. In Massachusetts, the reform bill merged the individual and small-group markets (that is, it merged the market serving individuals not covered by their employer's plan with the market serving smaller employers). The U.S. Senate bill placed new regulations on those two markets but kept them separate. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan, while the U.S. Senate bill allows such dependent coverage up to age 26. And young adults in Massachusetts from age 19 to 26 can purchase a special lower-cost, lower-benefit plan through the exchange; the U.S. Senate bill creates a category of lower-cost, lower-benefit plan in the exchange for those up to age 30 who cannot find affordable coverage.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Limits on the ratio between the highest and lowest premiums. In Massachusetts, the highest premiums can generally only be twice as high as the lowest premiums. The only factors that can be used to vary premiums are age, tobacco use, geographic area, the nature of the employee's industry, an unusually low participation rate (for group plans) and participation in a wellness plan. The U.S. Senate bill allows premiums in the individual and small-group market and on the exchange to vary based only on age (limited to a 3-to-1 ratio), geographic area, family composition and tobacco use (limited to 1.5 -to-1 ratio). Wellness programs do not factor into ratings variations under the Senate bill, but the bill does provide other incentives for such plans.



The bills differ more noticeably in several other areas.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The U.S. Senate bill makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to Medicare Advantage plans -- the HMO option under Medicare. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue. The U.S. Senate bill also authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to approve generic versions of certain drugs. This, too, is a federal rather than a state responsibility.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and the Senate bill are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the Senate bill, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drugmakers, device manufacturers, health insurers and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost (""Cadillac"") health care plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do any of these things.



""The Senate probably has more cost containment,"" said John Holahan, a health expert at the Urban Institute who has studied the Massachusetts plan extensively. ""And the financing is different. But the structure is the same.""



So it seems that there's broad agreement that, despite some operational differences, the broad structure of the Massachusetts health care plan is quite similar to that in the U.S. Senate bill -- certainly more similar than either one is to, say, a single-payer health care plan or even to the current system. Krugman's comparison of the two plans is Mostly True."	0
291	"The resistance against Trump must continueÃ¢ÂÂ¦these arenÃ¢ÂÂt just small ideological differences being played out, or debates where both sides should be calmly and distantly considered. To the contrary, the very foundation and basis of the country we call our own is at stake! That is why this viral guide to getting involved with the opposition is so importantÃ¢ÂÂ¦if you havenÃ¢ÂÂt read it yet, you should absolutely do so now!

And things continue to look dire, and it goes even beyond Trump: GOP Rep Rob McCaskill (R-Texas) Twitter feed, much like the Orange one in the Oval Office, is a huge basket full of crazy. He tweets with glee about global warming Ã¢ÂÂhoaxes.Ã¢ÂÂ He tweets that Americans should boycott Nordstrom for removing IvankaÃ¢ÂÂs merchandise (they were, thatÃ¢ÂÂs why they pulled the line).

The worst tweet from McCaskill, though, was one from Friday, where he very literally wished for another 9/11 just to prove judges wrong. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs right, he tweeted Ã¢ÂÂCanÃ¢ÂÂt wait for the next 9/11 so the 9th District circuit ruling judges will wish they didnÃ¢ÂÂt roll over for enemies wishing death on America #MuslimBan.Ã¢ÂÂ

Um, seem scary to you? With tweets saying the judges would be responsible for a terrorist attack, the administration is laying the groundwork for a deeper police state or for something weÃ¢ÂÂve never had in this country, martial law. Trump is a dictator. While McCaskill may not be smart enough to be in on the plan, heÃ¢ÂÂs certainly complicit and heÃ¢ÂÂs demonstrating what nearly all Republicans are guilty of. He doesnÃ¢ÂÂt care about the American people. He only cares about his party.

This is terrifying, and thereÃ¢ÂÂs never been a more important time to stand up to fight and defend your country. If you are ready to join the opposition but arenÃ¢ÂÂt quite sure how to get involved, take this grassroots call to action today!"	1

U.S.-UNITED KINGDOM RELATIONS

The United States has no closer Ally than the United Kingdom. Following the end of the American Revolution in 1783, the United Kingdom officially recognized American independence, and in 1785 our two countries established diplomatic relations. Other than a brief break in relations during the War of 1812, the United States and the United Kingdom have remained durable partners and Allies. Our partnership is a foundation of our mutual prosperity and security.

The strong relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom reflects our common democratic ideals and values, which are reinforced through cooperation on political, security, and economic issues. Along with other European allies, the United States and the United Kingdom work closely together to combat terrorism, stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and ensure regional security. The United States and the United Kingdom coordinate closely to respond to dangerous and destabilizing actions by Moscow that threaten our security and erode democratic freedoms and institutions including the KremlinÃ¢ÂÂs war against Ukraine, election interference, cyberattacks, use of chemical weapons, the use of corrupt proxies, and human rights violations. In September 2021 the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom signed the Australia, United Kingdom, and United States (AUKUS) security partnership agreement, further solidifying security cooperation between allies.

The United States supports the peace process and devolved political institutions in Northern Ireland and encourages the implementation of the U.S.-brokered 1998 Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good Friday Agreement.

The United States and the United Kingdom preserve and strengthen the historic bonds between our two nations through educational, cultural, and professional exchange and development opportunities. The UK is a top study abroad destination for U.S. students, and in the 2020/21 academic year, more than 8,028 students from the UK studied in the United States. The Fulbright Program in the United Kingdom is one of the oldest and largest in the world. Since 1948, more than 27,000 scholars, students, and teachers have benefited from Fulbright exchanges between the United States and the United Kingdom. Additionally, close to 17,500 UK citizens come to the United States each year on privately funded exchange programs.

U.S. Assistance to the United Kingdom

The International Fund for Ireland (IFI), established by the British and Irish governments in 1986, provides funding for projects to sustain the peace process and to generate cross-community engagement and economic opportunity in Northern Ireland (the United Kingdom) and the border counties of Ireland. The U.S. government has contributed more than $549 million to the IFI since its establishment.

Bilateral Economic Relations

Mutual trade and investment are at the heart of our prosperity, and our commitment to free market values enables our economies to thrive. Following the United KingdomÃ¢ÂÂs 2020 departure from the European Union, the United States continues to be a strong partner to the United Kingdom and looks forward to advancing mutual international trade priorities rooted in our shared values, while promoting innovation and inclusive economic growth for workers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.

The United States and the United Kingdom are the worldÃ¢ÂÂs first and fifth largest economies in the world by GDP. We traded over $273 billion worth of goods and services in 2019. Two-way direct investment totals over $1.3 trillion.

Every U.S. state has jobs that are connected to an investment by a UK company. Nearly 1.3 million Americans work for UK companies in the United States, and over 1.5 million Britons are directly employed by U.S. firms. The top U.S. exports to the United Kingdom include precious metal and stone, aircraft, machinery, financial and travel services, and agricultural products, such as wine and beer.

Leading on Climate

The United States and the United Kingdom are leaders in the global fight against climate change and are committed to taking decisive action to reach our shared goal of achieving net-zero emissions no later than 2050 and keeping the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degree Celsius within reach.

The United States is committed to reducing emissions by 50-52 percent in 2030 compared to 2005 levels, while the UKÃ¢ÂÂs new 2035 target to slash emissions by 78 percent has also set a high bar for other major economies. The UK hosted the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland in 2021, and we will continue to work closely with the UK to secure international commitments that raise ambition on climate action and protect the world from climate change.

The United KingdomÃ¢ÂÂs Membership in International Organizations

Along with France, both the United States and the United Kingdom are among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (P5) and are founding members of NATO. In addition, the United Kingdom and the United States belong to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), G-20, G-7, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and World Trade Organization. As our Ally, and a top contributor at NATO, the UK strengthens the AllianceÃ¢ÂÂs ability to deter modern security and defense threats. The UK leads on key NATO efforts, such as cyber and emerging and disruptive technologies, and is a Framework Nation for the Enhanced Forward Presence in Estonia. The United Kingdom also is an observer to the Organization of American States and a Dialogue Partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

Bilateral Representation

Beau, I love you. I am so proud of you. Proud of the son you are. Proud of the father youÃ¢ÂÂve become. And IÃ¢ÂÂm so proud of my son Hunter, my daughter Ashley, and my wife Jill, the only one who leaves me breathless and speechless at the same time.



It is an honor to share this stage tonight with President Clinton. And last night, it was moving to watch Hillary, one of the great leaders of our party, a woman who has made history and will continue to make history: my colleague and my friend, Senator Hillary Clinton.



And I am honored to represent our first stateÃ¢ÂÂmy stateÃ¢ÂÂDelaware.



Since IÃ¢ÂÂve never been called a man of few words, let me say this as simply as I can: Yes. Yes, I accept your nomination to run and serve alongside our next President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.



Let me make this pledge to you right here and now. For every American who is trying to do the right thing, for all those people in government who are honoring their pledge to uphold the law and respect our Constitution, no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the English language be: Ã¢ÂÂThe vice presidentÃ¢ÂÂs office is on the phone.Ã¢ÂÂ



Barack Obama and I took very different journeys to this destination, but we share a common story. Mine began in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and then Wilmington, Delaware. With a dad who fell on hard economic times, but who always told me: Ã¢ÂÂChamp, when you get knocked down, get up. Get up.Ã¢ÂÂ



I wish that my dad was here tonight, but I am so grateful that my mom, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, is here. You know, she taught her childrenÃ¢ÂÂall the children who flocked to our houseÃ¢ÂÂthat you are defined by your sense of honor, and you are redeemed by your loyalty. She believes bravery lives in every heart and her expectation is that it will be summoned.



Failure at some point in everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable. As a child I stuttered, and she lovingly told me it was because I was so bright I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt get the thoughts out quickly enough. When I was not as well dressed as others, she told me how handsome she thought I was. When I got knocked down by guys bigger than me, she sent me back out and demanded that I bloody their nose so I could walk down that street the next day.



After the accident, she told me, Ã¢ÂÂJoey, God sends no cross you cannot bear.Ã¢ÂÂ And when I triumphed, she was quick to remind me it was because of others.



My motherÃ¢ÂÂs creed is the American creed: No one is better than you. You are everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs equal, and everyone is equal to you.



My parents taught us to live our faith, and treasure our family. We learned the dignity of work, and we were told that anyone can make it if they try.



That was AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs promise. For those of us who grew up in middle-class neighborhoods like Scranton and Wilmington, that was the American dream and we knew it.



But today that American dream feels as if itÃ¢ÂÂs slowly slipping away. I donÃ¢ÂÂt need to tell you that. You feel it every single day in your own lives.



IÃ¢ÂÂve never seen a time when Washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up. Almost every night, I take the train home to Wilmington, sometimes very late. As I look out the window at the homes we pass, I can almost hear what theyÃ¢ÂÂre talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed.



Like millions of Americans, theyÃ¢ÂÂre asking questions as profound as they are ordinary. Questions they never thought they would have to ask:



* Should mom move in with us now that dad is gone?

* Fifty, sixty, seventy dollars to fill up the car?

* WinterÃ¢ÂÂs coming. How we gonna pay the heating bills?

* Another year and no raise?

* Did you hear the company may be cutting our health care?

* Now, we owe more on the house than itÃ¢ÂÂs worth. How are we going to send the kids to college?

* How are we gonna be able to retire?



ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the America that George Bush has left us, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the future John McCain will give us. These are not isolated discussions among families down on their luck. These are common stories among middle-class people who worked hard and played by the rules on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays.



That promise is the bedrock of America. It defines who we are as a people. And now itÃ¢ÂÂs in jeopardy. I know it. You know it. But John McCain doesnÃ¢ÂÂt get it.



Barack Obama gets it. Like many of us, Barack worked his way up. His is a great American story.



You know, I believe the measure of a man isnÃ¢ÂÂt just the road heÃ¢ÂÂs traveled; itÃ¢ÂÂs the choices heÃ¢ÂÂs made along the way. Barack Obama could have done anything after he graduated from college. With all his talent and promise, he could have written his ticket to Wall Street. But thatÃ¢ÂÂs not what he chose to do. He chose to go to Chicago. The South Side. There he met men and women who had lost their jobs. Their neighborhood was devastated when the local steel plant closed. Their dreams deferred. Their dignity shattered. Their self-esteem gone.



And he made their lives the work of his life. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what you do when youÃ¢ÂÂve been raised by a single mom, who worked, went to school and raised two kids on her own. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs how you come to believe, to the very core of your being, that work is more than a paycheck. ItÃ¢ÂÂs dignity. ItÃ¢ÂÂs respect. ItÃ¢ÂÂs about whether you can look your children in the eye and say: weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be ok.



Because Barack made that choice, 150,000 more children and parents have health care in Illinois. He fought to make that happen. And because Barack made that choice, working families in Illinois pay less taxes and more people have moved from welfare to the dignity of work. He got it done.



And when he came to Washington, I watched him hit the ground running, leading the fight to pass the most sweeping ethics reform in a generation. He reached across party lines to pass a law that helps keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. And he moved Congress and the president to give our wounded veterans the care and dignity they deserve.



You can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him, debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure. You learn about the strength of his mind, but even more importantly, you learn about the quality of his heart.



I watched how he touched people, how he inspired them, and I realized he has tapped into the oldest American belief of all: We donÃ¢ÂÂt have to accept a situation we cannot bear.



We have the power to change it. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs Barack Obama, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what he will do for this country. HeÃ¢ÂÂll change it.



John McCain is my friend. WeÃ¢ÂÂve known each other for three decades. WeÃ¢ÂÂve traveled the world together. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a friendship that goes beyond politics. And the personal courage and heroism John demonstrated still amaze me.



But I profoundly disagree with the direction that John wants to take the country. For example,



John thinks that during the Bush years Ã¢ÂÂweÃ¢ÂÂve made great progress economically.Ã¢ÂÂ I think itÃ¢ÂÂs been abysmal.



And in the Senate, John sided with President Bush 95 percent of the time. Give me a break. When John McCain proposes $200 billion in new tax breaks for corporate America, $1 billion alone for just eight of the largest companies, but no relief for 100 million American families, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not change; thatÃ¢ÂÂs more of the same.



Even today, as oil companies post the biggest profits in historyÃ¢ÂÂa half trillion dollars in the last five yearsÃ¢ÂÂhe wants to give them another $4 billion in tax breaks. But he voted time and again against incentives for renewable energy: solar, wind, biofuels. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not change; thatÃ¢ÂÂs more of the same.



Millions of jobs have left our shores, yet John continues to support tax breaks for corporations that send them there. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not change; thatÃ¢ÂÂs more of the same.



He voted 19 times against raising the minimum wage. For people who are struggling just to get to the next day, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not change; thatÃ¢ÂÂs more of the same.



And when he says he will continue to spend $10 billion a month in Iraq when Iraq is sitting on a surplus of nearly $80 billion, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not change; thatÃ¢ÂÂs more of the same.



The choice in this election is clear. These times require more than a good soldier; they require a wise leader, a leader who can deliver changeÃ¢ÂÂthe change everybody knows we need.



Barack Obama will deliver that change. Barack Obama will reform our tax code. HeÃ¢ÂÂll cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people who draw a paycheck. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the change we need.



Barack Obama will transform our economy by making alternative energy a genuine national priority, creating 5 million new jobs and finally freeing us from the grip of foreign oil. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the change we need.



Barack Obama knows that any country that out teaches us today will out-compete us tomorrow. HeÃ¢ÂÂll invest in the next generation of teachers. HeÃ¢ÂÂll make college more affordable. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the change we need.



Barack Obama will bring down health care costs by $2,500 for the typical family, and, at long last, deliver affordable, accessible health care for all Americans. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the change we need.



Barack Obama will put more cops on the streets, put the Ã¢ÂÂsecurityÃ¢ÂÂ back in Social Security and never give up until we achieve equal pay for women. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the change we need.



As we gather here tonight, our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out. For the last seven years, this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century: the emergence of Russia, China and India as great powers; the spread of lethal weapons; the shortage of secure supplies of energy, food and water; the challenge of climate change; and the resurgence of fundamentalism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the real central front against terrorism.



In recent days, weÃ¢ÂÂve once again seen the consequences of this neglect with RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs challenge to the free and democratic country of Georgia. Barack Obama and I will end this neglect. We will hold Russia accountable for its actions, and weÃ¢ÂÂll help the people of Georgia rebuild.



IÃ¢ÂÂve been on the ground in Georgia, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and I can tell you in no uncertain terms: this AdministrationÃ¢ÂÂs policy has been an abject failure. America cannot afford four more years of this.



Now, despite being complicit in this catastrophic foreign policy, John McCain says Barack Obama isnÃ¢ÂÂt ready to protect our national security. Now, let me ask you: whose judgment should we trust? Should we trust John McCainÃ¢ÂÂs judgment when he said only three years ago, Ã¢ÂÂAfghanistanÃ¢ÂÂwe donÃ¢ÂÂt read about it anymore because itÃ¢ÂÂs succeededÃ¢ÂÂ? Or should we trust Barack Obama, who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan?



The fact is, al-Qaida and the TalibanÃ¢ÂÂthe people who actually attacked us on 9/11Ã¢ÂÂhave regrouped in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan and are plotting new attacks. And the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff echoed BarackÃ¢ÂÂs call for more troops.



John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.



Should we trust John McCainÃ¢ÂÂs judgment when he rejected talking with Iran and then asked: What is there to talk about? Or Barack Obama, who said we must talk and make it clear to Iran that its conduct must change.



Now, after seven years of denial, even the Bush administration recognizes that we should talk to Iran, because thatÃ¢ÂÂs the best way to advance our security.



Again, John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.



Should we trust John McCainÃ¢ÂÂs judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from IraqÃ¢ÂÂthat we must stay indefinitely? Or should we listen to Barack Obama, who says shift responsibility to the Iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home?



Now, after six long years, the Bush administration and the Iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home.



John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.



Again and again, on the most important national security issues of our time, John McCain was wrong, and Barack Obama was proven right.



Folks, remember when the world used to trust us? When they looked to us for leadership? With Barack Obama as our president, theyÃ¢ÂÂll look to us again, theyÃ¢ÂÂll trust us again, and weÃ¢ÂÂll be able to lead again.



Jill and I are truly honored to join Barack and Michelle on this journey. When I look at their young childrenÃ¢ÂÂand when I look at my grandchildrenÃ¢ÂÂI realize why IÃ¢ÂÂm here. IÃ¢ÂÂm here for their future.



And I am here for everyone I grew up with in Scranton and Wilmington. I am here for the cops and firefighters, the teachers and assembly line workersÃ¢ÂÂthe folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the American dream endures.



Our greatest presidentsÃ¢ÂÂfrom Abraham Lincoln to Franklin Roosevelt to John KennedyÃ¢ÂÂthey all challenged us to embrace change. Now, itÃ¢ÂÂs our responsibility to meet that challenge.



Millions of Americans have been knocked down. And this is the time as Americans, together, we get back up. Our people are too good, our debt to our parents and grandparents too great, our obligation to our children is too sacred.



These are extraordinary times. This is an extraordinary election. The American people are ready. IÃ¢ÂÂm ready. Barack Obama is ready. This is his time. This is our time. This is AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs time.



May God bless America and protect our troops."	0

295	"Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. HeÃ¢ÂÂs a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid heÃ¢ÂÂs being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. Ã¢ÂÂMy question is pretty straightforward,Ã¢ÂÂ Kline told Price. Ã¢ÂÂWhy do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?Ã¢ÂÂ PriceÃ¢ÂÂs dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. Ã¢ÂÂI took care of a lot of patients with cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂBut, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what youÃ¢ÂÂre doing here, because youÃ¢ÂÂre essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?Ã¢ÂÂ Kline wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt back down. Ã¢ÂÂAre you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?Ã¢ÂÂ Price thought for a second, then replied: Ã¢ÂÂLook, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me Ã¢ÂÂ I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.Ã¢ÂÂ

He continued, Ã¢ÂÂI understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people whoÃ¢ÂÂve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since heÃ¢ÂÂs the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else weÃ¢ÂÂre looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂPut simply, we have to plug some holes Ã¢ÂÂ of which, by the way, there are plenty Ã¢ÂÂ and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,Ã¢ÂÂ the orthopedic surgeon added. Ã¢ÂÂUnfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know itÃ¢ÂÂs not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂm sure you know what IÃ¢ÂÂm talking about, Brian Ã¢ÂÂ they canÃ¢ÂÂt lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂAt the risk of sounding insensitive, weÃ¢ÂÂve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, itÃ¢ÂÂs better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, itÃ¢ÂÂs a lousy way to live anyway, and IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry to say it out loud, but itÃ¢ÂÂs the truth,Ã¢ÂÂ Price concluded."	1

President Obama has taken a great deal of effort to ensure that the Supreme Court will add another extremely qualified legal scholar to the bench. Chief Judge Merrick Garland has already been considered for a seat on the Supreme Court because of his long history of excellent work on the DC Circuit. The President has chosen a man with amazing credentials, a mastery of the law and a history of independent legal thought.



This nation is built on a system of checks and balances: Executive, Legislative and the Courts. For us to be the best nation possible, we must have a full Supreme Court, ready to hear cases that will determine our future as a nation. Republican leadership in the Senate must adhere to a strict reading of the Constitution, advise the President on the nomination and vote on their consent to him joining the Court. It is time for us to put away politics and do our jobs. Americans should accept no less."	0
297	"July 11, 2010 Ã¢ÂÂ -- JAKE TAPPER, HOST: I know that there are some in the White House who feel Wall Street reform, health care legislation, stimulus, and yet the public still overwhelmingly thinks this country is on the wrong track.

Are you not getting enough credit, you and the administration?

JOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look, these are gigantic packages to deal with a gigantic problem we inherited. And the vast majority of the American people and a lot of people really involved don't even know what's inside the packages. And so you have, for example, Mr. Boehner already calling for the repeal of -- of the reform that just passed on Wall Street. People don't realize, in that reform, you know, you say, look, we've had meat inspection for 100 years ago, the meat packing companies didn't like it. Automobile safety 50 years ago.

People are going to look back on this very shortly and say, why shouldn't we have some consumer group in -- entity looking at whether or not you can give someone a mortgage with no down payment, with no -- with a teaser interest rate, with no documentation, etc.

So it is -- people don't know that. Just like people don't know a lot of what's going on in The Recovery Act, understandably, because this has been so much stuff that has been flowing our way. And -- and we're facing a bunch of guys who are good guys, but they're all about repeal and -- and repeat. Repeal what we're doing and go back, repeal the incentives for industry to invest in solar energy. Repeal the health care bill that allows you to keep your kid on your health care policy, precondi -- preexisting conditions can't deny you policies, etc.

It's just going to take time. This is Jan -- this is July. The election is not until November. And I think we're going to have to firmly make our case. I think we can make it and especially in the context of who's going to be opposing us.

Compared to the alternative, I think we're going to get a fair amount of credit by November and I think we're going to do fine.

TAPPER: So the reason you're not getting enough credit is because the public doesn't understand everything that's happened yet?

BIDEN: Well, nor could they or should they. Look, in the last six months of the Bush administration, they lost three million jobs. Before we got our economic package in place, another 3.7 million jobs were lost in the first six months we took office. The last six months of this year -- the first six months of this year, we created almost 600,000 private jobs, you know, in the private market. That's not nearly enough to make up for the eight million jobs lost in the recession. But people are going to start to focus on exactly what we're doing. And all -- look, I'm convinced, at least from sitting around my dad's kitchen table and -- and the people I grew up with is when things are really tough economically and the country is in trouble, all they want to know is, they -- they don't expect an answer, but they expect to be reassured that we're moving in the right direction.

That is...

TAPPER: But they don't think that we are.

BIDEN: No. No, they don't think now because I don't think they know the detail of what's going on.

For example, here you had the insurance industry spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make the health care bill out to be this God awful tragedy.

Now what's starting off to happen?

The health care numbers are going up.

Why?

Because they're figuring out that small businesses are going to get a 30 percent tax cut. They didn't know that because of all the advertising done.

So there's a lot -- and -- and I would use health care as an example. Health care has gone from a barrage of advertising against it, why it was so bad, just like Wall Street reform. The financial industry spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying against this Ã¢ÂÂ this is an awful thing, it's government regulation. All it is, is rational control and the turning around of what the Republicans did, which is let Wall Street run wild.

People -- when you say to people, you know, we just went out and had a regulatory reform bill, where I come from, it's like, OK, what -- what does that mean?

They don't know what it means yet, understandably. And so I think it takes time, Jake.

TAPPER: There's that famous saying in Washington by Mike Kinsley that a gaffe is when a politician accidentally tells the truth. Robert Gibbs experienced some of that this -- this past few days...

BIDEN: I've never had a gaffe.

TAPPER: You've never had an issue with gaffes.

(LAUGHTER)

TAPPER: No, I know. So you can't relate.

BIDEN: Yeah.

TAPPER: But -- but he said that enough seats are in the play in the House for the Democrats to possibly lose the House. Empirically true.

How bad are the losses going to be for Democrats?

BIDEN: I don't think the losses are going to be bad at all. I think we're going to shock the heck out of everybody. I really -- and I've been saying this now. I think even when you and I went down to North Carolina and you followed be on the recovery trip, I was saying it then. I am absolutely confidence -- confident when people take a look at the what has happened since we've taken office in November and comparing it to the alternative, we're going to be very -- we're going to be in great shape.

Here's the deal. What Robert Gibbs also said was what he believes, what I believe, what the president believes, we're going to win the House and we're going to win the Senate. We're not going to lose either one of those bodies.

And so, again, this is July. November and at the time, the most vulnerable time any public official finds himself in is when they have no opponent.

Look at Harry Reid. You know, I got -- I got kind of banged around for saying I think there was a 55 percent chance Harry Reid is going to win. Well, Harry Reid, when he was the -- you know, on the other side of the barrage of how bad Harry Reid was, was in trouble. Now Harry Reid, in the last poll, was up 7 points. I -- he I think he -- I -- I'd bet anything -- I'm not allowed to bet, but I'll bet Harry Reid wins. You're going to see that repeated.

So, that old -- to paraphrase Mark Twain, I think the -- the reports of our demise are premature.

Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE

What is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not Ã¢ÂÂimmigrantsÃ¢ÂÂ but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the townÃ¢ÂÂs population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak."	1
300	"There he is in the photos, aflame with conviction and heady with success: class president, editor on the law review, bold young prosecutor, No. 3 man at the Justice Department, crime-fighting United States Attorney, archenemy of the Mafia, the 107th Mayor of the City of New York. Quite a run!

And now, working from City Hall, Rudolph William Giuliani, 53, has become New York's one ubiquitous figure, hurrying from a burned-out building to a subway derailment to the bedside of a wounded police officer. He is Gotham's action hero, self-cast as the take-charge guy who is reliably among the first at every scene.

By most reckonings, including those of many adversaries, Mr. Giuliani has coupled this celebrity with effective leadership. A seemingly ungovernable city now seems responsive to discipline, its crime rate in a plunge, its tourist-stocked streets palpably safer.

Still, however many his accomplishments, there is something else striking about the Mayor: his temperament. He seems to believe in mayoral infallibility, at least so long as he is the Mayor. To question his righteousness is to risk his wrath. A devil's advocate often seems regarded as the devil himself."	0

One out of every four Pennsylvania households is affected by addiction. More than 2,400 Pennsylvanians died from overdoses last year, making it the leading cause of accidental death in our Commonwealth.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms. More than 4 million Americans abuse prescription drugs or painkillers; another 435,000 use heroin.

These facts are shocking, but they reflect the reality right here in our neighborhoods, in Reading, in Lancaster City, and across Pennsylvania. It is happening to Democrats and Republicans, to people of every race and religion. It happens to our friends, family members, and neighbors. We all know them. And we share their pain.

No one suffers alone. We donÃ¢ÂÂt have the option to think of this as merely a private or personal issue. Every addict comes from a family, and has people who love them and suffer with them. It can be almost unbearable to watch someone you love endure the physical and mental effects of drug abuse. Every addiction hurts not only an addict, but an entire community.

All of us pay the price of addiction, too, because it keeps people from fulfilling their potential and contributing more fully to our society. Drug abuse contributes to unemployment, homelessness, and sex trafficking. It puts pressure on government programs and budgets.

Ninety percent of addicts who need treatment donÃ¢ÂÂt get it. Our health care system is failing not only them, but it is failing all of us. Addiction is treatable. We need to treat it, and we need to educate our young people properly in order to prevent the spread of addiction.

At a time when political acrimony is reaching a record level, leaders in both parties are coming together to find solutions. At the state level, Governor Wolf has ordered every state police vehicle to carry naloxone, an anti-overdose drug that has already saved hundreds of lives.

Congress likewise is working on a bipartisan basis, with the support of the Obama Administration, to make the system work better.

This week, the Senate passed comprehensive legislation to address the addiction crisis. The bill was the result of bipartisan effort, and passed with bipartisan support from both of PennsylvaniaÃ¢ÂÂs Senators.

In November, Congress passed and the President signed into law a bipartisan bill, the Protecting Our Infants Act, to review federal programs to help the newborns of heroin and opiate addicts. Tragically, thousands of babies are exposed to and addicted to drugs like codeine, morphine, or heroin before they are even born. Doctors are able to take these babies through the withdrawal process, however. Our new law will require the federal government to develop a strategy to address any gaps in current research or programs.

In 2015, the Energy and Commerce CommitteeÃ¢ÂÂs Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held five hearings on the drug abuse crisis. In October, as Chairman of the Health Subcommittee, I chaired a two-part hearing at which we heard from experts like the Obama AdministrationÃ¢ÂÂs drug czar Michael Botticelli and Dr. Kenneth Katz of the Lehigh Valley Health Network.

Their testimony was as chilling as it was informative. Director Botticelli testified that over the past decade, the number of people treated for overdoses each year, and the number of babies born with neo-natal abstinence syndrome have both tripled. Dr. Katz told us about a number of adolescents in Allentown whom he has seen hospitalized and even killed after trying a new synthetic strand of cannabis.

At the hearing, we discussed seven bipartisan proposals that would improve federal public health policies and help addicts get treatment. Each of these seven bills deals with a different aspect of the epidemic, because we need a comprehensive plan: not just adequate funding, but targeted funding; not just emergency response, but education and prevention.

These bills would make a number of changes to existing law. They would expand the number of physicians who can prescribe the drug buprenorphine to addicts, develop best practices and a national awareness campaign, ban certain synthetic drugs, help pregnant women who are addicted, and create a patient tracking pilot program.

We arenÃ¢ÂÂt finished. Congress will continue to take action on behalf of the families and communities across Pennsylvania and across the country being shattered by this public health crisis. We will work until the system works.

303	"Oct. 11: The debate over the best way forward intensifies in Washington. Two key voices on the Hill and two experienced military leaders weigh in on the direction a new war strategy should take: Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI); Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC); Gen. Barry McCaffrey (Ret.); and Gen. Richard Myers (Ret.). Plus a roundtable: Ron Brownstein, Paul Gigot, Katty Kay, Bob Woodward.

GREGORY: Realistically, from both of you generals, what is victory in Afghanistan?

GEN. MYERS: Some sort--in my view, it's some sort of stable government. And back to Senator Levin's point...

GREGORY: So we can't leave. We can't pull troops out of Afghanistan until there's a stable government?

GEN. MYERS: I think it has to be a viable, stable government that the people believe in. And if you're going to have Afghan security forces that are effective, they have to be connected to the central government and feel that there's some connection and some direction coming from their central government. Otherwise it doesn't work; they're just in the field doing what they do but there's no connection to the overall mission of that country. So I think clearly that's, that's part of it. And I think there has to be some economic development to give people there hope that there's something beyond...

GREGORY: Yeah.

GEN. MYERS: ...what they're doing today.

GREGORY: Can we beat the Taliban?

GEN. McCAFFREY: Well, I, I think in 10 years of $5 billion a month and with a significant front-end security component, we can leave a Afghan national army and police force and a viable government and roads and universities. But it's a time constraint that we can't change things in 18 to 24 months. So I think we got to lower expectations. Senator Levin talked about our political resolve; is it there or not? You know, sort of a simplistic lesson I learned as an infantry company commander in combat, you only got three choices. When you're under fire you can hunker down and take casualties--it's bad--you can break contact and withdraw or you can reinforce and attack. That's really the, the challenge facing the Obama administration right now. And the, the politics of it are really tough. The American people do not appear to support large-scale continued intervention in this conflict.

GREGORY: Just with, with very little time left, I want to get to two other issues. The president spoke last night at the Human Rights Campaign dinner and spoke about ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell.""

(Videotape)

PRES. OBAMA: I'm working with the Pentagon, its leadership and the members of the House and Senate on ending this policy. Legislation has been introduced in the House to make this happen. I will end ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" That's my commitment to you.

(End videotape)

GREGORY: That, of course, the position of the military to expel gays and lesbians from service.

Senator Levin, will the president live up to this pledge? Can he?

SEN. LEVIN: I think he, he will and he can. I think it has to be done in the, in the right way, which is to get a buy-in from the military, which I think is now possible. Other militaries in the West, the British and other Western armies, have ended this discriminatory policy. We can do it successfully. But it ought to be done with thoughtfulness and with care, and with a buy-in from the military.

GREGORY: General Myers, is it time?

GEN. MYERS: I can't talk about whether it's time or not. I think the process that Senator Levin outlined is exactly right, that the senior military leadership needs to be part of this.

GREGORY: Mm-hmm.

GEN. MYERS: The Pentagon needs to be part of it.

GREGORY: Do you have an opinion about whether it's time?

GEN. MYERS: Well, I, I take some exception to what Senator Levin said, because gays can serve in the military, just can't serve openly. And they, they do and there's lot of them. And we are, and we are, and we're the beneficiary of all that.

GREGORY: OK.

GEN. MYERS: So I'll leave it to the current folks to, to decide whether it's time or not.

GEN. McCAFFREY: Well, there's no question it's time to change the policy. The key to it isn't buy-in from the military, it's for Congress to change the law. They ought to do so. And we would--I'm confident the military will move ahead on it.

SEN. LEVIN: And we, I think, will do that, but we'll need the support at least of some of the military to do it.

GEN. MYERS: I think that's right. You can't...

GREGORY: Does the, does the president have the political resolve to make good on his promise?

SEN. LEVIN: Oh, he does, and I think many of us do.

GREGORY: Yeah.

SEN. LEVIN: I thought it was a mistake to begin with.

GREGORY: Right. Congress has the resolve as well to change it?

SEN. LEVIN: I think we will gain that resolve. The way we've made other changes in this country, the military are the ones that ended a discriminatory policy against African-Americans. They can end it here and it will be great progress.

GREGORY: And finally, Senator Graham, on that question, do you think the military should end the policy?

SEN. GRAHAM: Well, it's my belief that if the policy--you don't have buy-in by the military, that's a disservice to the people in the military. They should be included in this. I'm open-minded to what the military may suggest. But I can tell you, I'm not going to make policy based on a campaign rally.

And when it comes to time, the one thing I would say again about Afghanistan, history will judge not when we left but by what we left behind. And our national security interests will be determined by what we left behind and not when we left. And if this policy about ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" changes, it should be done based not on politics, but on reason.

GREGORY: And, and, finally, Senator Graham, do you think the president deserved the Nobel Peace Prize?

SEN. GRAHAM: If he can successfully turn around Afghanistan, deter Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, I will build a bookcase for him to put it in. It depends on what he does.

GREGORY: Senator Levin?

SEN. LEVIN: I think it was a, a positive statement about hope for America, as well as a recognition of the new direction that he's setting for us.

GREGORY: All right, we are going to leave it there. This debate will continue. Thanks to all of you.

And coming next, Afghanistan, health care and jobs; the politics behind it all. Insights and analysis from our roundtable. Plus, our MEET THE PRESS Minute highlighting some eerie similarities between Afghanistan and Vietnam, only on MEET THE PRESS.

(Announcements)

GREGORY: Our roundtable weighs in--Afghanistan, health care and the economy--after this brief commercial break.

(Announcements)

GREGORY: We are back and joined now by BBC America's Katty Kay, The Washington Post's Bob Woodward, National Journal's Ron Brownstein and Paul Gigot of The Wall Street Journal.

Welcome to all of you. So much to get to this week; war and peace, as I said at the outset. But let's talk about the politics of war, and I think it's striking. Here we are in October of 2009, and it was October of 2001 when President Bush made the decision to go to war. In October of 2009, another president has to make another big decision about troops in Afghanistan, and look how the politics have changed. This was a USA Today/Gallup poll about views of sending more troops, and what you see here is a huge political divide: Democrats, 36 percent for it; Republicans, 73 percent for it. Opponents on the Democratic side, 59 percent to 23 percent.

Bob Woodward, what's different? What are the politics here for this president?

MR. BOB WOODWARD: Well, I, I think what's interesting, instead of trying to figure out the future, what's going on in the White House now? It's extraordinary series of very long meetings. One of the big criticisms of Lyndon Johnson during Vietnam was he wouldn't listen, and Obama is listening. He's on a listening tour, and everyone is getting their say. And he's got to, he's got to make a giant decision not about troop numbers, but what's the strategy? And I think, you know, this is, this is the test for him. Can he come up with some consensus so the military doesn't feel wounded, so his own party doesn't feel wounded? And if he does that, you know, a lot of people, even if they don't agree with the final decision, will say he did something--again, George W. Bush, in deciding to go into Iraq, the model there was he decided...

GREGORY: Right.

MR. WOODWARD: ...""We're going to do it."" All the meetings were about how to do it, never considering other options.

GREGORY: But, but there, there is a real debate about this policy that has broken into the public, and you broke this story with McChrystal's assessment. The vice president is on the cover of Newsweek magazine with his perspective as a, as a counselor to the president on important matters, including this question of Afghanistan. This is played out--we spent a lot of time talking about this in the Bush administration over Iraq. This has really played out publicly.

MR. WOODWARD: But, but--and I think to everyone's benefit, including the president's, including the military and certainly the, the public. Look, if we had had the secret report on WMD in Iraq before the war and published that, history might have been different. It's very important to know, if you can, what these classified memos say. And in the, in this case we have it, and people are talking about something very concrete.

GREGORY: Paul Gigot, the, the question is the president had a strategy. He announced it in March.

MR. PAUL GIGOT: I thought--yeah.

GREGORY: It was clear. This is what Charles Krauthammer wrote on Friday in his column: ""So what does [the] commander-in-chief do now with the war he once declared had to be won but had been almost criminally underresourced by Bush? Perhaps provide the resources to win it? You would think so. ... Obama agonizes publicly and the world watches. Why?"""	0

305	"Fox NewsÃ¢ÂÂ bright and shining primetime star, Tucker Carlson, was involved in a hit and run head-on collision on his way home from his live broadcast of Ã¢ÂÂTucker Carlson Tonight,Ã¢ÂÂ which is shot at Fox News in New York City. NYC Police Sargeant Michael OÃ¢ÂÂLeary told reporters that while he couldnÃ¢ÂÂt confirm the identity of the driver, a well-known news anchor was rammed in what looked like an act of violence and not an accident.

EMTÃ¢ÂÂs on the scene were heard on their radios describing the man as Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson after retrieving his wallet. He was transported to Saint MaryÃ¢ÂÂs where he is said to be in critical condition and awaiting surgery. No other information is available from the hospital, which also refuses to release anything until they get the OK from police.

The car that crossed the median and struck Carlson had a reinforced bumper and the steering wheel was covered with foam to provide the driver extra protection from a crash. ItÃ¢ÂÂs obvious that someone wanted to do harm to another human being on purpose. Whether or not Carlson was specifically targeted or just in the wrong place at the wrong time remains unknown. The perpetrator fled the scene. The Ford Explorer he was driving had no plates or VIN numbers. Police have impounded it as evidence.

Our thoughts and prayers are with TuckerÃ¢ÂÂs family tonight. This is a developing story that will be updated."	1

311	"A ship owned and operated by the Clinton Foundation was raided as it arrived from Africa this morning at the Port of Baltimore. The ship, which was supposed to be carrying Ã¢ÂÂemergency supplies,Ã¢ÂÂ was actually carrying a cargo that had authorities stunned. BPA Harbormaster Jake Cummings explained to CNN:

Ã¢ÂÂWe received a tip that the Clinton Foundation flagship, The Chelsea, was carrying illegal contraband into the United States. We honestly didnÃ¢ÂÂt know what to expect, but what we found was simplyÃ¢ÂÂ¦surreal. In the middle of the shipÃ¢ÂÂs large manifest of containers, most of which were empty, we found 14 containingÃ¢ÂÂ¦people. Yes, people. They were all Refugees from places like Yemen and Syria and not a single one had any kind of documentation. We interviewed those who spoke English and were told that for $40K, anyone can catch a ride to the United States on a ship nobody would ever suspect.Ã¢ÂÂ

Immigration was immediately called and found that of the 460 people on board illegally, not one had been through any kind of vetting process. After running the men through facial recognition, they found more than a dozen suspected terrorists who are on the US no-fly list. Those men were about to be unleashed on the public for $40K each."	1

ArrowRight But that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project Ã¢ÂÂ billionaire developer Donald Trump Ã¢ÂÂ put himself at the center of the nationÃ¢ÂÂs debate over illegal immigration.

Trump garnered headlines Ã¢ÂÂ and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him Ã¢ÂÂ when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and Ã¢ÂÂrapistsÃ¢ÂÂ crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico.

But a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs Ã¢ÂÂ while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs.

Since Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments. Here are some of the key moments. (Video: The Washington Post)

All of them said they have been talking about Trump ever since his inflammatory remarks dominated coverage of his presidential announcement on June 16.

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs something ironic,Ã¢ÂÂ said Ivan Arellano, 29, who is from Mexico and obtained legal status through marriage. He now works as a mason laying the stonework for the lobby floor and walls of what will become the Trump International Hotel.

Ã¢ÂÂThe majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally,Ã¢ÂÂ Arellano said in Spanish. Ã¢ÂÂAnd weÃ¢ÂÂre all here working very hard to build a better life for our families.Ã¢ÂÂ

Interviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.

Several of the men, who hail mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have earned U.S. citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally.

Ã¢ÂÂMost of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem,Ã¢ÂÂ said Daniel Gonzalez, 45, a sheet metal worker from El Salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his countryÃ¢ÂÂs civil war. He became a U.S. citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum, he said.

Ã¢ÂÂHe might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here,Ã¢ÂÂ Gonzalez said of Trump.

Donald Trump announces presidential run + 23 The real estate mogul and reality TV celebrity, announced he would seek the GOP presidential nomination.

Several of the laborers Ã¢ÂÂ who travel to work from as far away as Baltimore or Manassas, Va., every day Ã¢ÂÂ fumed at TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs comments, saying that they have led honest lives that have allowed them to buy homes and raise U.S.-born children.

Ã¢ÂÂDo you think that when weÃ¢ÂÂre hanging out there from the eighth floor that weÃ¢ÂÂre raping or selling drugs?Ã¢ÂÂ Ramon Alvarez, 48, a window worker from El Salvador, said during a break Monday morning just outside the construction site. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre risking our lives and our health. A lot of the chemicals we deal with are toxic.Ã¢ÂÂ

In response to questions from The Washington Post, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the siteÃ¢ÂÂs several hundred workers.

Ã¢ÂÂOur contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law,Ã¢ÂÂ the ÃÂ­e-mailed statement said.

Lend Lease, the lead contractor at the site, Ã¢ÂÂrequires all contractors performing work at the project to follow all applicable federal, state and local laws,Ã¢ÂÂ the statement said.

Michael D. Cohen, executive vice president and legal counsel to Trump, said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.

Ã¢ÂÂMr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor,Ã¢ÂÂ Cohen said in a telephone interview. Ã¢ÂÂThat company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employeesÃ¢ÂÂ status is accurate.Ã¢ÂÂ

A spokeswoman for Lend Lease declined to comment on any aspects of the project, which is expected to be finished by early 2016.

Hicks, also a spokeswoman for TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs political operation, said the campaign had no comment on the matter.

TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs comments about illegal immigration Ã¢ÂÂ which included a promise to Ã¢ÂÂbuild a great, great wall on our southern borderÃ¢ÂÂ and bill Mexico for the cost Ã¢ÂÂ reflect deep-rooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the United States. Yet, concerns raised by workers at one of his companyÃ¢ÂÂs real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarized the country.

The rapid rejection of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs comments by some of his business partners may also reflect how perilous a topic immigration is, not just for Trump but the entire Republican presidential field.

TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs comments were popular with conservative activists across the country Ã¢ÂÂ and may even have helped elevate his status, with polls in the early nominating states Iowa and New Hampshire showing him gaining ground. But they were less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate that serves as a consumer base for the influential corporate entities that were quick to distance themselves from the mogulÃ¢ÂÂs remarks.

The NBC television network, the Macy's department store chain and several other businesses have since severed ties with Trump Ã¢ÂÂ part of a backlash that has cheered Democrats and caused worry among Republicans seeking to win more Latino votes.

On Monday, several hundred people had also signed an online petition asking D.C. chef JosÃÂ© AndrÃÂ©s to ""dump Trump"" by backing out of his deal to open the flagship restaurant at Trump's hotel.



At the mammoth construction site in Washington that bears TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs name, workers said the controversy has caused some worry as they sandblast through layers of chipped paint in the 114-year-old building, install air-conditioning systems that will cool the new hotelÃ¢ÂÂs 271 guest rooms, or cling to a scaffolding while they install windows.

The site is a bustling microcosm of blue-collar work life in Washington Ã¢ÂÂ with soaring turrets and a majestic clock tower that evoke the buildingÃ¢ÂÂs heyday as the DistrictÃ¢ÂÂs main post office in the early 20th century.

Trucks roll in and out of the construction site carrying heavy loads of cement or carting off piles of debris. Over the din of surrounding traffic, foremen yell instructions to their charges, urging them to press forward on a project that will also include a massive ballroom, high-end restaurants and two luxurious suites in the former offices of the postmaster general.

Arms covered in dust, crowds of men recently took a break just outside the site while still wearing their hard hats and bright yellow construction vests, smoking cigarettes or arguing about sports in both English and Spanish.

Ahmad Samadi, 26, a site foreman who arrived last year from Afghanistan under U.S. political asylum, said he has had to learn some Spanish to communicate with his crew. Ã¢ÂÂMost of the workers here are migrants,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Pausing, Samadi added about Trump: Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt think itÃ¢ÂÂs right, what he said. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre hard workers.Ã¢ÂÂ

For David Montoya, 28, TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs comments are a harsh reminder that anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is vulnerable to stricter immigration laws in the country. A truck driver at the hotel site, Montoya arrived from El Salvador in 1997, gaining temporary protected status from deportation in 2001. Ã¢ÂÂEvery 18 months, I have to get it renewed,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, in perfect English, adding that he dreams of permanent legal status.

Montoya reflected on his journey as an immigrant, which now includes three U.S.-born children and a house that he and his wife own in a quiet section of Silver Spring, Md. He noted with pride that he thinks his story Ã¢ÂÂ one of coming to a new world, and of hard work paying off Ã¢ÂÂ is more impressive than that of the powerful developer whose name adorned the sign behind him as he spoke.

Ã¢ÂÂActually,Ã¢ÂÂ he reflected, Ã¢ÂÂweÃ¢ÂÂre more American than him.Ã¢ÂÂ"	0

315	"Such a reaction would be understandable if Saeed Jalili , the most anti-Western ultraconservative candidate, had won. But why has the Israeli government greeted Rouhani with hostility? The common refrain in Israel is that Rouhani's moderate image Ã¢ÂÂ in contrast to his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Ã¢ÂÂ will hamper Israel's efforts to keep Iran isolated. Furthermore, Rouhani's moderate tone could fool the United States and Europe into a false sense of security, resulting in the lifting of sanctions against Iran and even passivity toward the threat of Iran's nuclear program. Such concern likely peaked after Rouhani's recent visit to the United Nations General Assembly, which led to a number of milestones in Iran's troubled relationship with the U.S. The meeting between Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry Ã¢ÂÂ the first such formal talks between the two countries since the 1978 Iranian Revolution Ã¢ÂÂ was followed by another major unprecedented milestone: a phone call between Rouhani and President Barack Obama. To be sure, when it comes to Rouhani's ability to usher real change to Iran's nuclear program, a healthy dose of skepticism is called for. However, his election victory is not the threat that Netanyahu and his cabinet have alleged. In fact, there are good reasons for Israelis to welcome Rouhani's rise to power. Rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation. Among the presidential candidates, he was the most critical of Iran's nuclear-negotiation strategy. His criticism focused on Iran's intransigent posture at the talks, which forced it to pay a disproportionate price for its nuclear program. As Rouhani stated in a campaign video on June 5, 10 days before the election: ""If centrifuges are turning, but the country is dormant, then we don't choose this. If the arrangement is for Natanz [Iran's nuclear enrichment site] to work but 100 other factories close because of sanctions and shortage of primary material or they only work at 20 percent of their capacity, then this is unacceptable.""

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was the most moderate candidate among those allowed to run in the country's June election. Yet within one month of Rouhani's victory, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly called him a ""wolf in sheepÃ¢ÂÂs clothing.""

In what should be good news for Israel, Rouhani could usher in change to Iran's nuclear stance. He enjoys very good relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him. For 25 years Rouhani was Khamenei's representative on the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which shapes Iran's national security and defense policies.



In fact, Rouhani's relations with Khamenei are far better so far than that of his predecessors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Ahmadinejad. Khamenei may not have allowed Ahmadinejad to shift Iran's nuclear strategy, despite the latter's calls for Iran to halt enrichment at 20 percent, because of bad relations between the two leaders after a public falling out in April 2011.

Rouhani's rapprochement with the U.S. could also be good news for Israeli worries over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Improved relations with Iran, along with the leverage of sanctions, could give the U.S. what it needs to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program.



At the same time, Rouhani's rise to power and the strengthening of his position will come at a cost to Iran's hard-liners, Israel's most ardent enemies. In fact, this is already happening: In less than two months since coming to power, Rouhani is already changing parts of Iran's stance on the Holocaust, much to the fury of Iran's ultraconservatives.

Last but not least, Rouhani's election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against Iran, such as the restrictions against Iran's Central Bank that Israel had demanded for many years. A military attack by Israel or the U.S., by contrast, would most probably have stiffened Iran's stance against negotiations. So now that the goal of softening Iran's stance has been achieved, it is time to reap its benefits.

Netanyahu appears to believe that Rouhani cannot be trusted and must be pressured incessantly, even if he offers compromises. Netanyahu insists that Iran's entire nuclear program must be dismantled and, if Iran does not comply, military action should be taken.

The irony in Netanyahu's harsh line is that it helps Rouhani politically. In Iran praise from any Israeli leaders could be detrimental.

For now, Netanyahu appears to be attacking Rouhani because he genuinely doubts his sincerity and views his overtures as a threat to Israel. Let us hope that instead of hurting Rouhani, Netanyahu ends up helping him. Rouhani's diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity Israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear program."	0

CHARLESTON, South Carolina (CNN) -- The eight candidates vying to be the Democrat nominee for president in the 2008 elections answered questions submitted by CNN and YouTube users in a debate Tuesday night. Here is a full transcript of the event:

Eight candidates gathered in South Carolina for a new type of questioning.

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN host: Our first question tonight is Zach Kempf in Provo, Utah.

QUESTION: What's up? I'm running out of tape; I have to hurry.

So my question is: We have a bunch of leaders who can't seem to do their job. And we pick people based on the issues they that they represent, but then they get in power and they don't do anything about it anyway.

You're going to spend this whole night talking about your views on issues, but the issues don't matter if when you get in power nothing's going to get done.

We have a Congress and a president with, like, a 30 percent approval rating, so clearly we don't think they're doing a good job. What's going to make you any more effectual, beyond all the platitudes and the stuff we're used to hearing? I mean, be honest with us. How are you going to be any different?

COOPER: Senator Dodd, you've been in Congress more than 30 years. Can you honestly say you're any different?

SEN. CHRISTOPHER DODD: Well, I think so.

First of all, thank you for inviting us here in The Citadel. It's great to be here at this wonderful college, university.

Certainly, I think it's a very important question one ought to be asking because, while hope and confidence and optimism are clearly very important, I think experience matters a great deal -- the experience people bring to their candidacy, the ideas, the bold ideas that they've championed over the years, whether or not they were successful in advancing those ideas and able to bring people together.

I'm very proud of the fact that, over my 26 years in the Senate, I've authored landmark legislation, the Family and Medical Leave Act, child care legislation, reform of financial institutions.

In every case, those are new ideas, bold ideas, that I campaigned on and then were able to achieve in the United States Senate by bringing Republicans as well as Democrats together around those issues.

That's what's missing, more than anything else, I think, right now, is the ability to bring people together to get the job done.

COOPER: But if someone really wants a change, are you the guy to give it to them?

DODD: Well, I think they ought to look back. Speeches are easy to make and rhetoric is easy to expose here. But I think the idea of looking back and saying, ""What have you done?"" --if you want to get a good idea of where someone is going to lead or how they're going to lead, I think it's very appropriate to say, ""What have you done? Show me. Demonstrate to me the ability to get these things done that you've championed in the past.""

COOPER: Senator Obama, your supporters say you are different. Your critics say you're inexperienced. You're a first-term senator.

SEN. BARACK OBAMA: Well, I think the questioner hit the nail on the head. As I travel around the country, people have an urgent desire for change in Washington. And we are not going to fix health care, we're not going to fix energy, we are not going to do anything about our education system unless we change how business is done in Washington.

Now, part of that is bringing people together, as Chris said. But part of it is also overcoming special interests and lobbyists who are writing legislation that's critical to the American people.

And one of the things I bring is a perspective as a community organizer, as a state legislator, as well as a U.S. senator, that says: Washington has to change.

COOPER: A lot of people say -- Congressman Kucinich, your supporters certainly say you are different. Even your critics would certainly say you are different. Here's a direct question for you.

QUESTION: Hello. My name is Davis Fleetwood. I'm from Groton, Massachusetts. My question is for Dennis Kucinich.

After watching the first several debates, which seemed more like conversations than actually debates, we're all clear out here that you Democrats are united. We get it.

But we have a very important decision to make coming up very soon, and Americans desperate for a change need to know: Congressman Kucinich, how would America be better off with you as president than we would be if either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama became president?

COOPER: What do you have that Senator Clinton and Senator Obama do not have?

REP. DENNIS KUCINICH: Well, first of all, a clear record as having not only opposed the war from the very beginning -- the only one of the stage that actually voted against the war, and also the only one on the stage who voted against funding the war 100 percent of the time.

You know, we're here at The Citadel. I want the people of The Citadel to know that I mourn the passing of those people who gave their lives, but I also would not hesitate to call upon you to defend this country, but I'll never send you in pursuit of a political agenda or a lie.

Just like my father before me, who served in the Marines, and my brother who served in the Marines in Vietnam, and my nephew who served in Iraq, I believed in duty and honor and I think it's important to have those commitments to this country.

And so I say we achieve strength through peace. That's the new doctrine that I'm going to promote throughout this campaign; that we'll use the science of human relations and diplomacy; that we pursue an approach which says that you can use international agreements and treaties; and that you can work to settle your differences without committing the young men and women to war, unless it's absolutely necessary.

COOPER: Senator Clinton, you were involved in that question. I want to give you a chance to respond, 30 seconds.

(APPLAUSE)

SEN. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I think the Democrats are united, as Davis said, and we are united for change. We cannot take another four or eight years of Republican leadership that has been so disastrous for our country.

The issue is: Which of us is ready to lead on day one? I have 35 years of being an instrument and agent of change, before I was ever a public official. And during the time that I've been privileged to serve as first lady and now as senator, I've worked to bring people together, to find common ground where we can, and then to stand our ground where we can't.

COOPER: Senator Obama, you were involved in that question as well.

OBAMA: Look, I don't think this is just a Republican problem. I think this is a problem that spans the parties. And we don't just need a change in political parties in Washington. We've got to have a change in attitudes of those who are representing the people, America. And part of the reason I don't take PAC money, I don't take federal lobbyists' money is because we've got to get the national interests up front as opposed to the special interests.

And that is something that I've got a track record doing, and I think that is what the American people are looking for in this election -- people of both parties as well as independents.

COOPER: Our next question is for Senator Clinton.

(APPLAUSE)

QUESTION: Hi. My name is Rob Porter, and I'm from Irvine, California.

I have a question for Hillary Clinton.

Mrs. Clinton, how would you define the word ""liberal?""

And would you use this word to describe yourself?

Thank you.

(LAUGHTER)

CLINTON: You know, it is a word that originally meant that you were for freedom, that you were for the freedom to achieve, that you were willing to stand against big power and on behalf of the individual.

Unfortunately, in the last 30, 40 years, it has been turned up on its head and it's been made to seem as though it is a word that describes big government, totally contrary to what its meaning was in the 19th and early 20th century.

I prefer the word ""progressive,"" which has a real American meaning, going back to the progressive era at the beginning of the 20th century.

I consider myself a modern progressive, someone who believes strongly in individual rights and freedoms, who believes that we are better as a society when we're working together and when we find ways to help those who may not have all the advantages in life get the tools they need to lead a more productive life for themselves and their family.

So I consider myself a proud modern American progressive, and I think that's the kind of philosophy and practice that we need to bring back to American politics.

COOPER: So you wouldn't use the word ""liberal,"" you'd say ""progressive.""

(APPLAUSE)

Senator Gravel, are you a liberal?

FORMER SEN. MIKE GRAVEL: I wouldn't use either word (OFF-MIKE) Zach asked about change. You're not going to see any change when these people get elected.

We were asked about -- that we're united.

We're not united. I'm not united on many of their views. And I want to take on Barack Obama for a minute, who said he doesn't take money from lobbyists. Well, he has 134 bundlers. Now, what does he think that is?

And, besides that, he has received money from a Robert Wolf, the head of the USB (sic) bank in the United States, who raised $195,000 -- from this bank -- wait a second -- who has lobbyists in Washington...

COOPER: Your time is up.

GRAVEL: ... and it's a foreign-owned bank.

COOPER: Senator Obama, I'm going to have to let you respond.

OBAMA: Absolutely.

Well, the fact is I don't take PAC money and I don't take lobbyists' money.

And the bundlers -- the reason you know who is raising money for me, Mike, is because I have pushed through a law this past session to disclose that.

And that's the kind of leadership that I've shown in the Senate. That's the kind of leadership that I showed when I was a state legislator. And that's the kind of leadership that I'll show as president of the United States.

GRAVEL: Wait a minute...

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Our next question is for Senator Biden.

QUESTION: Hello. This question is for all of the candidates. Partisanship played a major role in why nothing can be done in Washington today. All of you say you will be able to work with Republicans. Well, here's a test. If you had to pick any Republican member of Congress or Republican governor to be your running mate, who would it be?

SEN. JOE BIDEN: At the risk of hurting his reputation -- and it will hurt him -- but I would pick Chuck Hagel, and I'd consider asking Dick Lugar to be secretary of state.

And I do have -- I do have a record of significant accomplishment. The crime bill, which became known as the Clinton crime bill, was written by Joe Biden, the Biden crime bill. That required me to cross over, get everyone together, not -- no one's civil liberties were in any way jeopardized.

We put 100,000 cops on the street. Violent crime came down.

The Violence against Women Act, what we did in Bosnia, and so on. So I have a track record of being able to cross over and get things done.

And by the way, if you want to end all this money, support my effort to pass public financing of all elections.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: All right. Stay on the topic.

Senator Edwards? Any Republicans?

FORMER SEN. JOHN EDWARDS: Actually, I think Chuck Hagel is a good choice. But I -- if you listen to these questions, they all have exactly the same thing, which is how do we bring about big change?

And I think that's a fundamental threshold question. And the question is: Do you believe that compromise, triangulation will bring about big change? I don't.

I think the people who are powerful in Washington -- big insurance companies, big drug companies, big oil companies -- they are not going to negotiate. They are not going to give away their power. The only way that they are going to give away their power is if we take it away from them.

(APPLAUSE)

And I have been standing up to these people my entire life. I have been fighting them my entire life in court rooms -- and beating them.

If you want real change, you need somebody who's taking these people on and beating them...

COOPER: Time.

EDWARDS: ... over and over and over.

COOPER: The other thing you're going to see tonight are candidate videos. We've asked each campaign to put together a 30- second YouTube-style video. The first one is from Senator Chris Dodd.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

QUESTION: Senator, I have to ask, what's with the white hair?

DODD: I don't know why you bring that up. Bill Richardson, Hillary, Joe Biden and I, we're all about the same age. I don't think the white hair is an issue.

QUESTION: Well, how did you get the white hair?

DODD: Hard work, I suppose. For example, it took me seven years to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act, and I helped to end wars in Central America and bring peace to Northern Ireland. I'm ready to be president.

QUESTION: Well, how many white hairs do you have?

DODD: Hundreds, thousands, I presume.

QUESTION: Really?

DODD: I'm Chris Dodd, and we approved this message.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: There you go. Nothing wrong with white hair.

DODD: A young person with white hair, too?

COOPER: Yes, sadly, my age is catching up to my hair.

(LAUGHTER)

Almost 50 percent of South Carolina's Democrats are African- Americans. It's among the highest percentage of the nation. So we're giving a lot of questions from YouTube viewers on race tonight.

This first one is for Senator Edwards. Let's listen.

QUESTION: Hello, America. Hello, presidential candidates. This is Will from Boston, Massachusetts. And I hope, you know, they put this question on. It's a question in the back of everybody's head. You know, in some people, it's further back than others, collecting cobwebs.

But is African-Americans ever going to get reparations for slavery?

I know you all are going to run around this question, dipping and dodging, so let's see how far you all can get.

COOPER: Senator Edwards, no dipping and dodging. Should African-Americans get reparations?

EDWARDS: I'm not for reparations. I can answer that questions. But I think there are other things we can do to create some equality that doesn't exist in this country today.

Today there was a report that, right here in Charleston, African Americans are paying more than their white counterparts for mortgages than any other place in America, any other place in the United States of America.

And here's an example. What is the conceivable explanation for this, that black people are paying more for their mortgage?

And, by the way, it's not just low-income African Americans; it's high-income African-Americans. There's absolutely no explanation for this. It goes to the basic question that I raised just a few minutes ago.

To have a president that's going to -- is going to fight for equality, fight for real change, big change, bold change, we're going to have to somebody -- we can't trade our insiders for their insiders. That doesn't work.

What we need is somebody who will take these people on, these big banks, these mortgage companies, big insurance companies, big drug companies. That's the only way we're going to bring about change. And I will do that as president.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Obama, your position on reparations?

OBAMA: I think the reparations we need right here in South Carolina is investment, for example, in our schools. I did a...

(APPLAUSE)

I did a town hall meeting in Florence, South Carolina, in an area called the corridor of shame. They've got buildings that students are trying to learn in that were built right after the Civil War. And we've got teachers who are not trained to teach the subjects they're teaching and high dropout rates.

We've got to understand that there are corridors of shame all across the country. And if we make the investments and understand that those are our children, that's the kind of reparations that are really going to make a difference in America right now.

COOPER: Is anyone on the stage for reparations for slavery for African-Americans?

Are you?

KUCINICH: I am.

The Bible says we shall be and must be repairers of the breach. And a breach has occurred.

We have to acknowledge that. It's a breach that has resulted in inequality in opportunities for education, for health care, for housing, for employment. And so, we must be mindful of that.

But it's also a breach that has affected a lot of poor whites as well.

We need to have a country which recognizes that there is an inequality of opportunity and a president who's ready to challenge the interest groups -- be they insurance companies or mortgage companies or defense contractors who are taking the money away from the people who need it.

COOPER: Time.

KUCINICH: Yes, I am for repairing the breach. Yes, I am for reparations.

COOPER: Our next question is for Senator Dodd.

QUESTION: Do you believe the response in the wake of Hurricane Katrina would have been different if the storm hit an affluent, predominantly white city? What roles do you believe race and class played in the storm's aftermath? And if you acknowledge that race and class affected the response efforts, what can you do to ensure that this won't happen in the future? And what can you do to ensure this nation's most needy people, in times of crisis and always, something will be done to help them too?

DODD: Well, it's a great question, Morgan, to raise here. It, obviously, points to one of the most dark and shameful moments in recent past history in our country -- the fact that a major American city went through a natural disaster, and we found almost (ph) little to do. The American president had almost no response whatsoever to the people of that city, New Orleans.

In fact, today still, the problem persists where people who had to move out of their city, move elsewhere, and little or no efforts to make sure they can get back in their homes. They have literally thousands of people whose homes were destroyed, their economic opportunities destroyed.

I believe that had this occurred in a place with mainly a white population, we would have seen a much more rapid response and a consistent response to that issue.

As an American president, we can never, ever allow again a major city, a major population center in our country go through what New Orleans, what the Gulf states did as a result of the kind of neglect from an American president.

As president, I would commit to do everything possible we bring to bear the talents, the resources.

In fact, it should have been done ahead of time, to have a FEMA operation that was prepared to respond to these predictable disasters. So it's a mark of shame on our country. It ought to be reversed. It will in the Dodd administration.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Governor Richardson, the Democrats talk a lot about the failure of the president with Hurricane Katrina. The governor of that state was a Democrat; the mayor of that city is a Democrat as well.

GOV. BILL RICHARDSON: Well, there was politics. All of a sudden, other states that had the similar devastation got better treatment, like Mississippi.

This is what I would do. The response of our government to Katrina, before, during and after, was inexcusable. We have got to eliminate in the future any red tape that helps families -- that helps the devastation.

Secondly, we have to let those that live there to come back first, instead of big moneyed interests. We have to stop the predatory lending of insurance companies, housing and many others that are ripping off the people.

And then, finally, we have to make sure that a president cares -- and doesn't just pose for photo ops, but makes a difference and a commitment to rebuild that city and that region.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Our next question comes from Jordan Williams.

QUESTION: Hello. My name is Jordan Williams, and I am a student at K.U., from Coffeyville, Kansas.

This question is meant for Senator Obama and Senator Clinton.

Whenever I read an editorial about one of you, the author never fails to mention the issue of race or gender, respectively. Either one is not authentically black enough, or the other is not satisfactorily feminine.

How will you address these critics and their charges if one or both of you should end up on the Democratic ticket in '08?

COOPER: Senator Obama, how do you address those who say you're not authentically black enough?

(LAUGHTER)

OBAMA: Well...

COOPER: Not my question; Jordan's question.

OBAMA: You know, when I'm catching a cab in Manhattan -- in the past, I think I've given my credentials.

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

But let me go to the broader issue here. And that is that race permeates our society. It is still a critical problem.

But I do believe in the core decency of the American people, and I think they want to get beyond some of our racial divisions.

Unfortunately, we've had a White House that hasn't invested in the kinds of steps that have to be done to overcome the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow in this country.

And as president of the United States, my commitment on issues like education, my commitment on issues like health care is to close the disparities and the gaps, because that's what's really going to solve the race problem in this country.

If people feel like they've got a fair shake, if children feel as if the fact that they have a different surname or they've got a different skin color is not going to impede their dreams, then I am absolutely confident that we're going to be able to move forward on the challenges that we face as a country.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Clinton, you have a minute as well since this question is to you.

CLINTON: Well, I couldn't run as anything other than a woman.

(LAUGHTER)

I am proud to be running as a woman.

And I'm excited that I may...

(APPLAUSE)

... you know, may be able, finally, to break that hardest of all glass ceilings.

But, obviously, I'm not running because I'm a woman. I'm running because I think I'm the most qualified and experienced person to hit the ground running in January 2009.

And I trust the American people to make a decision that is not about me or my gender, or about Barack or his race or about Bill and his ethnicity, but about what is best for you and your family.

We have big challenges...

(APPLAUSE)

... and big needs in our country. And I think we're going to need experienced and strong leadership in order to start handling all of the problems that we have here at home and around the world.

And when I'm inaugurated, I think it's going to send a great message to a lot of little girls and boys around the world.

COOPER: Senator Edwards...

(APPLAUSE)

Senator Edwards, earlier this week, your wife said that you would be a better advocate for women than Senator Clinton. Was she right?

EDWARDS: Well, let me say first that on the question that was just asked to Senator Obama...

COOPER: We prefer you stay on the question...

EDWARDS: I'm going to stay on your question. I promise I'll answer that question. But the first thing I want to say -- and I want to speak for everybody, I believe, on this stage -- anybody who's considering not voting for Senator Obama because he's black or for Senator Clinton because she's a woman, I don't want their vote. I don't want them voting for me.

(APPLAUSE)

I think what Elizabeth was saying was -- to answer your question, what Elizabeth was saying was there are very important issues facing women in this country. More women are affected by the minimum wage than men are affected by the minimum wage. I have been the most aggressive -- in fact, I would challenge every Democrat on this stage today to commit to raising the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour by the year 2012.

(APPLAUSE)

Second, there are more women in poverty than men in poverty.

And I have made this a central cause in my life and a central cause in my campaign. More women have difficulty getting the health care that they need than men do. And I was the first person to come out with a comprehensive, truly universal health care plan.

COOPER: So do you think you're a better advocate for women than Senator Clinton?

EDWARDS: Those are issues -- listen, Senator Clinton has a long history of speaking out on behalf of women. She deserves to be commended for that. But I believe that on the issues that directly affect women's lives, I have the strongest, boldest ideas and can bring about the change that needs to be brought.

COOPER: Senator Clinton, is he a better advocate for women?

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Anderson, I have a great deal of admiration for Elizabeth Edwards. And I appreciate greatly John's comments. You know, I have spent my entire life advocating for women. I went to Beijing in 1995 and said that women's rights are human rights, and I've done everything I can to make that principle come true.

And, specifically on issues, I got to vote to raise the minimum wage.

I put in legislation which said that Congress should not get a salary increase until they did raise the minimum wage, and I am putting that back in, because I agree that by the time we got it raised after 10 years, it was already out of date.

And as to women in poverty and women with health care needs, I have been on the forefront of both advocating and creating change in my public service, in my time in Arkansas, the White House, and now in the Senate.

But I think it is terrific. We're up here arguing about who's going to be better for women, because isn't that a nice change for everybody to hear.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Our next question is on a topic that got a lot of response from YouTube viewers. Let's watch.

QUESTION: Hi. My name is Mary.

QUESTION: And my name is Jen.

QUESTION: And we're from Brooklyn, New York.

If you were elected president of the United States, would you allow us to be married to each other?

COOPER: Congressman Kucinich?

KUCINICH: Mary and Jen, the answer to your question is yes. And let me tell you why.

Because if our Constitution really means what it says, that all are created equal, if it really means what it says, that there should be equality of opportunity before the law, then our brothers and sisters who happen to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender should have the same rights accorded to them as anyone else, and that includes the ability to have a civil marriage ceremony.

Yes, I support you. And welcome to a better and a new America under a President Kucinich administration.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Dodd, you supported the Defense of Marriage Act. What's your position?

DODD: I've made the case, Anderson, that -- my wife and I have two young daughters, age 5 and 2.

I'd simply ask the audience to ask themselves the question that Jackie and I have asked: How would I want my two daughters treated if they grew up and had a different sexual orientation than their parents?

Good jobs, equal opportunity, to be able to retire, to visit each other, to be with each other, as other people do.

So I feel very strongly, if you ask yourself the question, ""How would you like your children treated if they had a different sexual orientation than their parents?,"" the answer is yes. They ought to have that ability in civil unions.

I don't go so far as to call for marriage. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.

But my state of Connecticut, the state of New Hampshire, have endorsed civil unions. I strongly support that. But I don't go so far as marriage.

COOPER: Governor Richardson?

RICHARDSON: Well, I would say to the two young women, I would level with you -- I would do what is achievable.

What I think is achievable is full civil unions with full marriage rights. I would also press for you a hate crimes act in the Congress. I would eliminate ""don't ask/don't tell"" in the military.

(APPLAUSE)

If we're going to have in our military men and women that die for this country, we shouldn't give them a lecture on their sexual orientation

I would push for domestic partnership laws, nondiscrimination in insurance and housing.

I would also send a very strong message that, in my administration, I will not tolerate any discrimination on the basis of race, gender, or sexual orientation.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: This next question is for Senator Edwards.

QUESTION: I'm Reverend Reggie Longcrier. I'm the pastor of Exodus Mission and Outreach Church in Hickory, North Carolina.

Senator Edwards said his opposition to gay marriage is influenced by his Southern Baptist background. Most Americans agree it was wrong and unconstitutional to use religion to justify slavery, segregation, and denying women the right to vote.

So why is it still acceptable to use religion to deny gay American their full and equal rights?

(APPLAUSE)

EDWARDS: I think Reverend Longcrier asks a very important question, which is whether fundamentally -- whether it's right for any of our faith beliefs to be imposed on the American people when we're president of the United States. I do not believe that's right.

I feel enormous personal conflict about this issue. I want to end discrimination. I want to do some of the things that I just heard Bill Richardson talking about -- standing up for equal rights, substantive rights, civil unions, the thing that Chris Dodd just talked about. But I think that's something everybody on this stage will commit themselves to as president of the United States.

But I personally have been on a journey on this issue. I feel enormous conflict about it. As I think a lot of people know, Elizabeth spoke -- my wife Elizabeth spoke out a few weeks ago, and she actually supports gay marriage. I do not. But this is a very, very difficult issue for me. And I recognize and have enormous respect for people who have a different view of it.

COOPER: I should also point out that the reverend is actually in the audience tonight. Where is he? Right over here.

Reverend, do you feel he answered your question?

(APPLAUSE)

QUESTION: This question was just a catalyst that promoted some other things that wrapped around that particular question, especially when it comes to fair housing practices. Also...

COOPER: Do you think he answered the question, though?

QUESTION: Not like I would like to have heard it...

(LAUGHTER)

COOPER: What did you not hear?

QUESTION: I didn't quite get -- some people were moving around, and I didn't quite get all of his answer. I just heard...

COOPER: All right, there's 30 seconds more. Why is it OK to quite religious beliefs when talking about why you don't support something? That's essentially what's his question.

EDWARDS: It's not. I mean, I've been asked a personal question which is, I think, what Reverend Longcrier is raising, and that personal question is, do I believe and do I personally support gay marriage?

The honest answer to that is I don't. But I think it is absolutely wrong, as president of the United States, for me to have used that faith basis as a basis for denying anybody their rights, and I will not do that when I'm president of the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Obama, the laws banning interracial marriage in the United States were ruled unconstitutional in 1967. What is the difference between a ban on interracial marriage and a ban on gay marriage?

OBAMA: Well, I think that it is important to pick up on something that was said earlier by both Dennis and by Bill, and that is that we've got to make sure that everybody is equal under the law. And the civil unions that I proposed would be equivalent in terms of making sure that all the rights that are conferred by the state are equal for same-sex couples as well as for heterosexual couples.

Now, with respect to marriage, it's my belief that it's up to the individual denominations to make a decision as to whether they want to recognize marriage or not. But in terms of, you know, the rights of people to transfer property, to have hospital visitation, all those critical civil rights that are conferred by our government, those should be equal.

COOPER: We're going to take a quick break, but before we go we're going to show another candidate video. This one is from the Clinton campaign. And then when we come back from the break, we'll see one from the -- from Senator Edwards' campaign.

(MUSIC PLAYED FROM CLINTON CAMPAIGN VIDEO)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(MUSIC PLAYED FROM EDWARDS CAMPAIGN VIDEO)

COOPER: That was just one of the candidates' videos. If you're just joining us, that's one of the candidate videos you're going to be seeing throughout the evening as we go to commercial breaks.

Let's turn international now. We've got a lot of international questions. Let's listen.

QUESTION:"	0
317	"In his press conference on March 11, 2011, President Barack Obama talked up U.S. oil production against a backdrop of rising prices at the pump.



""We need to continue to boost domestic production of oil and gas,"" he said. ""Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt match up with reality,""



In this item, weÃ¢ÂÂll check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasnÃ¢ÂÂt ""shut down"" oil production -- that ""last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003.""



We turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal governmentÃ¢ÂÂs official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said ""oil production,"" we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products.



Here are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003:



2003: 2,073,453,000

2004: 1,983,302,000

2005: 1,890,106,000

2006: 1,862,259,000

2007: 1,848,450,000

2008: 1,811,817,000

2009: 1,956,596,000

2010: 2,011,856,000



So, 2010 is definitely the highest since 2003. But weÃ¢ÂÂll note a couple of caveats.



First, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing 2009 and 2010 statistics, petroleum production only rose about 3 percent. And the level for 2010 is only 11 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic.



The second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years.



Domestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by 110,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by an additional 130,000 barrels per day in 2012. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower 48 states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling.



So Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003, but weÃ¢ÂÂre taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True."	0

319	"'This Week' Transcript: McKay, Napolitano, Salazar and Allen

Transcript: ""This Week"" with Lamar McKay McKay, Janet Napolitano, Ken Salazar and Thad Allen

TAPPER: Good morning. We'll get to our main story on the oil spill in a moment, but first a breaking news from overnight. A car bomb discovered in New York's Times Square. Police cleared thousands of people from the streets after finding an SUV loaded with propane tanks, gasoline, black powder and a timing device, the makings of what appeared to be a crude car bomb. The situation is now safe, but joining me this morning is Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. And Secretary Napolitano, I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions about this.

First of all, I know that the federal government is treating this as a potential terrorist attack and that you have some evidence, you're dusting for fingerprints. But this attempted attack resembles car bomb attempts in London and Scotland in 2007. How concerned are you that this is not an isolated incident?

NAPOLITANO: Well, right now, we have no evidence that it is anything other than a one-off, but we are alerting state, local officials around the country, letting them know what is going on. The forensics are being done. As leads evolve or develop, they will all be tracked down. This is getting attention. FBI, Department of Homeland Security, New York City police, everybody is on it.

TAPPER: I got to think that Times Square is one of the most surveilled areas in the entire world. How close are we to finding a suspect?

NAPOLITANO: Well, right now, it is heavily surveilled, and as you know, there are cameras all over, and so tape is being reviewed. But traditional forensics are being done in addition to that. Looking for fingerprints, tracking down the vehicle, the license plate number, looking at the timer -- the (inaudible) of the explosive device. Right now it doesn't look like it's all a very sophisticated one, quite frankly, but looking into that. So there is a lot of work that's being done, and then of course other intel being developed, and that will evolve as the day goes on.

TAPPER: How concerned should the American people be?

NAPOLITANO: Well, Times Square I think is now safe, and I believe that right now, we have no information other than it is a one-off. But nonetheless, we are alerting state and local law enforcement, everybody to be on their toes.

TAPPER: OK, great. We'll come back to you and other Obama administration officials in a second. Right now, we're going to turn to our main interview, and that is the President Obama is heading down to the Gulf Coast this morning for his own assessment of the oil spill, a massive slick almost the size of Connecticut. It's making its way to the Louisiana coast, threatening wild life, the environment and the economic livelihood of residents there. Meanwhile, efforts to plug the gush almost a mile below the surface have failed.

Joining me now for an exclusive interview is Lamar McKay, chairman and president of BP America, which owned the well and was leasing the rig that blew up. He joins us from company headquarters in Houston. Mr. McKay, thanks for joining us, and first of all, our condolences to the families of the workers who lost their lives.

MCKAY: Thank you, Jake, and thank you for the opportunity to be here today. This has been a tragic event. As you mentioned, we had 11 people lose their lives. We've had people seriously injured, and we've got an event of enormous proportion that we're dealing with.

TAPPER: OK, BP's plans to stop this leak include an underwater dome that you're trying to build to contain the leak, and a whole other rig to drill a relief well, what is the latest on the situation? The relief well could take up to three months to drill. Where are we in this process?

MCKAY: Jake, let me explain for your viewers exactly what's going on. We've got effectively three fronts of attack that we are aggressively pursuing in partnership with the government. One is effectively stopping the source, stopping the well from flowing. The second one is as -- and these are in parallel -- is to work a containment system, a collection system sub-sea to be able to effectively channel the flow up a pipe and into a processing system that we can control at the surface. Then the third is dealing aggressively, aggressively with the spill offshore and trying to fight that spill offshore, and the fourth is to deal with the -- deal with the, if the oil touches the shore, to deal with the cleanup and deal with the impacts on shore. Those are sorts of the fronts that are under way.

You mentioned the containment system. We call it the containment dome. That has been fabricated. The engineering is being finalized to get that mobilized and deployed. That will probably be in six to eight days, we'll have that deployed.

Meanwhile, just so you know, we're still working hard, still working hard on the blowout preventer and see if we can actuate this piece of evidently failed equipment. And as you can imagine, this is like doing open-heart surgery at 5,000 feet, with -- in the dark, with robot-controlled submarines.

TAPPER: The government says currently 5,000 barrels of oil a day are spilling into the gulf. Some experts say it might be five times that, 25,000 barrels of oil a day. How much oil do you think is spilling into the gulf?

MCKAY: Well, the estimates of how much oil is coming out are very difficult because you can't measure in any way accurately, so effectively what we're doing with the help of NOAA and the rest of the government agencies is understand that volume that is inferred essentially by surface expression on the top of the water. So I don't know the volume. The volume uncertainty -- there is a large uncertainty range around the 5,000 barrels.

Our spill response is designed to take that uncertainty into account, and we're responding for that full range of uncertainty with all the resources that we can, in conjunction with the government.

TAPPER: Obama administration officials have expressed in recent days concerns that BP is not doing enough. Other officials have said that you don't have the resources. Should the government take over this operation?

MCKAY: I think we're, as we said from day one, we're throwing every resource that we've got at this, and this is now an industry effort. It's not just a BP effort. It's an effort in conjunction with the government. And I think the partnership that we've got between industry and the government has rallied an effort that is unprecedented in size, and I think that that effort is actually working pretty well. It will continue to be flexed and expanded where it needs to, and I think, you know, the point here is we are doing everything possible that we know of -- and I believe I'm talking about the collective we here -- to control the source first. That's our first priority. While in parallel, fighting the thing offshore as far as -- as far as possible and as effectively as possible, and then dealing with the cleanup and issues and impacts on shore should they occur.

TAPPER: Your company, BP, has a spotty safety record, most horrifically in 2005, an explosion at a refinery in Texas that killed 15 workers; other incidents involving leaks have been blamed on cutting corners on financial reasons. How confident are you that this accident had nothing to do with cutting back on safety to save a buck?

MCKAY: Well, the investigations are going to show the cause of this accident, and we want those investigations to be done. My belief that is that that does not have anything to do with it. I believe we've got a failed piece of equipment. We don't know why it failed yet in this contracted rig, and BOP system will figure that out.

But let me just tell you, our focus, our focus right now is dealing with the source of the oil, dealing with it on the surface, and dealing with it on the beach or the marsh if it occurs.

TAPPER: Your initial filing to the government, to the Mineral Management Service for 2009 before you drilled on this spot made this assessment, quote, ""An accidental oil spill could cause impact to the beaches. However, due to the distance to shore, 48 miles, and the response capabilities that would be implemented, no significant adverse impacts are expected. BP Exploration and Production Incorporated has the capability to respond to the maximum extent practicable to a worst-case discharge,"" which you estimated at 300,000 gallons. It's less than that, it's estimated to be 210,000, and yet BP does not seem to have the capability to respond. How can the public trust BP's assessments of risk and how can the public trust anything you guys say?

MCKAY: Well, I think we are responding very, very aggressively. As you may know, we had a response planned, filed for the drilling of this well that incorporates various capability around the Gulf Coast. That spill response plan was activated as soon as this event occurred. It has been extremely aggressive. It will continue to be extremely aggressive, and I believe the response -- this is, you know, we must understand, this is -- this is a very low likelihood but very high impact response -- sorry, incident -- and the response is matching that incident.

TAPPER: I just have a couple more questions. Just a few months ago, a BP executive protested proposed new safety regulations for oil rigs, writing to the government that quote, ""while BP is supportive of companies having a system in place to reduce risks, accidents, injuries and spills, we are not supportive of extensive proscriptive regulations."" Will BP continue to fight and lobby against safety regulations?

MCKAY: Well, I would characterize the letter you're talking about slightly differently. That letter was in response to the government's request for input on safety regulations that the MMS was looking at. The rest of the letter actually recommends improvements and specific recommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change them. So we're not fighting anything about safety. Safety is the number one priority. We're going to figure out what happened here, and that is going to help the MMS and help ourselves and help the industry get safer, so we're not fighting anything about safety.

TAPPER: All right, last question, Mr. McKay. You had several fail/safe mechanisms on this rig, and they all failed. Since you don't yet know what caused this accident, will you stop all operations until you know? How can the American people trust that there won't be another explosion at another BP facility?

MCKAY: Well, we're working in conjunction with the government on understanding everything we can understand as quickly as we can. We're not going to do anything that we think is unsafe. We're doing extra tests on various pieces of equipment to make absolutely sure they will work in the condition they're intended to work in.

We won't do any work if we don't think it can be carried out safely and without impact. But we are working very closely with the government in trying to understand this and see if there should be any changes quickly.

TAPPER: All right. Lamar McKay, thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate your time.

MCKAY: Thank you.

TAPPER: And we're now joined by a powerhouse roundtable. As always, George Will, from the National Action Network, the Reverend Al Sharpton, from HBO's ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" Bill Maher, former Bush adviser Matthew Dowd, and Katrina vanden Heuvel from The Nation.

Thanks, one and all.

George, I've heard some conservative critics say that this oil slick is President Obama's Katrina. Is it?

WILL: No. It might come as a news bulletin to the president himself, but he's not responsible for everything, and bad things happen. This is a reality check for a nation that's ravenous for energy and has to be and always has been. Getting our sources of energy has risks.

The Exxon Valdez called our attention to the fact that it's very dangerous shipping oil across the surface of the ocean. Since the Exxon Valdez, there have been seven larger tanker spills. You can go up to West Virginia, where 29 miners are being mourned today, and they will tell you about the risks of mining coal. No one says stop mining coal because of this.

TAPPER: Reverend, some critics -- not just from the right -- are saying that the Obama administration was slow. The New York Times editorial board faulted the Obama administration. Is that unfair criticism?

SHARPTON: Well, I think so. I think that when you look at the fact that, first of all, this has been an evolving crisis -- this did not happen -- unlike Katrina, where you had a natural disaster that immediately blanketed the whole area and we were watching it live on television, this got worse over time.

And I think that there's evidence that the White House has put out -- I've not talked to them, but I've read this on their Web site -- of how they met each rising crisis with personnel there, cabinet members there, now the president going, unlike George Bush, that said he didn't see the crisis, and we sat there four or five days and watched it live on television. So I think any analogy is absolutely ridiculous.

TAPPER: Bill, I was watching your show Friday night...

MAHER: Morning.

TAPPER: ... and you said, in language more suitable for premium cable...

MAHER: I promise I won't here. They're so nervous about that.

TAPPER: ... that you're surprised President Obama isn't getting more, shall we say, guff for...

MAHER: Exactly.

TAPPER: ... for this crisis.

MAHER: Yes, I think he should. You know, he owns this issue now, because it was only a few weeks ago that he came out for offshore drilling. And I would say philosophically this is -- you know, the problem, I think, a lot of people on the left have with this country and have for many years, is that there's no one who really represents our point of view.

There's two parties who want to fight the war on terror with an army in Afghanistan. There's two parties who want to drill offshore. Where is the other side on this?

So, you know, I could certainly criticize oil companies, and I could criticize America in general for not attacking this problem in the '70s. I mean, Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years. We certainly could have.

But it is very disappointing, I think, for this president to be taking a position, as he had -- and I guess he's backpedaling now on it, I hope. I mean, I hope there's a flip-flop I can believe in there. But...

TAPPER: There's a slogan for you, flip-flops I can believe in.

MAHER: I could believe in that one, and I hope he does.

TAPPER: Matt, where's the public on this issue?

DOWD: Well, I think the public -- I mean, first of all, the public doesn't think there's any equal nature to Katrina and this. I mean, Katrina, obviously, evacuated -- having to evacuate an entire area and what that issue was, was such a different issue than this.

But I think where the public is on this, if you put this in the context of what happened in West Virginia and the mine disaster and this in context of Katrina, even though it was different, and this in context in many things, I think the public sits there and says, ""Who's in charge? Who is accountable, and who can -- what governmental entity can actually be effective in doing anything?""

And I think that ultimately is where the public is. It's just another example of a fact that we cannot trust the government to do anything that we need them to do, from mines to even a belief (ph) on health care to -- to the oil spill. It's a loss of faith, I think, again, in the government.

VANDEN HEUVEL: What we've seen are the risks are too great. Offshore drilling is the problem, not the solution. This is not Katrina, 1,500 dead, hundreds of thousands homeless.

I think more important is to understand that we now need a government that is going to regulate a company, BP, which was a serial abuser of workers and of safety regulations. Just like Massey, we need regulations...

TAPPER: Massey, with the -- with the West Virginia mine.

VANDEN HEUVEL: ... tough enforcement -- the mines -- we need a government that understands that. I would also point out that this was the week that for the first time an offshore wind farm was approved. And George Will may not see a future in that, but I believe we need a Manhattan Project, an Apollo Alliance to ramp up public and private investment.

At the moment, energy companies spend 0.25 percent on R&D. We can do better. We are a nation which should do better, George, and not rely on dirty energy, which just compounds the problem affecting this country and the planet.

TAPPER: Mr. Will, your name has been invoked.

WILL: Well, one in five steps of an approval process has now been taken for the wind farm, vigorously opposed by people who are all in favor of renewable energy elsewhere, because they think it'll spoil their view.

TAPPER: This is the wind farm off the coast of Massachusetts that a lot of people...

WILL: The wind farm on Cape Cod, yes.

TAPPER: ... including the Kennedy family, were fighting tooth and nail.

WILL: Right. And -- and, by the way, wind farms kill a lot more birds daily than are probably going to be killed in this oil spill.

And so -- but I'd like to go back to Bill. Could you just explain to me in what sense Brazil got off oil?

MAHER: I believe they did. I believe they, in the '70s, they had a program to use sugarcane ethanol. And I believe that is what fuels their country.

WILL: I think they still burn a lot of oil and have a lot of it offshore.

VANDEN HEUVEL: But, George, you're a man who understands there are always alternatives in politics and in science. We can -- you know, why should we be relying on what we are now seeing the risks of?

And, by the way, we can do better with existing oil fields. We can get as much from existing oil fields, which the oil companies for profit reasons aren't doing much with. So I just think we have seen the risks and we need to take action. It is just too much to look at what is going on in the gulf and what will happen if it moves into the Arctic.

And I agree with Bill. I think President Obama was pandering when he moved to this offshore drilling stance. But I think this White House has the ability, unlike previous White Houses, to understand and see the light and take a different step.

MAHER: And could we have judges fact-check this on Brazil? I don't know...

(CROSSTALK)

MAHER: ... dreamed that about Brazil.

(CROSSTALK)

MAHER: ... and Brazil, let's get back to the United States. I think that Katrina's right. I think that there's a challenge here. And I think that the president and the country has to deal with the reality that we're facing.

And I think that the reality is that usually it's not about who's going to speak for the left or right. It's, who's going to be right on these issues? We see what can happen here. Now what do we do about it? And I think that, clearly, a failure to stand up and lead at this point is something that all of us would criticize.

But I'm not convinced that this president won't. I think he's going down there, he's going to reassess. And I think that we've got to see where that goes and if he goes, right, support him, and I think he will.

But I think to act like this is Katrina, I think this is the step without -- beyond the realm of a sane discussion.

TAPPER: OK. We're going to take a quick break and come back, and the roundtable will discuss the far less controversial issue -- that's sarcastic -- about immigration law and Florida Governor Charlie Crist's declaration of independence. And later, of course, the Sunday funnies.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

COLBERT: There is an impending environmental disaster looming right off our nation's fragile coastline. I'm speaking, of course, about the new wind farm off of Cape Cod. What if it breaks and we have a catastrophic wind spill?

(UNKNOWN): And if the feds won't come in and protect us, then we will come forward and protect ourselves. We -- we have no other choice. We have -- we have a right, Greta, to feel free in our state and to feel safe. And with what's going on, we have many, many people that feel that they are not safe.

(UNKNOWN): Si se puede! Si se puede! Si se puede!

OBAMA: If you are a Hispanic American in Arizona, if you don't have your papers and you took your kid out to get ice cream, you're going to be harassed, that's something that could potentially happen, that's not the right way to go.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TAPPER: And we're back with our roundtable. As always, George Will, the Reverend Al Sharpton from the National Action Network, the host of HBO's ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" Bill Maher, Matthew Dowd, former Bush adviser, and Katrina vanden Heuvel of The Nation.

Reverend Sharpton, I want to start with you. You're going to be participating in leading a march and a rally and a vigil in Arizona on Wednesday to protest this immigration reform law. What do you think the citizens of Arizona should do with the fact that there is this big illegal immigration problem?

SHARPTON: Well, first of all, I think we need to have real immigration reform from a federal level. The federal government is supposed to set immigration policy, and I think that all of our forces ought to really try to put the pressure there, which is something all of us advocated doing the last two general elections.

To try and now say that because that has not happened -- and all of us agree it should -- that we're now going to have state law and open the door to racial profiling is what we're objecting to and protesting on Wednesday and have said since the law was signed Friday before last.

And this, unlike many of the critics of those of us that protest this, this is not about protecting illegal immigrants. This is about protecting legal citizens. If you are Hispanic or thought to be Hispanic in the state of Arizona, you can be faced (ph) and subjected to an harassment that other citizens should not. That's a violation of equal protection under the law.

We would not tolerate that to people that look like George if this was a law saying we're looking for people that look Canadian in the state of Vermont. That would be racial profiling.

Citizens that are here, that have -- that have not broken any laws should not be subjected to anything different than any other citizens. It's not about illegal immigrants. It's about legal Latino citizens that should not be targeted, and this law does that.

TAPPER: Matthew?

DOWD: To me, Arizona is a sideshow, and it's symptomatic of a bigger problem. And I don't think this is about the Arizona law. This is about people in a state -- and it's out going on all over the country -- that they see a federal government that's unwilling to enforce a law that's already on the books.

There is an immigration law on the books. It is illegal to come into this country. Arizona for years and years and years, including under the previous guest, Governor Napolitano, has asked the federal government to enforce the law, which they refuse to do in this -- in this context.

So it's not about a new law passed. It's about a state says that we think the federal government should enforce the law. They're not enforcing the law, so we're going to enforce the law.

I don't think it's the right response. I think we need the federal government to step up and actually perform an immigration policy. But it's not about Arizona.

(CROSSTALK)

SHARPTON: The federal law...

TAPPER: Reverend Sharpton...

(CROSSTALK)

SHARPTON: ... does not say that, based on reasonable suspicion of the police, they can go after someone which targets people that are Latino, since you're dealing with a problem with Mexicans coming across the border. The federal law does not say that, does not target that. We agree the federal laws should be looked at, reformed, and enforced, but to say that you're going to sacrifice the civil rights of Latinos and people of color because the federal government has not moved forward, I think, is very irresponsible.

TAPPER: George?

WILL: The Arizona law does not say that there should be racial profiling. And let me tell you what the...

(CROSSTALK)

SHARPTON: Well, then why did they just reform it over the weekend...

(CROSSTALK)

WILL: Let me tell you what the federal law says. ""Every alien 18 years of age and older shall at all times carry with him and have in his personal possession a certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to him."" That's been federal law for 58 years.

All that Arizona has done is say we at the state level are going to reinforce the federal law. This is legal. In 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the most liberal circuit court in this country, affirmed the constitutionality of an Arizona law that made it a state crime for employers to hire illegal immigrants. This is not bizarre behavior on Arizona's part.

SHARPTON: The state law does not say -- the state law says that a policeman, under reasonable suspicion -- it did not -- it does not say that in the federal law -- can go and make someone produce and document their citizenship. It does not say what you just read...

(CROSSTALK)

SHARPTON: With all due respect, Mr. Will, that is not what that federal law says. And the recognition of that is the state of Arizona's legislature just refined what they said over the weekend. They conceited that we were right and they had to refine it.

(CROSSTALK)

WILL: ... 50 years of case law refining the concept of reasonable suspicion. This is not a blank slate, Reverend.

VANDEN HEUVEL: Mr. Will, why is the law enforcement community in Arizona so deeply divided? I find that an interesting problem.

SHARPTON: Absolutely.

VANDEN HEUVEL: You have police chiefs who believe that this will endanger the public safety and security of the state and its citizens. You also have -- these are pragmatic, not moral reasons, even though this bill is state-sanctioned racial profiling and draconian, ugly, mean-spirited -- but you have a $3 billion budget deficit in Arizona. This may well loot that state's treasury as they fight this bill.

You're going to have economic boycotts, which you disagree with, but you're going to have them, as you had them to push that state to respect Martin Luther King holiday.

And finally, you have a situation where the crime rates in Arizona have declined over this last decade, and you have a border guard which has tripled since 2004. The budget has increased money for security. I personally think the security piece is overstated. You want to ensure an orderly flow of people and goods. But you need a humane pathway to citizenship.

TAPPER: Bill, what do you say to Arizona's citizens who are frustrated with the federal government, the law is not being enforced, there is an influx of illegal immigrants -- some of them, obviously not all of them, but some of them are involved in crimes -- what are they supposed to do?

MAHER: Well, I would hope the Constitution of the country is a little more important to them. I know that's asking a lot.

WILL: What constitutional provision does this violate?

MAHER: Well, I mean, nobody's been able to articulate a scenario where the police are stopping people for any other reason than they look Mexican and poor. You know, it kind of reminds me of -- what, was it Potter Stewart on the Supreme Court said about pornography, ""I know it when I see it""? That seems to be the standard the police are now using with immigration.

TAPPER: I think what...

SHARPTON: There's something called equal protection under the law.

(CROSSTALK)

TAPPER: The law has -- the law has -- to be fair to Governor Jan Brewer of Arizona, she signed an executive order the same day that she signed a law that said that a person's race alone cannot be enough to be reasonable suspicion. There needs to be more than...

SHARPTON: And now she's come back this weekend with something else. So are we going to keep redoing it? I think you'd have to concede that had this not been raised and these protests had not -- they would not themselves be now doing the moonwalk against their own bill.

DOWD: Jake, I think the situation is -- we keep falling back into an Arizona problem. The majority of the country...

(CROSSTALK)

SHARPTON: People in Arizona have an Arizona problem.

DOWD: No, the people of this country have an immigration problem.

SHARPTON: I agree.

DOWD: The majority of this country supports what Arizona did, the majority of the country. And two-thirds of people in Arizona support this. Do I think that the Arizona response is the right thing? No. But do I think that it represents a frustration with the federal government, just like what's going on in Wall Street -- the people of this country see Washington -- Democrats and Republicans -- complicit in what we do.

We don't enforce the laws on Wall Street, so we have a huge problem there. We don't enforce the immigration laws, so states like Arizona react in this way, which I don't think is actually reasonable. But I -- it's reasonable for them to be frustrated with the problem.

TAPPER: Bill?

MAHER: The government intrusion, you know, government power is something that really bothers conservatives, unless it's directed toward people who aren't white. You know, I mean, it does seem like there's some of that going on there. I mean...

(CROSSTALK)

TAPPER: Let me just interject. To be fair to conservatives, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, a conservative Republican, and Florida Congressman Connie Mack have had some tough words about parts of this law. Here's McDonnell on Tuesday.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MCDONNELL: I'm concerned about the whole idea of carrying papers and always have to be able to prove your citizenship. That brings up shades of some other regimes that were not particularly helpful to democracy and civil rights.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TAPPER: And Florida Congressman Connie Mack said in a press release, ""This law of frontier justice, where law enforcement officials are required to stop anyone based on reasonable suspicion that they may be in the country illegally, is reminiscent of a time during World War II when the Gestapo in Germany stopped people on the street and asked for their papers without probable cause.""

George, these are conservative Republicans, very -- I mean, nobody would question Bob McDonnell's bona fides as a conservative. And they are voicing serious concern about this law.

WILL: Yes. To enter Mr. McDonnell's Capitol building or to enter the House office building where Connie Mack works, you have to show a government-issued ID. I mean, this is -- this is synthetic hysteria by a herd of independent minds called our political class right now that has decided to stand up and worry about the Constitution being shredded by measures that have ample history of being sustained against constitutional challenges.

Now, Mr. Maher just said, if I heard him right, that conservatives basically are racists and they like government intrusion only against people who aren't white. I mean, that's the level...

(CROSSTALK)

TAPPER: We'll come to you in one second...

(CROSSTALK)

MAHER: Can you -- can you imagine if some of the -- what's going on with the Tea Party rallies, if they were a group of black people, you know, waving guns, coming up armed, talking about how you might -- you know, hinting about how you might have to take matters into your own hands if the government doesn't do what you want? Do you think the reaction in this country would be...

(CROSSTALK)

SHARPTON: ... very important point that needs to be addressed. When you say, Mr. Will, that if you go to Mr. McDonnell's building or Congressman Mack's building, you have to show ID, that is the point. Everyone has to show ID. They do not have guards stand there and say, ""Only you that I deem to be reasonably suspect because I think you come from a particular group that may be entering the building to do harm, we're going to search you."" Everyone is searched.

This is not the case in the Arizona law. This is not the case of what's going on in the raids with Sheriff Arpaio there. And this is not what we're protesting. If everyone was subjected to that, like the buildings you referred to, there would be no cause for concern.

VANDEN HEUVEL: And for George to talk about synthetic hysteria, I mean, your colleague at the Washington Post, Michael Gerson, took serious issue with the column you wrote underneath, saying that this issue is going to sort Republicans and conservatives politically, morally.

I think Latino-bashing, "	0
320	"WESTERVILLE, Ohio ÃÂ Like rival warships pulling into the same small harbor, Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton held rallies hours apart and exchanged oratorical barrages here Sunday.

Mr. Obama, of Illinois, struck at Mrs. ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs claim to expertise in the arena of national security, saying she had one moment of transformative decision ÃÂ Iraq ÃÂ and she fumbled it.

Ã¢ÂÂWhat precise foreign-policy experience is she claiming that makes her qualified to answer that telephone call at 3 a.m. in the morning?Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Obama asked an audience of more than 3,000 in a high school gymnasium and overflow rooms here. Ã¢ÂÂWhen it came to making the most important decision of our generation, Senator Clinton got it wrong.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mrs. ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs take on Mr. Obama hours earlier was not much more forgiving. She again suggested that his speeches were empty and that the first-term senator was too green to occupy the Oval Office in a time of crisis."	0

322	"HOUSTON, TEXAS Ã¢ÂÂ Anti-apartheid and human rights activist Archbishop Desmond Tutu has died in Texas at the age of 86.

His wife Leah Tutu told reporters that the couple were in Texas for holiday and had plans of greeting George H.W Bush who lost his wife few days ago.

According to Leah Tutu, Desmond Tutu was rushed to hospital in the wee hours of Saturday morning where he passed on. The cause of his death is not immediately known.

In August 2016, TutuÃ¢ÂÂs daughter Thandeka Tutu-Gxashe he was in the hospital for treatment of a recurring infection.

Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe may have described him as Ã¢ÂÂevilÃ¢ÂÂ, but Archbishop Desmond Tutu remained a much-loved figure across the world Ã¢ÂÂ principally for his role in South AfricaÃ¢ÂÂs struggle against apartheid.

During the long years that Nelson Mandela was in prison, Archbishop Tutu spoke out against the regime Ã¢ÂÂ and won the Nobel peace prize in 1984 for his efforts.

He was chosen by President Mandela to chair South AfricaÃ¢ÂÂs Truth and Reconciliation Commission and investigate the crimes committed by all sides during the apartheid regime.

Before his demise, Ã¢ÂÂthe ArchÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ as he was known Ã¢ÂÂ had remained irrepressible and influential both in his native South Africa and on the global political stage.

He was chairman of a group of former world leaders called The Elders, launched on Nelson MandelaÃ¢ÂÂs 89th birthday in 2007 with the aim of tackling some of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs most pressing problems.

President Obama Reflects on the Impact of Title IX

By President Obama

Coaching my daughter SashaÃ¢ÂÂs basketball team is one of those times when I just get to be Ã¢ÂÂDad.Ã¢ÂÂ I snag rebounds, run drills, and have a little fun. More importantly, I get to watch Sasha and her teammates improve together, start thinking like a team, and develop self-confidence.

Any parent knows there are few things more fulfilling than watching your child discover a passion for something. And as a parent, youÃ¢ÂÂll do anything to make sure he or she grows up believing she can take that ambition as far as she wants; that your child will embrace that quintessentially American idea that she can go as far as her talents will take her.

But it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt so long ago that something like pursuing varsity sports was an unlikely dream for young women in America. Their teams often made do with second-rate facilities, hand-me-down uniforms, and next to no funding.

What changed? Well, 40 years ago, committed women from around the country, driven by everyone who said they couldnÃ¢ÂÂt do something, worked with Congress to ban gender discrimination in our public schools. Title IX was the result of their efforts, and this week, we celebrated its 40th anniversaryÃ¢ÂÂ40 years of ensuring equal education, in and out of the classroom, regardless of gender.

I was reminded of this milestone last month, when I awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Pat Summitt. When she started out as a basketball coach, Pat drove the team van to away games. She washed the uniforms in her own washing machine. One night she and her team even camped out in an opponentÃ¢ÂÂs gym because they had no funding for a hotel. But she and her players kept their chins up and their heads in the game. And in 38 years at the University of Tennessee, Pat won eight national championships and tallied more than 1,000 winsÃ¢ÂÂthe most by any college coach, man or woman. More important, every single woman who ever played for Pat has either graduated or is on her way to a degree.

Today, thanks in no small part to the confidence and determination they developed through competitive sports and the work ethic they learned with their teammates, girls who play sports are more likely to excel in school. In fact, more women as a whole now graduate from college than men. This is a great accomplishmentÃ¢ÂÂnot just for one sport or one college or even just for women but for America. And this is what Title IX is all about.

LetÃ¢ÂÂs not forget, Title IX isnÃ¢ÂÂt just about sports. From addressing inequality in math and science education to preventing sexual assault on campus to fairly funding athletic programs, Title IX ensures equality for our young people in every aspect of their education. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a springboard for success: itÃ¢ÂÂs thanks in part to legislation like Title IX that more women graduate from college prepared to work in a much broader range of fields, including engineering and technology. IÃ¢ÂÂve said that women will shape the destiny of this country, and I mean it. The more confident, empowered women who enter our boardrooms and courtrooms, legislatures, and hospitals, the stronger we become as a country.

And that is what we are seeing today. Women are not just taking a seat at the table or sitting at the head of it, they are creating success on their own terms. The women who grew up with Title IX now pioneer scientific breakthroughs, run thriving businesses, govern states, and, yes, coach varsity teams. Because they do, todayÃ¢ÂÂs young women grow up hearing fewer voices that tell them Ã¢ÂÂYou canÃ¢ÂÂt,Ã¢ÂÂ and more voices that tell them Ã¢ÂÂYou can.Ã¢ÂÂ

We have come so far. But thereÃ¢ÂÂs so much farther we can go. There are always more barriers we can break and more progress we can make. As president, IÃ¢ÂÂll do my part to keep Title IX strong and vibrant, and maintain our schools as doorways of opportunity so every child has a fair shot at success. And as a dad, IÃ¢ÂÂll do whatever it takes to make sure that this country remains the place where, no matter who you are or what you look like, you can make it if you try."	0
325	"CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) have estimated the direct spending and revenue effects of H.R. 6079, the Repeal of Obamacare Act, as passed by the House of Representatives on July 11, 2012. H.R. 6079 would repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with the exception of one subsection that has no budgetary effect. This estimate reflects the spending and revenue projections in CBOÃ¢ÂÂs March 2012 baseline as adjusted to take into account the effects of the recent Supreme Court decision regarding the ACA.

For various reasons discussed in the report, the estimated budgetary effects of repealing the ACA by enacting H.R. 6079 are close to, but not equivalent to, an estimate of the budgetary effects of the ACA with the signs reversed.

What Is the Impact of Repealing the ACA on the Federal Budget?

Assuming that H.R. 6079 is enacted near the beginning of fiscal year 2013, CBO and JCT estimate that, on balance, the direct spending and revenue effects of enacting that legislation would cause a net increase in federal budget deficits of $109 billion over the 2013Ã¢ÂÂ2022 period. Specifically, we estimate that H.R. 6079 would reduce direct spending by $890 billion and reduce revenues by $1 trillion between 2013 and 2022, thus adding $109 billion to federal budget deficits over that period.

What Major Components Result in the Net Increase in Deficits?

Deficits would be increased under H.R. 6079 because the net savings from eliminating the insurance coverage provisions would be more than offset by the combination of other spending increases and revenue reductions:

The ACA contains a set of provisions designed to expand health insurance coverage, which, on net, are projected to cost the government money. The costs of those coverage expansionsÃ¢ÂÂwhich include the cost of the subsidies to be provided through the exchanges, increased outlays for Medicaid and the ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and tax credits for certain small employersÃ¢ÂÂwill be partially offset by penalty payments from employers and uninsured individuals, revenues from the excise tax on high-premium insurance plans, and net savings from other coverage-related effects. By repealing those coverage provisions of the ACA, over the 2013Ã¢ÂÂ2022 period, H.R. 6079 would yield gross savings of an estimated $1,677 billion and net savings (after accounting for the offsets just mentioned) of $1,171 billion.

The ACA also includes a number of other provisions related to health care that are estimated to reduce net federal outlays (primarily for Medicare). By repealing those provisions, H.R. 6079 would increase other direct spending in the next decade by an estimated $711 billion.

The ACA includes a number of provisions that are estimated to increase federal revenues (apart from the effect of provisions related to insurance coverage), mostly by increasing the Hospital Insurance (HI) payroll tax and extending it to net investment income for high- income taxpayers, and imposing fees or excise taxes on certain manufacturers and insurers. Repealing those provisions would reduce revenues by an estimated $569 billion over the 2013Ã¢ÂÂ2022 period.

What Would be the Effect of Repealing the ACA on Discretionary Spending?

In addition to those effects on direct spending and revenues, by CBOÃ¢ÂÂs estimates, repeal of the ACA would reduce the need for appropriations to the Internal Revenue Service by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. Repealing the ACA would also reduce the need for appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years, CBO estimates. Such savings might be reflected in reductions in total discretionary spending, or they might free up room for additional spending for other purposes under the caps on discretionary appropriations that were established by the Budget Control Act of 2011. H.R. 6079 would also repeal a number of authorizations for appropriations, which, if left in place, might or might not result in additional appropriations.

Why Are These Estimates Uncertain?

Projections of the budgetary impact of H.R. 6079 are quite uncertain because they are based, in large part, on projections of the effects of the ACA, which are themselves highly uncertain. Assessing the effects of making broad changes in the nationÃ¢ÂÂs health care and health insurance systems requires estimates of a broad array of technical, behavioral, and economic factors. Separating the incremental effects of the provisions in the ACA that affect spending for ongoing programs and revenue streams becomes more uncertain as the time since enactment grows. The recent Supreme Court decision that essentially made the expansion of the Medicaid program a state option has also increased the uncertainty of the estimates. However, CBO and JCT, in consultation with outside experts, have devoted a great deal of care and effort to the analysis of health care legislation in the past few years, and the agencies have strived to develop estimates that are in the middle of the distribution of possible outcomes."	0
326	"Supreme Court Case: Flemming vs. Nestor

Background to the Case:



The fact that workers contribute to the Social Security program's funding through a dedicated payroll tax establishes a unique connection between those tax payments and future benefits. More so than general federal income taxes can be said to establish ""rights"" to certain government services. This is often expressed in the idea that Social Security benefits are ""an earned right."" This is true enough in a moral and political sense. But like all federal entitlement programs, Congress can change the rules regarding eligibility--and it has done so many times over the years. The rules can be made more generous, or they can be made more restrictive. Benefits which are granted at one time can be withdrawn, as for example with student benefits, which were substantially scaled-back in the 1983 Amendments.



There has been a temptation throughout the program's history for some people to suppose that their FICA payroll taxes entitle them to a benefit in a legal, contractual sense. That is to say, if a person makes FICA contributions over a number of years, Congress cannot, according to this reasoning, change the rules in such a way that deprives a contributor of a promised future benefit. Under this reasoning, benefits under Social Security could probably only be increased, never decreased, if the Act could be amended at all. Congress clearly had no such limitation in mind when crafting the law. Section 1104 of the 1935 Act, entitled ""RESERVATION OF POWER,"" specifically said: ""The right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of this Act is hereby reserved to the Congress."" Even so, some have thought that this reservation was in some way unconstitutional. This is the issue finally settled by Flemming v. Nestor.



In this 1960 Supreme Court decision Nestor's denial of benefits was upheld even though he had contributed to the program for 19 years and was already receiving benefits. Under a 1954 law, Social Security benefits were denied to persons deported for, among other things, having been a member of the Communist party. Accordingly, Mr. Nestor's benefits were terminated. He appealed the termination arguing, among other claims, that promised Social Security benefits were a contract and that Congress could not renege on that contract. In its ruling, the Court rejected this argument and established the principle that entitlement to Social Security benefits is not contractual right. Flemming V. Nestor Case Name: FLEMMING V. NESTOR 363 U.S. 603 NO. 54. ARGUED FEBRUARY 24, 1960. - DECIDED JUNE 20, 1960. - 169 F. SUPP. 922, REVERSED . THE TERMINATION OF OLD-AGE BENEFITS PAYABLE TO AN ALIEN WHO, AFTER THE DATE OF ITS ENACTMENT (SEPTEMBER 1, 1954), IS DEPORTED UNDER SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT ON ANY ONE OF CERTAIN GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N). APPELLEE, AN ALIEN WHO HAD BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR OLD-AGE BENEFITS IN 1955, WAS DEPORTED IN 1956, PURSUANT TO SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, FOR HAVING BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY FROM 1933 TO 1939. SINCE THIS WAS ONE OF THE GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N), HIS OLD-AGE BENEFITS WERE TERMINATED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. HE COMMENCED THIS ACTION IN A SINGLE JUDGE DISTRICT COURT, UNDER SEC. 205(G) OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT, TO SECURE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THAT ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION. THE DISTRICT COURT HELD THAT SEC. 202(N) DEPRIVED APPELLEE OF AN ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHT AND, THEREFORE, VIOLATED THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. HELD: 1. ALTHOUGH THIS ACTION DREW INTO QUESTION THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SEC. 202(N), IT DID NOT INVOLVE AN INJUNCTION OR OTHERWISE INTERDICT THE OPERATION OF THE STATUTORY SCHEME; 28 U.S.C. SEC. 2282, FORBIDDING THE ISSUANCE OF AN INJUNCTION RESTRAINING THE ENFORCEMENT, OPERATION OR EXECUTION OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS FOR REPUGNANCE TO THE CONSTITUTION, EXCEPT BY A THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT, WAS NOT APPLICABLE; AND JURISDICTION OVER THE ACTION WAS PROPERLY EXERCISED BY THE SINGLE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT. PP. 606-608. 2. A PERSON COVERED BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT HAS NOT SUCH A RIGHT IN OLD-AGE BENEFIT PAYMENTS AS WOULD MAKE EVERY DEFEASANCE OF ""ACCRUED"" INTERESTS VIOLATIVE OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. PP. 608-611. (A) THE NONCONTRACTUAL INTEREST OF AN EMPLOYEE COVERED BY THE ACT CANNOT BE SOUNDLY ANALOGIZED TO THAT OF THE HOLDER OF AN ANNUITY, WHOSE RIGHTS TO BENEFITS ARE BASED ON HIS CONTRACTUAL PREMIUM PAYMENTS. PP. 608-610. (B) TO ENGRAFT UPON THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM A CONCEPT OF ""ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHTS"" WOULD DEPRIVE IT OF THE FLEXIBILITY AND BOLDNESS IN ADJUSTMENT TO EVER-CHANGING CONDITIONS WHICH IT DEMANDS AND WHICH CONGRESS PROBABLY HAD IN MIND WHEN IT EXPRESSLY RESERVED THE RIGHT TO ALTER, AMEND OR REPEAL ANY PROVISION OF THE ACT. PP. 610-611. 3. SECTION 202(N) OF THE ACT CANNOT BE CONDEMNED AS SO LACKING IN RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION AS TO OFFEND DUE PROCESS. PP. 611-612. 4. TERMINATION OF APPELLEE'S BENEFITS UNDER SEC. 202(N) DOES NOT AMOUNT TO PUNISHING HIM WITHOUT A TRIAL, IN VIOLATION OF ART. III, SEC. 2, CL. 3, OF THE CONSTITUTION OR THE SIXTH AMENDMENT; NOR IS SEC. 202(N) A BILL OF ATTAINDER OR EX POST FACTO LAW, SINCE ITS PURPOSE IS NOT PUNITIVE. PP. 612-621. FLEMMING , SECRETARY OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE, V. NESTOR . APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. MR. JUSTICE HARLAN DELIVERED THE OPINON OF THE COURT. FROM A DECISION OF THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOLDING SEC. 202(N) OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT (68 STAT. 1083, AS AMENDED, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(N)) UNCONSTITUTIONAL, THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE TAKES THIS DIRECT APPEAL PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. SEC. 1252. THE CHALLENGED SECTION, SET FORTH IN FULL IN THE MARGIN, (FN1) PROVIDES FOR THE TERMINATION OF OLD-AGE, SURVIVOR, AND DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS PAYABLE TO, OR IN CERTAIN CASES IN RESPECT OF, AN ALIEN INDIVIDUAL WHO, AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 1954 (THE DATE OF ENACTMENT OF THE SECTION), IS DEPORTED UNDER SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT (8 U.S.C. SEC. 1251A)) ON ANY ONE OF CERTAIN GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N). APPELLEE, AN ALIEN, IMMIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY FROM BULGARIA IN 1913, AND BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR OLD-AGE BENEFITS IN NOVEMBER 1955. IN JULY 1956 HE WAS DEPORTED PURSUANT TO SEC. 241(A)(6)(C)(I) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT FOR HAVING BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY FROM 1933 TO 1939. THIS BEING ONE OF THE BENEFIT TERMINATION DEPORTATION GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N), APPELLEE'S BENEFITS WERE TERMINATED SOON THEREAFTER, AND NOTICE OF THE TERMINATION WAS GIVEN TO HIS WIFE, WHO HAD REMAINED IN THIS COUNTRY. (FN2) UPON HIS FAILURE TO OBTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE REVERSAL OF THE DECISION, APPELLEE COMMENCED THIS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT, PURSUANT TO SEC. 205(G) OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT (53 STAT. 1370, AS AMENDED, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 405(G)), TO SECURE JUDICIAL REVIEW. (FN3) ON CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, THE DISTRICT COURT RULED FOR APPELLEE, HOLDING SEC. 202(N) UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT IN THAT IT DEPRIVED APPELLEE OF AN ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHT. 169 F. SUPP. 922. THE SECRETARY PROSECUTED AN APPEAL TO THIS COURT, AND, SUBJECT TO A JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION HEREINAFTER DISCUSSED, WE SET THE CASE DOWN FOR PLENARY HEARING. 360 U.S. 915. THE PRELIMINARY JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION IS WHETHER 28 U.S.C. SEC. 2282 IS APPLICABLE, AND THEREFORE REQUIRED THAT THE CASE BE HEARD BELOW BEFORE THREE JUDGES, RATHER THAN BY A SINGLE JUDGE, AS IT WAS. SECTION 2282 FORBIDS THE ISSUANCE, EXCEPT BY A THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT, OF ANY ""INTERLOCUTORY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION RESTRAINING THE ENFORCEMENT, OPERATION OR EXECUTION OF ANY ACT OF CONGRESS FOR REPUGNANCE TO THE CONSTITUTION ... ."" NEITHER PARTY REQUESTED A THREE-JUDGE COURT BELOW, AND IN THIS COURT BOTH PARTIES ARGUE THE INAPPLICABILITY OF SEC. 2282. IF THE PROVISION APPLIES, WE CANNOT REACH THE MERITS, BUT MUST VACATE THE JUDGMENT BELOW AND REMAND THE CASE FOR CONSIDERATION BY A THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT. SEE FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION V. THE DARLINGTON, INC., 352 U.S. 977. UNDER THE DECISIONS OF THIS COURT, THIS SEC. 205(G) ACTION COULD, AND DID, DRAW IN QUESTION THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SEC. 202(N). SEE, E.G., ANNISTON MFG. CO. V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 337, 345-346. HOWEVER, THE ACTION DID NO MORE. IT DID NOT SEEK AFFIRMATIVELY TO INTERDICT THE OPERATION OF A STATUTORY SCHEME. A JUDGMENT FOR THE APPELLEE WOULD NOT PUT THE OPERATION OF A FEDERAL STATUTE UNDER THE RESTRAINT OF AN EQUITY DECREE; INDEED, APART FROM ITS EFFECT UNDER THE DOCTRINE OF STARE DECISIS, IT WOULD HAVE NO OTHER RESULT THAN TO REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF APPELLEE'S BENEFITS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE THINK THAT WHAT WAS SAID IN GARMENT WORKERS V. DONNELLY CO., 304 U.S. 243, WHERE THIS COURT DEALT WITH AN ANALOGOUS SITUATION, IS CONTROLLING HERE: ""THE PREDECESSOR OF SEC. 2282 DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR A CASE WHERE THE VALIDITY OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS IS MERELY DRAWN IN QUESTION, ALBEIT THAT QUESTION BE DECIDED, BUT ONLY FOR A CASE WHERE THERE IS AN APPLICATION FOR AN INTERLOCUTORY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION TO RESTRAIN THE ENFORCEMENT OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS ... . HAD CONGRESS INTENDED THE PROVISION ... , FOR THREE JUDGES AND DIRECT APPEAL, TO APPLY WHENEVER A QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS BECAME INVOLVED, CONGRESS WOULD NATURALLY HAVE USED THE FAMILIAR PHRASE 'DRAWN IN QUESTION' ... ."" ID., AT 250. WE HOLD THAT JURISDICTION OVER THE ACTION WAS PROPERLY EXERCISED BY THE DISTRICT COURT, AND THEREFORE REACH THE MERITS. I. WE THINK THAT THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT SEC. 202(N) DEPRIVED APPELLEE OF AN ""ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHT."" 169 F. SUPP., AT 934. APPELLEE'S RIGHT TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS CANNOT PROPERLY BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN OF THAT ORDER. THE GENERAL PURPOSES UNDERLYING THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT WERE EXPOUNDED BY MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO IN HELVERING V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 619, 640-645. THE ISSUE HERE, HOWEVER, REQUIRES SOME INQUIRY INTO THE STATUTORY SCHEME BY WHICH THOSE PURPOSES ARE SOUGHT TO BE ACHIEVED. PAYMENTS UNDER THE ACT ARE BASED UPON THE WAGE EARNER'S RECORD OF EARNINGS IN EMPLOYMENT OR SELF-EMPLOYMENT COVERED BY THE ACT, AND TAKE THE FORM OF OLD-AGE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS INURING TO THE WAGE EARNER (KNOWN AS THE ""PRIMARY BENEFICIARY""), AND OF BENEFITS, INCLUDING SURVIVOR BENEFITS, PAYABLE TO NAMED DEPENDENTS (""SECONDARY BENEFICIARIES"") OF A WAGE EARNER. BROADLY SPEAKING, ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS DEPENDS ON SATISFYING STATUTORY CONDITIONS AS TO (1) EMPLOYMENT IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT OR SELF-EMPLOYMENT (SEE SEC. 210(A), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 410(A)); (2) THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF ""QUARTERS OF COVERAGE"" - I.E., THREE-MONTH PERIODS DURING WHICH NOT LESS THAN A STATED SUM WAS EARNED - THE NUMBER DEPENDING GENERALLY ON AGE (SEE SECS. 213-215, 42 U.S.C. SECS. 413-415); AND (3) ATTAINMENT OF THE RETIREMENT AGE (SEE SEC. 216(A), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 416(A)). SEC. 202(A), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(A). (FN4) ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFITS ONCE GAINED IS PARTIALLY OR TOTALLY LOST IF THE BENEFICIARY EARNS MORE THAN A STATED ANNUAL SUM, UNLESS HE OR SHE IS AT LEAST 72 YEARS OLD. SEC. 203(B), (E), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 403(B), (E). OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE IS THE FACT THAT ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS, AND THE AMOUNT OF SUCH BENEFITS, DO NOT IN ANY TRUE SENSE DEPEND ON CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROGRAM THROUGH THE PAYMENT OF TAXES, BUT RATHER ON THE EARNINGS RECORD OF THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THE PROGRAM IS FINANCED THROUGH A PAYROLL TAX LEVIED ON EMPLOYEES IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT, AND ON THEIR EMPLOYERS. THE TAX RATE, WHICH IS A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRST $4,800 OF EMPLOYEE ANNUAL INCOME, IS SET AT A SCALE WHICH WILL INCREASE FROM YEAR TO YEAR, PRESUMABLY TO KEEP PACE WITH RISING BENEFIT COSTS. I.R.C. OF 1954, SECS. 3101, 3111, 3121(A). THE TAX PROCEEDS ARE PAID INTO THE TREASURY ""AS INTERNAL REVENUE COLLECTIONS,"" I.R.C., SEC. 3501, AND EACH YEAR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE PROCEEDS IS APPROPRIATED TO A TRUST FUND, FROM WHICH BENEFITS AND THE EXPENSES OF THE PROGRAM ARE PAID. SEC. 201, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 401. IT WAS EVIDENTLY CONTEMPLATED THAT RECEIPTS WOULD GREATLY EXCEED DISBURSEMENTS IN THE EARLY YEARS OF OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM, AND SURPLUS FUNDS ARE INVESTED IN GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND THE INCOME RETURNED TO THE TRUST FUND. THUS, PROVISION IS MADE FOR EXPECTED INCREASING COSTS OF THE PROGRAM. THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MAY BE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED AS A FORM OF SOCIAL INSURANCE, ENACTED PURSUANT TO CONGRESS' POWER TO ""SPEND MONEY IN AID OF THE 'GENERAL WELFARE,'"" HELVERING V. DAVIS, SUPRA, AT 640, WHEREBY PERSONS GAINFULLY EMPLOYED, AND THOSE WHO EMPLOY THEM, ARE TAXED TO PERMIT THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS TO THE RETIRED AND DISABLED, AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. PLAINLY THE EXPECTATION IS THAT MANY MEMBERS OF THE PRESENT PRODUCTIVE WORK FORCE WILL IN TURN BECOME BENEFICIARIES RATHER THAN SUPPORTERS OF THE PROGRAM. BUT EACH WORKER'S BENEFITS, THOUGH FLOWING FROM THE CONTRIBUTIONS HE MADE TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY WHILE ACTIVELY EMPLOYED, ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH HE WAS CALLED UPON TO SUPPORT THE SYSTEM BY TAXATION. IT IS APPARENT THAT THE NONCONTRACTUAL INTEREST OF AN EMPLOYEE COVERED BY THE ACT CANNOT BE SOUNDLY ANALOGIZED TO THAT OF THE HOLDER OF AN ANNUITY, WHOSE RIGHT TO BENEFITS IS BOTTOMED ON HIS CONTRACTUAL PREMIUM PAYMENTS. IT IS HARDLY PROFITABLE TO ENGAGE IN CONCEPTUALIZATIONS REGARDING ""EARNED RIGHTS"" AND GRATUITIES."" CF. LYNCH V. UNITED STATES, 292 U.S. 571, 576-577. THE ""RIGHT"" TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IS IN ONE SENSE ""EARNED,"" FOR THE ENTIRE SCHEME RESTS ON THE LEGISLATIVE JUDGMENT THAT THOSE WHO IN THEIR PRODUCTIVE YEARS WERE FUNCTIONING MEMBERS OF THE ECONOMY MAY JUSTLY CALL UPON THAT ECONOMY, IN THEIR LATER YEARS, FOR PROTECTION FROM ""THE RIGORS OF THE POOR HOUSE AS WELL AS FROM THE HAUNTING FEAR THAT SUCH A LOT AWAITS THEM WHEN JOURNEY'S END IS NEAR."" HELVERING V. DAVIS, SUPRA, AT 641. BUT THE PRACTICAL EFFECTUATION OF THAT JUDGMENT HAS OF NECESSITY CALLED FORTH A HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INTERRELATED STATUTORY STRUCTURE. INTEGRATED TREATMENT OF THE MANIFOLD SPECIFIC PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM DEMANDS MORE THAN A GENERALIZATION. THAT PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO FUNCTION INTO THE INDEFINITE FUTURE, AND ITS SPECIFIC PROVISIONS REST ON PREDICTIONS AS TO EXPECTED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHICH MUST INEVITABLY PROVE LESS THAN WHOLLY ACCURATE, AND ON JUDGMENTS AND PREFERENCES AS TO THE PROPER ALLOCATION OF THE NATION'S RESOURCES WHICH EVOLVING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS WILL OF NECESSITY IN SOME DEGREE MODIFY. TO ENGRAFT UPON THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM A CONCEPT OF ""ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHTS"" WOULD DEPRIVE IT OF THE FLEXIBILITY AND BOLDNESS IN ADJUSTMENT TO EVER-CHANGING CONDITIONS WHICH IT DEMANDS. SEE WOLLENBERG, VESTED RIGHTS IN SOCIAL-SECURITY BENEFITS, 37 ORE. L. REV. 299, 359. IT WAS DOUBTLESS OUT OF AN AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR SUCH FLEXIBILITY THAT CONGRESS INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL ACT, AND HAS SINCE RETAINED, A CLAUSE EXPRESSLY RESERVING TO IT ""THE RIGHT TO ALTER, AMEND, OR REPEAL ANY PROVISION"" OF THE ACT. SEC. 1104, 49 STAT. 648, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 1304. THAT PROVISION MAKES EXPRESS WHAT IS IMPLICIT IN THE INSTITUTIONAL NEEDS OF THE PROGRAM. SEE ANALYSIS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, HEARINGS BEFORE A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 83D CONG., 1ST SESS., PP. 920 921. IT WAS PURSUANT TO THAT PROVISION THAT SEC. 202(N) WAS ENACTED. WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT A PERSON COVERED BY THE ACT HAS NOT SUCH A RIGHT IN BENEFIT PAYMENTS AS WOULD MAKE EVERY DEFEASANCE OF ""ACCRUED"" INTERESTS VIOLATIVE OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. II. THIS IS NOT TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT CONGRESS MAY EXERCISE ITS POWER TO MODIFY THE STATUTORY SCHEME FREE OF ALL CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINT. THE INTEREST OF A COVERED EMPLOYEE UNDER THE ACT IS OF SUFFICIENT SUBSTANCE TO FALL WITHIN THE PROTECTION FROM ARBITRARY GOVERNMENTAL ACTION AFFORDED BY THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE. IN JUDGING THE PERMISSIBILITY OF THE CUT-OFF PROVISIONS OF SEC. 202(N) FROM THIS STANDPOINT, IT IS NOT WITHIN OUR AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONGRESSIONAL JUDGMENT EXPRESSED IN THAT SECTION IS SOUND OR EQUITABLE, OR WHETHER IT COMPORTS WELL OR ILL WITH THE PURPOSES OF THE ACT. ""WHETHER WISDOM OR UNWISDOM RESIDES IN THE SCHEME OF BENEFITS SET FORTH IN TITLE II, IT IS NOT FOR US TO SAY. THE ANSWER TO SUCH INQUIRIES MUST COME FROM CONGRESS, NOT THE COURTS. OUR CONCERN HERE, AS OFTEN, IS WITH POWER, NOT WITH WISDOM."" HELVERING V. DAVIS, SUPRA, AT 644. PARTICULARLY WHEN WE DEAL WITH A WITHHOLDING OF A NONCONTRACTUAL BENEFIT UNDER A SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS, WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE CAN BE THOUGHT TO INTERPOSE A BAR ONLY IF THE STATUTE MANIFESTS A PATENTLY ARBITRARY CLASSIFICATION, UTTERLY LACKING IN RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION. SUCH IS NOT THE CASE HERE. THE FACT OF A BENEFICIARY'S RESIDENCE ABROAD - IN THE CASE OF A DEPORTEE, A PRESUMABLY PERMANENT RESIDENCE - CAN BE OF OBVIOUS RELEVANCE TO THE QUESTION OF ELIGIBILITY. ONE BENEFIT WHICH MAY BE THOUGHT TO ACCRUE TO THE ECONOMY FROM THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IS THE INCREASED OVER-ALL NATIONAL PURCHASING POWER RESULTING FROM TAXATION OF PRODUCTIVE ELEMENTS OF THE ECONOMY TO PROVIDE PAYMENTS TO THE RETIRED AND DISABLED, WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DESTITUTE OR NEARLY SO, AND WHO WOULD GENERALLY SPEND A COMPARATIVELY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEIR BENEFIT PAYMENTS. THIS ADVANTAGE WOULD BE LOST AS TO PAYMENTS MADE TO ONE RESIDING ABROAD. FOR THESE PURPOSES, IT IS, OF COURSE, CONSTITUTIONALLY IRRELEVANT WHETHER THIS REASONING IN FACT UNDERLAY THE LEGISLATIVE DECISION, AS IT IS IRRELEVANT THAT THE IN LOGIC APPLY. (FN5) SEE UNITED STATES V. PETRILLO, 332 U.S. 1, 8-9; STEWARD MACHINE CO. V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 548, 584-585; CF. CARMICHAEL V. SOUTHERN COAL CO., 301 U.S. 495, 510-513. NOR, APART FROM THIS, CAN IT BE DEEMED IRRATIONAL FOR CONGRESS TO HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE PUBLIC PURSE SHOULD NOT BE UTILIZED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUPPORT OF THOSE DEPORTED ON THE GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN THE STATUTE. WE NEED GO NO FURTHER TO FIND SUPPORT FOR OUR CONCLUSION THAT THIS PROVISION OF THE ACT CANNOT BE CONDEMNED AS SO LACKING IN RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION AS TO OFFEND DUE PROCESS. III. THE REMAINING, AND MOST INSISTENTLY PRESSED, CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIONS REST UPON ART. I, SEC. 9, CL. 3, AND ART. III, SEC. 2, CL. 3, OF THE CONSTITUTION, AND THE SIXTH AMENDMENT. (FN6) IT IS SAID THAT THE TERMINATION OF APPELLEE'S BENEFITS AMOUNTS TO PUNISHING HIM WITHOUT A JUDICIAL TRIAL, SEE WONG WING V. UNITED STATES, 163 U.S. 228; THAT THE TERMINATION OF BENEFITS CONSTITUTES THE IMPOSITION OF PUNISHMENT BY LEGISLATIVE ACT, RENDERING SEC. 202(N) A BILL OF ATTAINDER"" SEE UNITED STATES V. LOVETT, 328 U.S. 303; CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, 4 WALL. 277; AND THAT THE PUNISHMENT EXACTED IS IMPOSED FOR PAST CONDUCT NOT UNLAWFUL WHEN ENGAGED IN, THEREBY VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITION ON EX POST FACTO LAWS, SEE EX PARTE GARLAND, 4 WALL. 333. (FN7) ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF EACH OF THESE CONTENTIONS IS THE VALIDITY OF CHARACTERIZING AS ""PUNISHMENT"" IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL SENSE THE TERMINATION OF BENEFITS UNDER SEC. 202(N). IN DETERMINING WHETHER LEGISLATION WHICH BASES A DISQUALIFICATION ON THE HAPPENING OF A CERTAIN PAST EVENT IMPOSES A PUNISHMENT, THE COURT HAS SOUGHT TO DISCERN THE OBJECTS ON WHICH THE ENACTMENT IN QUESTION WAS FOCUSED. WHERE THE SOURCE OF LEGISLATIVE CONCERN CAN BE THOUGHT TO BE THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS FROM WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS BARRED, THE DISQUALIFICATION IS NOT PUNISHMENT EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BEAR HARSHLY UPON ONE AFFECTED. THE CONTRARY IS THE CASE WHERE THE STATUTE IN QUESTION IS EVIDENTLY AIMED AT THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED. IN THE EARLIEST CASE ON WHICH APPELLEE RELIES, A CLERGYMAN SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED A STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION BARRING FROM THAT PROFESSION - AND FROM MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS AND OFFICES - ALL WHO WOULD NOT SWEAR THAT THEY HAD NEVER MANIFESTED ANY SYMPATHY OR SUPPORT FOR THE CAUSE OF THE CONFEDERACY. CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA. THE COURT THUS DESCRIBED THE AIMS OF THE CHALLENGED ENACTMENT: ""THE OATH COULD NOT ... HAVE BEEN REQUIRED AS A MEANS OF ASCERTAINING WHETHER PARTIES WERE QUALIFIED OR NOT FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE CALLINGS OR THE TRUSTS WITH WHICH THEY WERE CHARGED. IT WAS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO REACH THE PERSON, NOT THE CALLING. IT WAS EXACTED, NOT FROM ANY NOTION THAT THE SEVERAL ACTS DESIGNATED INDICATED UNFITNESS FOR THE CALLINGS, BUT BECAUSE IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE SEVERAL ACTS DESERVED PUNISHMENT ... ."" ID., AT 320. ONLY THE OTHER DAY THE GOVERNING INQUIRY WAS STATED, IN AN OPINION JOINED BY FOUR MEMBERS OF THE COURT, IN THESE TERMS: ""THE QUESTION IN EACH CASE WHERE UNPLEASANT CONSEQUENCES ARE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON AN INDIVIDUAL FOR PRIOR CONDUCT, IS WHETHER THE LEGISLATIVE AIM WAS TO PUNISH THAT INDIVIDUAL FOR PAST ACTIVITY, OR WHETHER THE RESTRICTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL COMES ABOUT AS A RELEVANT INCIDENT TO A REGULATION OF A PRESENT SITUATION, SUCH AS THE PROPER QUALIFICATIONS FOR A PROFESSION."" DE VEAU V. BRAISTED, 363 U.S. 144, 160 (PLURALITY OPINION). IN EX PARTE GARLAND, SUPRA, WHERE THE COURT STRUCK DOWN AN OATH - SIMILAR IN CONTENT TO THAT INVOLVED IN CUMMINGS - REQUIRED OF ATTORNEYS SEEKING TO PRACTICE BEFORE ANY FEDERAL COURT, AS ALSO IN CUMMINGS, THE FINDING OF PUNITIVE INTENT DREW HEAVILY ON THE COURT'S FIRST-HAND ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE EVENTS AND THE MOOD OF THE THEN RECENT CIVIL WAR, AND ""THE FIERCE PASSIONS WHICH THAT STRUGGLE AROUSED."" CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 322. (FN8) SIMILARLY, IN UNITED STATES V. LOVETT, SUPRA, WHERE THE COURT INVALIDATED, AS A BILL OF ATTAINDER, A STATUTE FORBIDDING - SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS - THE FURTHER PAYMENT OF THE SALARIES OF THREE NAMED GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, THE DETERMINATION THAT A PUNISHMENT HAD BEEN IMPOSED RESTED IN LARGE MEASURE ON THE SPECIFIC CONGRESSIONAL HISTORY WHICH THE COURT WAS AT PAINS TO SPELL OUT IN DETAIL. SEE 328 U.S., AT 308-312. MOST RECENTLY, IN TROP V. DULLES, 356 U.S. 86, WHICH HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL A STATUTE PROVIDING FOR THE EXPATRIATION OF ONE WHO HAD BEEN SENTENCED BY A COURT-MARTIAL TO DISMISSAL OR DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE FOR WARTIME DESERTION, THE MAJORITY OF THE COURT CHARACTERIZED THE STATUTE AS PUNITIVE. HOWEVER, NO SINGLE OPINION COMMANDED THE SUPPORT OF A MAJORITY. THE PLURALITY OPINION RESTED ITS DETERMINATION, AT LEAST IN PART, ON ITS INABILITY TO DISCERN ANY ALTERNATIVE PURPOSE WHICH THE STATUTE COULD BE THOUGHT TO SERVE. ID., AT 97. THE CONCURRING OPINION FOUND IN THE SPECIFIC HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF THE PROVISION IN QUESTION COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF PUNITIVE INTENT. ID., AT 107-109. IT IS THUS APPARENT THAT, THOUGH THE GOVERNING CRITERION MAY BE READILY STATED, EACH CASE HAS TURNED ON ITS OWN HIGHLY PARTICULARIZED CONTEXT. WHERE NO PERSUASIVE SHOWING OF A PURPOSE ""TO REACH THE PERSON, NOT THE CALLING,"" CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 320, HAS BEEN MADE, THE COURT HAS NOT HAMPERED LEGISLATIVE REGULATION OF ACTIVITIES WITHIN ITS SPHERE OF CONCERN, DESPITE THE OFTEN-SEVERE EFFECTS SUCH REGULATION HAS HAD ON THE PERSONS SUBJECT TO IT. (FN9) THUS, DEPORTATION HAS BEEN HELD TO BE NOT PUNISHMENT, BUT AN EXERCISE OF THE PLENARY POWER OF CONGRESS TO FIX THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ALIENS ARE TO BE PERMITTED TO ENTER AND REMAIN IN THIS COUNTRY. FONG YUE TING V. UNITED STATES, 149 U.S. 698, 730; SEE GALVAN V. PRESS, 347 U.S. 522, 530-531. SIMILARLY, THE SETTING BY A STATE OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, AND THEIR MODIFICATION FROM TIME TO TIME, IS AN INCIDENT OF THE STATE'S POWER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ITS CITIZENS, AND ITS DECISION TO BAR FROM PRACTICE PERSONS WHO COMMIT OR HAVE COMMITTED A FELONY IS TAKEN AS EVIDENCING AN INTENT TO EXERCISE THAT REGULATORY POWER, AND NOT A PURPOSE TO ADD TO THE PUNISHMENT OF EX FELONS. HAWKER V. NEW YORK, 170 U.S. 189. SEE DE VEAU V. BRAISTED, SUPRA (REGULATION OF CRIME ON THE WATERFRONT THROUGH DISQUALIFICATION OF EX-FELONS FROM HOLDING UNION OFFICE). CF. HELVERING V. MITCHELL, 303 U.S. 391, 397-401, HOLDING THAT, WITH RESPECT TO DEFICIENCIES DUE TO FRAUD, A 50 PERCENT ADDITION TO THE TAX IMPOSED WAS NOT PUNISHMENT SO AS TO PREVENT, UPON PRINCIPLES OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY, ITS ASSESSMENT AGAINST ONE ACQUITTED OF TAX EVASION. TURNING, THEN, TO THE PARTICULAR STATUTORY PROVISION BEFORE US, APPELLEE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY CONTEND THAT THE LANGUAGE AND STRUCTURE OF SEC. 202(N), OR THE NATURE OF THE DEPRIVATION, REQUIRES US TO RECOGNIZE A PUNITIVE DESIGN. CF. WONG WING V. UNITED STATES, SUPRA (IMPRISONMENT, AT HARD LABOR UP TO ONE YEAR, OF PERSON FOUND TO BE UNLAWFULLY IN THE COUNTRY). HERE THE SANCTION IS THE MERE DENIAL OF A NONCONTRACTUAL GOVERNMENTAL BENEFIT. NO AFFIRMATIVE DISABILITY OR RESTRAINT IS IMPOSED, AND CERTAINLY NOTHING APPROACHING THE ""INFAMOUS PUNISHMENT"" OF IMPRISONMENT, AS IN WONG WING, ON WHICH GREAT RELIANCE IS MISTAKENLY PLACED. MOREOVER, FOR REASONS ALREADY GIVEN (ANTE, PP. 611-612), IT CANNOT BE SAID, AS WAS SAID OF THE STATUTE IN CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 319; SEE DENT V. WEST VIRGINIA, 129 U.S. 114, 126, THAT THE DISQUALIFICATION OF CERTAIN DEPORTEES FROM RECEIPT OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS WHILE THEY ARE NOT LAWFULLY IN THIS COUNTRY BEARS NO RATIONAL CONNECTION TO THE PURPOSES OF THE LEGISLATION OF WHICH IT IS A PART, AND MUST WITHOUT MORE THEREFORE BE TAKEN AS EVIDENCING A CONGRESSIONAL DESIRE TO PUNISH. APPELLEE ARGUES, HOWEVER, THAT THE HISTORY AND SCOPE OF SEC. 202(N) PROVE THAT NO SUCH POSTULATED PURPOSE CAN BE THOUGHT TO HAVE MOTIVATED THE LEGISLATURE, AND THAT THEY PERSUASIVELY SHOW THAT A PUNITIVE PURPOSE IN FACT LAY BEHIND THE STATUTE. WE DO NOT AGREE. WE OBSERVE INITIALLY THAT ONLY THE CLEAREST PROOF COULD SUFFICE TO ESTABLISH THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF A STATUTE ON SUCH A GROUND. JUDICIAL INQUIRIES INTO CONGRESSIONAL MOTIVES ARE AT BEST A HAZARDOUS MATTER, AND WHEN THAT INQUIRY SEEKS TO GO BEHIND OBJECTIVE MANIFESTATIONS IT BECOMES A DUBIOUS AFFAIR INDEED. MOREOVER, THE PRESUMPTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY WITH WHICH THIS ENACTMENT, LIKE ANY OTHER, COMES TO US FORBIDS US LIGHTLY TO CHOOSE THAT READING OF THE STATUTE'S SETTING WHICH WILL INVALIDATE IT OVER THAT WHICH WILL SAVE IT. ""IT IS NOT ON SLIGHT IMPLICATION AND VAGUE CONJECTURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS TO BE PRONOUNCED TO HAVE TRANSCENDED ITS POWERS, AND ITS ACTS TO BE CONSIDERED AS VOID."" FLETCHER V. PECK, 6 CRANCH 87, 128. OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM. THE PROVISION ORIGINATED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. H.R. 9366, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., SEC. 108. THE DISCUSSION IN THE HOUSE COMMITTEE REPORT, H.R. REP. NO. 1698, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., PP. 5, 25, 77, DOES NOT EXPRESS THE PURPOSE OF THE STATUTE. HOWEVER, IT DOES SAY THAT THE TERMINATION OF BENEFITS WOULD APPLY TO THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE ""DEPORTED FROM THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL ENTRY, CONVICTION OF A CRIME, OR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY ... ."" ID., AT 25. IT WAS EVIDENTLY THE THOUGHT THAT SUCH WAS THE SCOPE OF THE STATUTE RESULTING FROM ITS APPLICATION TO DEPORTATION UNDER THE 14 NAMED PARAGRAPHS OF SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT. ID., AT 77. (FN10) THE SENATE COMMITTEE REJECTED THE PROPOSAL FOR THE STATED REASON THAT IT HAD ""NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE SUFFICIENT STUDY TO ALL THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PROVISION, WHICH INVOLVES TERMINATION OF BENEFIT RIGHTS UNDER THE CONTRIBUTORY PROGRAM OF OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE ... ."" S. REP. NO. 1987, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., P. 23; SEE ALSO ID., AT 76. HOWEVER, IN CONFERENCE, THE PROPOSAL WAS RESTORED IN MODIFIED FORM, (FN11) AND AS MODIFIED WAS ENACTED AS SEC. 202(N). SEE H.R. CONF. REP. NO. 2679, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., P. 18. APPELLEE ARGUES THAT THIS HISTORY DEMONSTRATES THAT CONGRESS WAS NOT CONCERNED WITH THE FACT OF A BENEFICIARY'S DEPORTATION - WHICH IT IS CLAIMED ALONE WOULD JUSTIFY THIS LEGISLATION AS BEING PURSUANT TO A POLICY RELEVANT TO REGULATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM - BUT THAT IT SOUGHT TO REACH CERTAIN GROUNDS FOR DEPORTATION, THUS EVIDENCING A PUNITIVE INTENT. (FN12) IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IN THE MEAGRE HISTORY THE UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE OF PUNITIVE INTENT WHICH, UNDER PRINCIPLES ALREADY DISCUSSED, IS REQUIRED BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL ENACTMENT OF THIS KIND MAY BE STRUCK DOWN. EVEN WERE THAT HISTORY TO BE TAKEN AS EVIDENCING CONGRESS' CONCERN WITH THE GROUNDS, RATHER THAN THE FACT, OF DEPORTATION, WE DO NOT THINK THAT THIS, STANDING ALONE, WOULD SUFFICE TO ESTABLISH A PUNITIVE PURPOSE. THIS WOULD STILL BE A FAR CRY FROM THE SITUATIONS INVOLVED IN SUCH CASES AS CUMMINGS, WONG WING, AND GARLAND (SEE ANTE, P. 617), AND FROM THAT IN LOVETT, SUPRA, WHERE THE LEGISLATION WAS ON ITS FACE AIMED AT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS. THE LEGISLATIVE RECORD, HOWEVER, FALLS SHORT OF ANY PERSUASIVE SHOWING THAT CONGRESS WAS IN FACT CONCERNED ALONE WITH THE GROUNDS OF DEPORTATION. TO BE SURE CONGRESS DID NOT APPLY THE TERMINATION PROVISION TO ALL DEPORTEES. HOWEVER, IT IS EVIDENT THAT NEITHER DID IT REST THE OPERATION OF THE STATUTE ON THE OCCURRENCE OF THE UNDERLYING ACT. THE FACT OF DEPORTATION ITSELF REMAINED AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION FOR LOSS OF BENEFITS, AND EVEN IF A BENEFICIARY WERE SAVED FROM DEPORTATION ONLY THROUGH DISCRETIONARY SUSPENSION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER SEC. 244 OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT (66 STAT. 214, 8 U.S.C. SEC. 1254), SEC. 202(N) WOULD NOT REACH HIM. MOREOVER, THE GROUNDS FOR DEPORTATION REFERRED TO IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT EMBRACE THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THOSE DEPORTED, AS IS EVIDENT FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THE FOUR OMITTED GROUNDS, SUMMARIZED IN THE MARGIN. (FN13) INFERENCES DRAWN FROM THE OMISSION OF THOSE GROUNDS CANNOT ESTABLISH, TO THE DEGREE OF CERTAINTY REQUIRED, THAT CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN WAS WHOLLY WITH THE ACTS LEADING TO DEPORTATION, AND NOT WITH THE FACT OF DEPORTATION. (FN14) TO HOLD OTHERWISE WOULD BE TO REST ON THE ""SLIGHT IMPLICATION AND VAGUE CONJECTURE"" AGAINST WHICH CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL WARNED. FLETCHER V. PECK, SUPRA, AT 128. THE SAME ANSWER MUST BE MADE TO ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM THE FAILURE OF CONGRESS TO APPLY SEC. 202(N) TO BENEFICIARIES VOLUNTARILY RESIDING ABROAD. BUT CF. SEC. 202(T), ANTE, NOTE 5. CONGRESS MAY HAVE FAILED TO CONSIDER SUCH PERSONS; OR IT MAY HAVE THOUGHT THEIR NUMBER TOO SLIGHT, OR THE PERMANENCE OF THEIR VOLUNTARY RESIDENCE ABROAD TOO UNCERTAIN, TO WARRANT APPLICATION OF THE STATUTE TO THEM, WITH ITS ATTENDANT ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS OF SUPERVISION AND ENFORCEMENT. AGAIN, WE CANNOT WITH CONFIDENCE REJECT ALL THOSE ALTERNATIVES WHICH IMAGINATIVENESS CAN BRING TO MIND, SAVE THAT ONE WHICH MIGHT REQUIRE THE INVALIDATION OF THE STATUTE. REVERSED. FOOTNOTES Footnote 1- SECTION 202(N) PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: ""(N)(1) IF ANY INDIVIDUAL IS (AFTER THE DATE OF ENACTMENT OF THIS SUBSECTION) DEPORTED UNDER PARAGRAPH (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (10), (11), (12), (14), (15), (16), (17), OR (18) OF SECTION 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, THEN, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS TITLE: ""(A) NO MONTHLY BENEFIT UNDER THIS SECTION OR SECTION 223 (42 U.S.C.

330	"It's amazing but true: we can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, but the FBI doesn't have the power to block them from buying dynamite or an AK-47.

I believe strongly that they should. And so do the 500 mayors who are members of our bi-partisan coalition of Mayor Against Illegal Guns.

Advertisement

It is time to close the ""Terror Gap"" in our gun laws.

This morning I will be testifying at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee about the easy access that terror suspects have to guns and explosives. I wanted to share with lawmakers the hard-earned perspective New Yorkers have on this national security risk.

The car bomb the New York City Police Department found in Times Square on Saturday night was not the only attempted terrorist attack on our city since 9/11 -- far from it. And sadly, it won't be the last.

Since 1990, there have been more than 20 terrorists plots -- or actual attacks -- against our city.

In the last year alone, the NYPD -- working closely with federal authorities -- prevented two major planned attacks on our City. The first was last May, when the terrorists purchased guns and explosives as part of a planned attack on a Temple and Jewish Center in the Bronx.

The second was in September, when the City and federal authorities broke up a plot to detonate explosives in the New York City subway system.

Advertisement

And, of course, attacks and planned attacks have not been limited to New York.

Last June in Little Rock, Arkansas, a man opened fire at a military recruiting station, killing one private and wounding another. At the time of the shooting, the FBI was already investigating the man after his arrest in Yemen with a fake Somali passport. He was charged with murder and 16 counts of terrorist acts.

And on November 5, 2009, Major Nidal Hasan shot 43 people at Fort Hood -- killing 13. We know Hasan was able to buy a handgun despite having been under investigation by the FBI for links to terrorism.

The Bush Administration first proposed closing the Terror Gap in 2007. But because Congress has failed to act on that proposal, people who may want to do our country harm have been able to buy guns and explosives.

Today, the Government Accountability Office has released new data showing that suspects on the terrorism watch lists were able to buy guns and explosives from licensed US dealers 1,119 times between 2004 and 2010.

That is a serious and dangerous breach of national security.

That's why the more than 500 mayors in Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition that I co-chair with Mayor Tom Menino of Boston, support legislation to close the Terror Gap. This issue is a centerpiece of the coalition's fight to strengthen the federal background check system. Today, we have launched a new website -- www.TerrorGap.org -- to help educate Congress and the public about the Terror Gap and its consequences.

This legislation would give FBI agents the authority to block terror suspects from buying guns and explosives. It would also give them the ability to make exceptions when they determine that blocking a sale might tip off a suspect who is under investigation.

And the bill also allows those on the list to appeal their status to the Justice Department -- and challenge the determination in court.

Attorney General Eric Holder supported closing the Terror Gap in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year. And so does the vast majority of Americans.

A December poll by Republican pollster Frank Luntz found that 82% of NRA members, and 86% of other gun owners, support closing the Terror Gap.

To learn more and take action, please visit: www.TerrorGap.org.

In New York City, we are doing everything humanly possible to prevent another terrorist attack. Under Commissioner Kelly's leadership, the NYPD has developed one of the world's most advanced counter-terrorism programs. One thousand of our best officers work on counter-terrorism and intelligence efforts every day.

Advertisement

A key element of any smart counter-terrorism strategy is to make it harder for terrorists to strike.

That's why air passengers walk through metal detectors.

That's why our police officers randomly check bags in the subway.

That's why our police officers patrol sensitive locations.

And that's why it's just common sense to give the FBI the authority to keep terror suspects from buying guns and explosives."	0

First lady Melania Trump underwent kidney surgery Monday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center near Washington, DC, according to a statement from her office.

Trump had been experiencing an issue with her kidney that her office described as benign but requiring medical attention.

Ã¢ÂÂThis morning, first lady Melania Trump underwent an embolization procedure to treat a benign kidney condition. The procedure was successful, and there were no complications,Ã¢ÂÂ the first ladyÃ¢ÂÂs communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement.

Ã¢ÂÂMrs. Trump is at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and will likely remain there for the duration of the week. The first lady looks forward to a full recovery so she can continue her work on behalf of children everywhere,Ã¢ÂÂ Grisham wrote.

President Donald Trump remained in the White House during Melania TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs surgery. He tweeted just after 5 p.m. Monday that he was heading to hospital to visit his wife in Marine One.

Ã¢ÂÂHeading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!Ã¢ÂÂ Trump tweeted.

Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers! Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2018

Trump, who turned 48 last month, had surgery at Walter Reed in nearby Bethesda, Maryland, on Monday morning.

She is the first US first lady to undergo such a serious medical procedure while in the White House since Nancy Reagan had a mastectomy in October 1987. Rosalynn Carter underwent surgery to remove a benign lump from her breast in April 1977. Weeks after Betty Ford became first lady, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy in September 1974.

The first lady did not move to Washington until six months into the administration, choosing to let their son, Barron, finish the 2017 school year in New York. More recently, Melania Trump has had a more public profile. On April 24, she and the President hosted the first official state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that was planned and executed primarily by the first lady.

Trump was responsible for every aspect of the formal dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, from the hand-selected ivory tablecloths to the menu, which the first lady designed to meld American food with French influence. During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier. The hat set the internet ablaze, with references and comparisons to BeyoncÃÂ©, the suffragette movement and even television character Olivia Pope of Ã¢ÂÂScandal.Ã¢ÂÂ

On May 7, Trump, a relatively private first lady by comparison to her most recent predecessors, was once again front and center, this time to unveil her formal platform, Be Best. She kicked off the initiative with a Rose Garden speech lasting 11 minutes, the longest public speaking engagement during her 16-month tenure as first lady.

Be Best is a three-pronged platform with a focus on opioid addiction and families, general physical and emotional well-being of children, and kindness and safety for kids using social media. The latter caused a firestorm of controversy because it encompasses cyberbullying, a tactic that Melania TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs husband, the President, has often been accused of fueling. In March, the first lady addressed the criticism she has faced by taking up the issue during opening remarks to a meeting she convened at the White House for tech industry leaders from Google, Snap, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and others.

Ã¢ÂÂI am well-aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂI have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me from doing what I know is right.Ã¢ÂÂ

Melania Trump has also appeared with her husband several times in recent weeks. He was seated in the front row during her Be Best speech, after which he made remarks praising her commitment to helping children, and he was again second to speak, after his wife, during the Military Mothers and Spouses Ceremony on Friday in the White House East Room.

Ã¢ÂÂSheÃ¢ÂÂs become a very, very popular first lady. IÃ¢ÂÂm reading that Ã¢ÂÂ¦ They love Melania,Ã¢ÂÂ the President said. A new CNN poll released May 7 had the first ladyÃ¢ÂÂs favorable rating up 10 points since January to 57%.

CNN Live Event/Special

Republican Presidential Debate

Aired June 05, 2007 - 19:00 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



WOLF BLITZER, HOST: Let's begin our questioning.

Right now Tom Fahey of the New Hampshire Union Leader with the first question.



TOM FAHEY, NEW HAMPSHIRE UNION LEADER: Thanks, Wolf.



Governor Romney, I wanted to start by asking you a question on which every American has formed an opinion.



We have lost 3,400 troops, civilian casualties are even higher, and the Iraqi government does not appear ready to provide for the security of its own country. Knowing everything you know right now, was it a mistake for us to invade Iraq?



MITT ROMNEY, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS: Well, the question is, kind of, a non sequitur, if you will. What I mean by that -- or a null set -- that is that if you're saying let's turn back the clock and Saddam Hussein had opening up his country to IAEA inspectors and they'd come in and they'd found that there were no weapons of mass destruction, had Saddam Hussein therefore not violated United Nations resolutions, we wouldn't be in the conflict we're in.



But he didn't do those things, and we knew what we knew at the point we made the decision to get in.



I supported the president's decision based on what we knew at that time.



I think we were underprepared and underplanned for what came after we knocked down Saddam Hussein.



By the way, Harry Reid was wrong. We did not lose the war in Iraq. And that's not the sort of thing you say when you have men and women in harm's way.



We did, however, not do a great job after we knocked down Saddam Hussein and won the war to take him down and his military.



And at this stage, the right thing for us to do is to see if we could possibly stabilize the central government in Iraq so that they can have stability, and so we can bring our troops home as soon as possible.



Not to do that adds an enormous potential risk that the whole region could be embroiled in a regional conflict. BLITZER: Governor, thank you, but the question was, knowing what you know right now -- not what you knew then, what you know right now -- was it a mistake for the United States to invade Iraq?



ROMNEY: Well, I answered the question by saying it's a non- sequitur. It's a non -- null set kind of question, because you can go back and say, ""If we knew then what we know now, by virtue of inspectors having been let in and giving us that information, by virtue of if Saddam Hussein had followed the U.N. resolutions, we wouldn't be having this discussion.""



So it's a hypothetical that I think is an unreasonable hypothetical.



And the answer is: We did what we did. We did the right thing based on what we knew at that time. I think we made mistakes following the conduct or the collapse of Saddam's government.



FAHEY: Mayor Giuliani, same question to you. Knowing what you know right now, was it a good decision?



RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: Absolutely the right thing to do. It's unthinkable that you would leave Saddam Hussein in charge of Iraq and be able to fight the war on terror.



And the problem is that we see Iraq in a vacuum. Iraq should not be seen in a vacuum. Iraq is part of the overall terrorist war against the United States.



The problem the Democrats make is they're in denial. That's why you hear things like you heard in the debate the other night, that, you know, Iran really isn't dangerous; it's 10 years away from nuclear weapons.



Iran is not 10 years away from nuclear weapons. And the danger to us is not just missiles. The danger to us is a state like Iran handing nuclear weapons over to terrorists.



So it has to be seen in that light. And we have to be successful in Iraq.



BLITZER: Senator McCain, arguably going to war is the most important decision a member of the Senate can make.



Did you read the national intelligence estimate, which included all the caveats on whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?



SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: I did not read that particular document. I received hundreds of briefing, tens and hundreds of hours of study and background and information on it. And the fact is that the sanctions were breaking down. The sanctions were not going to hold. We had a multi-billion dollar scandal in the form of oil for food.



The fact is that Saddam Hussein had used weapons of mass destruction before on his own people and on his enemies. And if he'd gotten them again, he'd have used them again. That was his commitment and his belief, that he was going to. And we did the right thing.



The problem was the mismanagement of the conflict.



BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.



Senator Brownback, you're also a member of the United States Senate. Did you read that classified national intelligence estimate?



SEN. SAM BROWNBACK (R), KANSAS: I don't remember that report. I had a number of briefings and I held a number of committee hearings. At that time, I was chairing the Middle East Subcommittee on Foreign Relations. And we held hearings on this topic and what was taking place and what Saddam was doing.



But the issue is that we've got to put forward, now, a political plan. And that's something I'm going to introduce tomorrow, a political plan to create a three-state solution in Iraq: a Kurdish state, a Sunni state, a Shia state. Because Iraq is more three groups held together by exterior forces. And that's what we've lacked is a political plan to get us moving forward in success.



BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.



Governor Gilmore, let me go to you. You chaired this commission. Do you think it was appropriate that members of Congress would authorize the president to go to war without reading that national intelligence estimate?



JIM GILMORE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA: You know, I think the people who are in Congress who are responsible for sending this country to war, with the enormous dangers that it has geopolitically and strategically, ought to read at least that kind of material. I know they get a lot of stuff and they can't read everything.



But you know what, Wolf? I think the true business is this: The interests of the United States is in creating as much stability as possible in the Middle East. There is a very great danger to this country: our interests in Israel, our interests in energy and in other ways. There is a giant danger of the Middle East becoming an unstable place.



Saddam Hussein was unstable, and so taking him out was good there. But we certainly didn't anticipate the further instability that was to come after.



BLITZER: We're going to bring all of you in, but I want to go to Scott Spradling of WMUR for the next question.



SCOTT SPRADLING, WMUR-TV: Thanks, Wolf.



Senator McCain, we've just spent a few minutes looking back. I'd ask you to look forward now, if you will.



Since June 1st there have been at least 17 confirmed deaths of American soldiers in Iraq. Approximately 100 U.S. troops are dying there every month. If our top military commander in Iraq, General Petraeus, reports back to Congress this September that the surge hasn't significantly improved the situation on the ground, what then?



MCCAIN: Well, let me say, first of all, I know how frustrated and saddened all Americans are. This morning I was with the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfeboro, who sacrificed his life. And our hearts and our sympathy goes out to all those who have sacrificed their lives in this conflict.



I (inaudible) think this strategy needs to be given a chance to succeed. We haven't barely gotten the fifth brigade over there, which is part of this strategy.



I am convinced that if we fail and we have to withdraw, they will follow us home. It will be a base for Al Qaida. And we will be facing greater challenges and greater sacrifices than that already made by Matthew Stanley and his family.



There is no doubt in my mind that this will become a base for terrorism, there will be chaos in the region. And when Senator Clinton says this is Mr. Bush's war, that this is President Bush's war -- when President Clinton was in power, I didn't say that Bosnia, our intervention there was President Clinton's war. When we intervened in Kosovo, I didn't say it was President Clinton's war.



What Senator Clinton doesn't understand that presidents don't lose wars. Political parties don't lose wars.



Nations lose wars, and nations lose the -- have the consequences of failure.



BLITZER: Senator...



MCCAIN: We must succeed in this conflict.



BLITZER: ... the question was, if General Petraeus says...



(APPLAUSE)



... it's not working so far in September, what do you do then?



MCCAIN: Then you have to examine the options.



And I'll tell you the options: One is the division that Sam described. You would have to divide bedrooms in Baghdad because Sunni and Shia are married to each other. You have 2 million Sunni and 4 million Shia living in Baghdad together.



You would have to -- you withdraw to the borders and watch genocide take place inside Baghdad. You watch the destabilization of Jordan. You see further jeopardy of Israel because of the threats of Hezbollah and Iranian hegemony in the region.



All of the options I could run through with you. My friend, none of them are good. That's why we must succeed and give it a chance to succeed.



BLITZER: All right.



Now, let me bring in Governor Thompson.



Go ahead, same question to you: If General Petraeus says it's not working in September, what should the U.S. do then?



TOMMY THOMPSON, FORMER HHS SECRETARY: The first thing the president should do is demand the al-Maliki government to vote as to whether or not they want the United States to stay in Iraq. We've been there four years. Give the government the responsibility of voting.



If they vote ""yes,"" how are they going to help us win this war? If they vote ""no,"" we should redeploy our forces outside.



Secondly, there are 18 territories in Iraq, geographically defined. Those 18 territories, just like 50 states in America, should elect their state leaders. And if they do so, the Shiites will elect Shiites, Sunnis will elect Sunnis, Kurds will elect Kurds. And you know something? People will go to those particular territories, and you get rid of this civil war internecine.



Number three...



BLITZER: All right...



THOMPSON: ... I would like to have the oil revenue proceeds -- very quickly -- oil revenue proceeds split: one-third to the federal government, one-third to the states, and one-third to every man, woman and child. And that will get everybody a stake in their country.



BLITZER: Let me bring in Congressman Duncan Hunter.



Congressman, if it's not working at that point, how much longer should the United States stay?



REP. DUNCAN HUNTER (R), CALIFORNIA: Well, Wolf, you know, I read that NIE report, and I held briefings before we made the vote to go in and invited everybody, Democrat and Republican, to get the classified information.



And this depends -- the turnover of the security apparatus depends on one thing: reliable Iraqi forces.



You've got 129 Iraqi battalions. We've trained them up. We've got a lot of them in the fight. Over the next three to four months, we need to get them all in the fight, get them that combat capability. When they're combat-hardened, we rotate them in, we displace American heavy combat forces off that battlefield, and Americans come home. And, Wolf...



BLITZER: Thank you.



HUNTER: ... I can tell you, as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for the last four years, I have the credentials to leave Iraq the right way.



BLITZER: Congressman Ron Paul, how much longer should the United States stay in Iraq?



REP. RON PAUL (R), TEXAS: The sooner we come home, the better. If they declare there's no progress in September, we should come home. It was a mistake to go, so it's a mistake to stay.



If we made the wrong diagnosis, we should change the treatment. So we're not making progress there and we should come home.



The weapons weren't there and we went in under U.N. resolutions. And our national security was not threatened. We're more threatened now by staying.



BLITZER: Governor Huckabee, do you have confidence in the government of Iraq...



(APPLAUSE)



... the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, that he's going to do what needs to be done?



MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: I think there's some real doubt about that, Wolf.



But I want to remind all of us on this stage and the people in the audience that there's a reason that this is such a struggle. And I think we miss it over here in the West.



Today's the birthday of Ronald Reagan. We all would believe that Ronald Reagan is the one who ended the Cold War and Ronald Reagan is the one who helped bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union.



But there's a group of people who don't believe that, and that's the Taliban. They believe they brought about the demise of the Soviet Union because of the way they fought in Afghanistan.



And what I want to just mention is that it is not the size of the dog in the fight, it is the size of the fight in the dog. And we underestimate -- grossly underestimate how fierce this dog is and how determined they are to destroy every last one of us.



BLITZER: All right.



Congressman Tom Tancredo, what do you say?



REP. TOM TANCREDO (R), COLORADO: I'll tell you this, that if it comes to that point in that time that you described, that the surge is apparent that it is not working, I did support it. I hope to God it does work. I hope I'm wrong. I hope we pacify Iraq.



However, if it is apparent that we cannot, then we have to do and tell the Iraqis the exact same thing that Benjamin Franklin said when he came out of the convention in 1787 and somebody said to him, ""Dr. Franklin, what have you given us?"" And he said, ""A republic, if you can keep it.""



It is exactly that time and it is exactly that thing that we have to say to the Iraqi government: ""We have given you this. We bought it with our blood and sweat. It is now up to you to keep it.""



And I want the Iraqis to be in fact patrolling Baghdad. If they need vehicles, you let them have the vehicles. But I want them patrolling their city and putting their lives at risk.



Then we move out.



BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.



(APPLAUSE)



I want to go to the next question. I want to go back to Tom.



Tom, go ahead.



FAHEY: Senator Brownback, President Bush has stated that states that sponsor terrorism are no different than terrorists themselves. Yet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recently met with Iranian officials to discuss security in Iraq. Iran is a known support of Hezbollah, Hamas.



Did President Bush make the right call in opening a dialogue with Iran?



BROWNBACK: I think he made a right call on saying that about terrorist states, particularly Iran. But I think we have to at times talk with them in different situations.



Like, before we went into Afghanistan, we talked with Iran. It wasn't we were negotiating. We didn't open up formal diplomatic relations and we shouldn't.



Iran is the lead sponsor of terrorism. Ahmadinejad just this past week called for the destruction of Israel, continues to call for attacking of the United States.



On Iraq, I think we need to talk with them. I think we have to confront them aggressively for what they are, which is the lead sponsor of terrorism in the world. I think we need to push the sanctions forward more aggressively. I think we need to work with the labor union movement that's developing inside of Iran. You had a bus driver strike that recently took place.



And I think we have to show that purpose and resolve, that we're going to confront these guys and we're going to stand with our allies like Israel, we're going to stand against them oppressing and pushing us, and trying to fund terrorists against us.



BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.



Congressman Hunter, let me bring...



BROWNBACK: Senator, if you don't mind.



BLITZER: Excuse me, Senator.



BROWNBACK: That's OK.



BLITZER: Congressman Hunter, let me bring you back in. Do you agree with Senator Brownback that President Bush made the right decision in opening a direct dialogue with Iran?



HUNTER: With two conditions. And I think that you do have a dialogue with everybody, whether they're adversaries or friends.



The two conditions are: Number one, they are moving deadly equipment across the border that is killing Americans in Iraq.



We have license to utilize anything that we want to use: special operations, intelligence, whatever it takes to stop that deadly equipment from moving across the border and hitting Americans in Iraq. And we don't give that up with these talks.



Secondly, they've got about 1,000 centrifuges now working, enriching the material that can make, at some point, a nuclear device. The United States reserves the right to preempt, and we may have to preempt that nuclear weapons program. We cannot allow them to have a nuclear device.



With those two caveats, talk to your enemies.



BLITZER: If it came down to a preemptive U.S. strike against Iran's nuclear facility if necessary, would you authorize as president the use of tactical nuclear weapons?



HUNTER: I would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons if there was no other way to preempt those particular centrifuges.



When the Osirak reactor was hit in '86, when the six F-18s came over the horizon and knocked that out, they didn't need anything but conventional weapons.



Probably it's going to take a little more than that. I don't think it's going to take tactical nukes.



BLITZER: What do you think, Mayor? Do you think, if you were president of the United States and it came down to Iran having a nuclear bomb, which you say is unacceptable, you would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons?



GIULIANI: Part of the premise of talking to Iran has to be that they have to know very clearly that it is unacceptable to the United States that they have nuclear power. I think it could be done with conventional weapons, but you can't rule out anything and you shouldn't take any option off the table.



And during the debate the other night, the Democrats seemed to be back in the 1990s. They don't seem to have gotten beyond the Cold War. Iran is a threat, a nuclear threat, not just because they can deliver a nuclear warhead with missiles. They're a nuclear threat because they are the biggest state sponsor of terrorism and they can hand nuclear materials to terrorists.



And we just saw it just last week in New York, an attempt by Islamist terrorists to attack JFK airport; three weeks ago, an attempt to attack Fort Dix.



These are real problems. This war is not a bumper sticker. This war is a real war.



BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.



(APPLAUSE)



BLITZER: Let me bring Governor Gilmore in.



What do you say about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons if that's what it takes to go deep underground and destroy those Iraqi facilities?



GILMORE: One of the central problems of the Middle East is the desire for Iran to dominate that portion of the world, because of what they are doing. And that is why I believe that they are seeking this kind of nuclear capacity. That is one of the reasons why we are, in fact, in Iraq.



And that's why our soldiers, when they fight and die there, are in fact serving the interests of the United States. Nobody ought to have any doubt about that.



With respect to Iran, the policy I would follow would be dual.



Number one, we need to work with our European allies in order to put in appropriate sanctions. We need to communicate directly with the Iranians that we are going to offer them an opportunity to work with us.



But we are also going to say that having a nuclear weapon is unacceptable; they need to understand it. And all options are on the table by the United States in that instance.



BLITZER: All right. Thank you, Governor.



Governor Romney, I want to get you on the record. Do you agree with the mayor, the governor, others here, that the use of tactical nuclear weapons, potentially, would be possible if that were the only way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb?



ROMNEY: You don't take options off the table, but what you do is stand back and say, ""What's going on here?"" You see what's happening in Sudan and Afghanistan, in Iraq and Iran. All over the world, we're seeing the same thing happening, and that is people are testing the United States of America. And we have to make sure they understand that we're not arrogant; we have resolve. And we have the strength to protect our interests and to protect people who love liberty.



For that to happen, we're going to have to not just attack each one of these problems one by one, but say, how do we help move the world of Islam so that the moderate Muslims can reject the extreme?



And for that to happen, we're going to have to have a strong military and an effort to combine with our allies in such a way, we combine for an effort to help move Islam toward modernity.



That's what we're going to have to do, instead of looking at each theater one by one and saying, ""We'll bomb here, we'll attack here, we'll go to Sudan.""



I watched the Democrats...



BLITZER: Thank you.



ROMNEY: ... they don't think there's a war on terror.



BLITZER: Thank you.



ROMNEY: There's a war going on, and we need a broad response to make sure that these people have a different vision.



(APPLAUSE)



BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.



All of you are going to have an opportunity to weigh on all of these questions as well.



If you're hearing some sounds out there, it's lightning here in Manchester, New Hampshire. Those are the crackling sounds that you're hearing.



Let's go back to Scott.



SPRADLING: Thanks, Wolf.



Congressman Tancredo, let's talk immigration.



TANCREDO: OK.



SPRADLING: You oppose the immigration reform compromise, calling it, quote, ""the worst piece of legislation to come down the pike in a long time."" Just this morning in Manchester, you vowed to oust any senator who supports the bill, including possibly New Hampshire's senior Senator Judd Gregg, who's undecided, and says to your comments that you are part of the know-nothing wing of the political spectrum.



In the meantime, the president says his plan is the last best chance for serious immigration reform.



He's criticized conservatives for being obstructionists.



With that tension at stake, if this becomes law, what are the consequences for the country?



TANCREDO: They are incredible, and they are disastrous.



And that is exactly why I have said what I've said, and that is why I have consistently tried to impress upon the American public the seriousness of this issue.



We're not just talking about the number of jobs that we may be losing or the number of kids that are in our schools and impacting our school system or the number of people that are abusing our hospital system and taking advantage of the welfare system in this country. We're not just talking about that.



We're talking about something that goes to the very heart of this nation: whether or not we will actually survive as a nation.



And here's what I mean by that.



What we're doing here in this immigration battle is testing our willingness to actually hold together as a nation or split apart into a lot of balkanized pieces.



We are testing our willingness to actually hold on to something called the English language, something that is the glue that is supposed to hold us together as a nation.



We are becoming a bilingual nation. And that is not good.



And that is the fearful part of this. The ramifications are much, much more significant than any that we've been discussing so far.



And so, yes, I have said dramatic things. And, yes, I am willing to do whatever is necessary to try to stop this piece of legislation. And that includes go after any Republican that votes for it, because the Republicans can stop this.



BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Congressman.



(APPLAUSE)



Mayor Giuliani, what do you think the consequences for the nation are if this immigration plan proposed by President Bush goes through?



GIULIANI: The problem with this immigration plan is it has no real unifying purpose. It's a typical Washington mess. It's everybody compromises -- four or five compromises.



And the compromises leave you with the following conclusion: The litmus test you should have for legislation is, is it going to make things better? And when you look at these compromises, it is quite possible it will make things worse. The organizing purpose should be that our immigration laws should allow us to identify everyone who is in this country that comes here from a foreign country.



They should have a tamper-proof I.D. card. It should be in a database that allows you to figure out who they are, why they're here, make sure they're not illegal immigrants coming here for a bad purpose, and then to be able to throw out the ones who are not in that database.



We can do that. Credit card companies...



BLITZER: Thank you.



GIULIANI: ... take care of data that is greater than that.



BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.



I want to get to Senator McCain in a moment, but first, Governor Romney, Senator McCain has accused you of flip-flopping on this issue, in effect.



Yesterday in Miami, he said the following: ""Pandering for votes on this issue while offering no solution to the problem amounts to doing nothing. And doing nothing is silent amnesty.""



What do you say to Senator McCain?



ROMNEY: Well, he's my friend. He campaigned for me two times. I consider him a friend. I'm not going to make this a matter of personal politics. It's an issue that's way too important for that.



My view is that we should enforce our immigration laws.



And this bill, unfortunately, has at least one provision that's a real problem. It's the Z visa.



And what it allows is people who have come here illegally to stay here for the rest of their lives -- not necessarily as citizens; they have to wait 13 years to become citizens. That's not the point.



The point is: Every illegal alien, almost every one, under this bill, gets to stay here. That's not fair to the millions and millions of people around the world that would love to come here, join with family members, bring skill and education that we need.



It's simply not fair to say those people get put ahead in the line of all the people who've been waiting legally to come to this country.



(APPLAUSE)



BLITZER: All right, Senator McCain, this is your chance. I'd like you to respond as someone who is the co-author of this legislation.



MCCAIN: Well, first of all, I agree with Judd Gregg. He's a great senator.



(APPLAUSE)



Second of all, Rudy, you just described our legislation, so I'd be glad to have further conversation with you, because it does account for people who are here illegally.



It does have an employment verification system. And it weeds out those who shouldn't be here, and it gives others a chance to remain in this country.



Look, this is a national security issue, first and foremost. Ever since 9/11, it's a national security issue.



People came to Fort Dix, New Jersey, from across our southern border and tried to kill our soldiers.



For us to do nothing is silent and de facto amnesty.



What we have done is what you expect us to do, my friends, and that's come together with the president of the United States, the leader of our party, Democrat and Republican, conservative Republicans like Jon Kyl, Johnny Isakson, Saxby Chambliss and Trent Lott, and sit down and figure out an approach to this problem.



And it is a serious national security problem.



We need to act, my friends. And if someone else has a better idea, I'd love to have them pursue -- give it to us.



BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.



(LAUGHTER)



(APPLAUSE)



Hold on.



MCCAIN: That can get...



BLITZER: Senator...



(CROSSTALK)



AUDIENCE MEMBER: ... a better idea!



MCCAIN: That will get the support of enough people so that we can pass legislation.



This isn't the bill that I would have written, but it does...



BLITZER: All right. Thank you.



MCCAIN: ... it does satisfy our national security challenges, which are severe and intense. And we cannot 12 million people washing around America illegally, my friends. (CROSSTALK)



MCCAIN: And I hope you'll examine the legislation.



BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.



MCCAIN: And I hope we can move forward with it. And we can make it better.



BLITZER: All right.



MCCAIN: But it's our job to do the hard things...



BLITZER: Mayor, go ahead.



MCCAIN: ... not the easy things.



(APPLAUSE)



GIULIANI: I've read the 400 pages. And this is part of the problem in Washington: They say things and then it's not in the legislation.



There are four or five different methods of identification, not one.



It does not provide information about who exited the United States. Now, tell me how you're going to figure out who's in the United States if you can't figure out who's left the United States.



And finally, it doesn't provide for a uniform database. Many countries have this. The United States doesn't have it.



On September 11th, when we tried to figure out who was in this country, it took weeks to figure out who were the right people and who weren't, because there isn't such a database. And that is a fatal flaw in this legislation. And wishing it away doesn't make it possible.



(APPLAUSE)



BLITZER: Governor Romney, what would you do with the 12 million or so illegal immigrants who are, right now, in this country?



ROMNEY: Well, one is to enforce the law as it exists. The law that was passed in 1986...



(APPLAUSE)



The law passed in 1986 asked for us to secure the border and said also to put in place an employment verification system.



Neither one of those was done. So let's make sure that we enforce the law as it exists.



And if you want to improve this bill, well, one thing you could do to make it better is to take that Z visa and make it temporary instead of a permanent right to stay in America. That's simply just not fair.



(APPLAUSE)



BLITZER: I want to stay on immigration. Everybody's going to have a chance to weigh in. But let's go back to Tom for another question on immigration.



FAHEY: Congressman Hunter, whether we like it or not, in cities across America, counties across America, including your district in San Diego, illegal immigrants are doing jobs that American citizens don't want, working on farms, in hotels, restaurants.



If you have your way and they all leave this country, who's going to fill those jobs?



HUNTER: Well, first, I disagree with that premise, because when they made the sweep on the Swift plants -- those were the meat- packaging plants in Iowa; took out some 850 people who were working there illegally several months ago -- there were American citizens lined up the next day to get their jobs back at 18 bucks an hour.



And let me tell you, this is a disastrous bill. And John McCain is right in saying that this is a national security issue. And it is: border enforcement.



Then the Hunter bill, which was signed by the president on the 26th of October, mandating 854 miles of double fence -- not that scraggly, little fence you show on CNN all the time, Wolf, that people get across so easily.



If they get across my fence, we sign them up for the Olympics immediately.



(LAUGHTER)



We've got a big fence.



But 854 miles of double border fence was mandated to be constructed. Homeland Security has a billion bucks, cash on hand. It's been six months, and they've done 11 miles.



So this administration has a case of the slows. And I think they slowed the fence down so that they could come out with the amnesty at the same time, put the two together, and the Bush-McCain-Kennedy bill would then be accepted by conservatives and liberals alike.



It's a bad bill.



BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.



(APPLAUSE)



Senator Brownback, what do you say about this notion of a pathway toward citizenship for these 12 million illegal immigrants who are in the country right now? Under what circumstances would you let them begin that path?



BROWNBACK: I don't think you create any new paths to citizenship. But I also think you allow them to be able to use paths that they would currently qualify for, and to be able to get in the back of "	0

Scranton, Pennsylvania

2:37 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Scranton! Thank you. (Applause.) It is good to be back in Scranton. Go, Knights! (Applause.) It is good to be here. Thank you, Principal Schaeffer, for letting us hold this little assembly here at the high school. (Laughter.) The principal was bragging about both the basketball team and the football team. I understand theyÃ¢ÂÂre -- (applause) -- right up there? All right.

Thank you, Donna, for the wonderful invitation. We had a chance to visit in the FestasÃ¢ÂÂ living room, and just a wonderful family, and their kids are doing great. So IÃ¢ÂÂm really, really proud to be with all of you.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Can you come to my house? (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: What did she say? You want -- next time, your house. (Laughter.) All right? (Applause.)

Now, I will say, Donna put out some really good cookies. So -- (laughter) -- IÃ¢ÂÂm just saying. (Laughter.) All right.

Now, I also want to bring greetings from somebody you guys know pretty well -Ã¢ÂÂ a guy named Joe Biden. (Applause.) Joe is in Iraq as we speak, and heÃ¢ÂÂs visiting with our brave men and women in uniform, thanking them for their service. (Applause.) And part of the reason heÃ¢ÂÂs going now is because, pretty soon, weÃ¢ÂÂll all get a chance to say thank you. This holiday season is going to be a season of homecomings, because by the end of December, all of our troops are going to be out of Iraq. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre going to be back home. (Applause.)

Now, I mention Joe, first of all, because he loves Scranton. (Applause.) He was born here in Scranton. He spent his early years here in Scranton. This town helped make him who he is. This is a town where he and so many of you grew up with a faith in an America where hard work matters. Where responsibility matters. Where if you stay true to those things, you can get ahead. Where no matter who you are, no matter what you look like -Ã¢ÂÂ whether you own a factory or you work on the factory floor Ã¢ÂÂ- America is a place where you can make it if you try. (Applause.)

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why Joe and I ran for this office. You are why we spent so much time in this state a few years ago. Because even then, those ideas -Ã¢ÂÂ the idea thatÃ¢ÂÂs at the very heart of the American Dream Ã¢ÂÂ- felt like it was slipping away for a lot of people. It was wonderful visiting with Patrick and Donna, and we were talking about the fact that Patrick has been -- Patrick Festa has been teaching in the school system for 25 years now; Donna has been a graphic artist. But theyÃ¢ÂÂre still worried about if the washer/dryer goes out, or if they have to do a car repair. Things are tight. And theyÃ¢ÂÂre pretty lucky that theyÃ¢ÂÂve got a good job, steady jobs. For a lot of folks, itÃ¢ÂÂs a lot tougher.

And weÃ¢ÂÂve gone through a difficult decade for middle-class Americans. More good jobs in manufacturing left our shores over the last decade. More of our prosperity was built on risky financial deals and homes that a lot of folks couldnÃ¢ÂÂt afford. And a lot of you watched your incomes fall or your wages flatline. Meanwhile, the costs of everything from college to health care were all going up. And then, after all that, the financial crisis hit because of the irresponsibility of some on Wall Street. (Applause.) And that made things a whole lot tougher.

Today, we all know folks whoÃ¢ÂÂve spent months looking for work. We all know families making deep sacrifices just to get by. We all know young people who have gone to college, theyÃ¢ÂÂve taken on a bunch of debt. Now theyÃ¢ÂÂre finding that the opportunity that they worked so hard to find is getting harder and harder to come by. So thereÃ¢ÂÂs a sense of deep frustration among people whoÃ¢ÂÂve done the right thing, but donÃ¢ÂÂt see that hard work and that responsibility pay off. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs not the way things are supposed to be, not here in America.

But here today with all of you, IÃ¢ÂÂm thinking about something that is probably JoeÃ¢ÂÂs favorite expression. And some of you know JoeÃ¢ÂÂs story. He went through some tough times when he was a kid. And his father used to tell him, Champ, when you get knocked down, you get up. You get up.

And Scranton, weÃ¢ÂÂve taken some punches these last few years. But thereÃ¢ÂÂs one thing I know about people here in Scranton, people in Pennsylvania, and people all across America: We are tougher than the times. We are America. We get back up. We fight back. We move forward. (Applause.) We donÃ¢ÂÂt give up. We get back up. (Applause.)



And even though our economic problems werenÃ¢ÂÂt caused overnight and so theyÃ¢ÂÂre not going to be solved overnight -- even though itÃ¢ÂÂs going to take a few more years to meet all the challenges that were decades in the making -- weÃ¢ÂÂre fighting to make things right again. WeÃ¢ÂÂre fighting to make sure that if you are working hard and you are carrying out your responsibilities and youÃ¢ÂÂre looking out for your family, that you can live a good, solid, middle-class life. That is what America is all about. And we are going to be fighting for that every day, every week, every month and every year that weÃ¢ÂÂre in office. (Applause.)

We want an America where hard work is valued and responsibility is rewarded. WeÃ¢ÂÂre fighting to rebuild an economy that restores security for the middle class and renews opportunity for folks that are trying to get into the middle class. WeÃ¢ÂÂre fighting to build an economy thatÃ¢ÂÂs not based on outsourcing and tax loopholes and risky financial schemes, but one thatÃ¢ÂÂs built to last -- one where we invest in things like education and small businesses -- (applause) -- an economy thatÃ¢ÂÂs built on manufacturing and building things again and selling them all around the world. (Applause.)

And weÃ¢ÂÂre going to keep fighting to make our economy stronger and put our friends and neighbors back to work, to give our young people opportunities greater than the opportunities that we had. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what weÃ¢ÂÂve been doing for the last three years.

But two months ago, I sent a particular piece of legislation to Congress called the American Jobs Act. (Applause.) This is a jobs bill that will put more Americans to work, put more money back in the pockets of working families. ItÃ¢ÂÂs contains ideas that historically have been supported by Democrats and Republicans. ItÃ¢ÂÂs paid for by asking our wealthiest citizens to pay their fair share. (Applause.) And independent economists said that it would create up to 2 million jobs, and grow the economy by as much as 2 percent. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need right now.

Now, hereÃ¢ÂÂs the problem -- there is a problem. Folks in Washington donÃ¢ÂÂt seem to be getting the message. When this jobs bill came to a vote, Republicans in the Senate got together and they blocked it. They refused to even debate it. Even though polls showed that two-thirds of Americans of all political stripes supported the ideas in this bill, not one single Republican stepped up to say, this is the right thing to do.

AUDIENCE: Booo!

THE PRESIDENT: Not one. But hereÃ¢ÂÂs the good news, Scranton. Just like you donÃ¢ÂÂt quit, I donÃ¢ÂÂt quit. (Applause.) I donÃ¢ÂÂt quit. So I said, look, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to do everything that I can do without Congress to get things done. (Applause.)

So letÃ¢ÂÂs just take a look over the past several weeks. We said, we canÃ¢ÂÂt wait. We just went ahead and started taking some steps on our own to give working Americans a leg up in a tough economy. For homeowners, I announced a new policy that will help families refinance their mortgages and save thousands of dollars. (Applause.) For all the young people out here -- (applause) -- we reformed our student loan process to make it easier for more students to pay off their debts earlier. (Applause.) For our veterans out here -- and I see some veterans in the crowd -- (applause) -- we ordered several new initiatives to help our returning heroes find new jobs and get trained for those jobs. (Applause.) Because you shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have to fight for a job when you come home after fighting for America -- you shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have to do that. (Applause.)

And in fact, last week I was able to sign into law two new tax breaks for businesses that hire veterans, because nobody out here who is a veteran should -- we have to make sure that they are getting the help that they need.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, Mr. President!

THE PRESIDENT: And by the way, I think weÃ¢ÂÂre starting to get, maybe, to the Republicans a little bit, because they actually voted for this veterans bill. I was glad to see that. (Applause.) I was glad that Democrats and Republicans got together with this bipartisan legislation.

Now, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot more to do, though, if weÃ¢ÂÂre going to get every American back to work who wants to work, and to rebuild an economy that works for every American, which is why weÃ¢ÂÂre going to give Congress another chance to do the right thing with the American Job Act. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to give them another chance to help working families like yours. (Applause.)

Last year, both parties came together to cut payroll taxes for the typical household by $1,000. Now, thatÃ¢ÂÂs been showing up in your paychecks each week. You may not be aware of it, because times are tight. But you actually got a tax cut of $1,000 this year. Now, I know you hear a lot of folks on cable TV claiming that IÃ¢ÂÂm this big tax-and-spend liberal. Next time you hear that, you just remind the people who are saying it that since IÃ¢ÂÂve taken office, IÃ¢ÂÂve cut your taxes. (Applause.)

Your taxes today -- the average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office, just remember that. (Applause.) We have cut taxes for small businesses not once, not twice, but 17 times. The average familyÃ¢ÂÂs tax burden is among the lowest itÃ¢ÂÂs been in the last 60 years.

So the problem is not that weÃ¢ÂÂve been raising taxes. WeÃ¢ÂÂve actually been trying to give families a break during these tough times. But hereÃ¢ÂÂs the thing: That payroll tax cut that we passed in December of last year, itÃ¢ÂÂs set to expire at the end of this year, one month from now. If that happens -- if Congress doesnÃ¢ÂÂt act to extend this tax cut -- then most of you, the typical middle-class family, is going to see your taxes go up by $1,000 at the worst possible time. A young lady just said she canÃ¢ÂÂt afford that. It would be tough for you. It would also be a massive blow for the economy, because weÃ¢ÂÂre not fully out of the recession yet. DonÃ¢ÂÂt take my word for it; this is what every independent economist says. We canÃ¢ÂÂt let this tax cut lapse right now.

And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why my jobs bill -- part of the American Jobs Act was to extend this tax cut for another year. In fact, it does one better. It says, letÃ¢ÂÂs expand that tax cut. Instead of a $1,000 tax cut next year, the typical working family under my plan would get a tax cut of $1,500. (Applause.) Instead of it coming out of your paycheck, it would be going into your pocket. Now, thatÃ¢ÂÂs money that you can spend on a small business right here in Scranton. If youÃ¢ÂÂre a small business owner, my jobs bill will cut your payroll taxes in half. So if youÃ¢ÂÂve got 50 employees making $50,000 each, youÃ¢ÂÂd get a tax cut of nearly $80,000. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs money that you can then use to hire some more workers and get this economy moving again. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a good thing. (Applause.)

Now, this really should not be controversial. A lot of Republicans have agreed with this tax cut in the past. The Republican leader in the Senate said it would -- IÃ¢ÂÂm quoting here -- it would Ã¢ÂÂput a lot of money back in the hands of business and in the hands of individuals.Ã¢ÂÂ ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what he said. Another Republican leader said it would help small business owners create jobs and help their employees spend more money, creating even more jobs. One Republican even called it a Ã¢ÂÂconservative approach to help put our economy back on track.Ã¢ÂÂ So whatÃ¢ÂÂs the problem?

The bad news is some of those same Republicans voted Ã¢ÂÂnoÃ¢ÂÂ on my jobs bill and those tax cuts. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know whether itÃ¢ÂÂs just because I proposed it. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know. They said Ã¢ÂÂnoÃ¢ÂÂ to cutting taxes for small business owners and working families. One of them said just two years ago that this kind of tax cut would boost job creation, and now that IÃ¢ÂÂm proposing it, he said we should let it expire. I mean, what happened?

Republicans say theyÃ¢ÂÂre the party of tax cuts. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what they say. A lot of them have sworn an oath to never raise taxes on anybody as long as they live. That doesnÃ¢ÂÂt square with their vote against these tax cuts. I mean, how is it that they can break their oath when it comes to raising your taxes, but not break their oath when it comes to raising taxes for wealthy people? That doesnÃ¢ÂÂt make any sense. (Applause.) I mean, I hope that they donÃ¢ÂÂt want to just score political points. I hope that they want to help the economy.

This cannot be about who wins and loses in Washington. This is about delivering a win for the American people. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what this is about. (Applause.) You know, $1,500 -- thatÃ¢ÂÂs not a Band-Aid for middle-class families, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a big deal. How many people here could use an extra $1,500? (Applause.) Yes, I thought so.

So IÃ¢ÂÂll tell you what, Scranton. They may have voted Ã¢ÂÂnoÃ¢ÂÂ on these tax cuts once. But IÃ¢ÂÂm already filled with the Christmas spirit. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs kind of some chill in the air. I saw some Christmas decorations at the Festas. So IÃ¢ÂÂm in a Christmas spirit. I want to give them another chance. I want to give them a chance to redeem themselves. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to give them another chance.

So as early as Friday, this Friday, in a couple of days, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to give them a chance to take a simple vote on these tax cuts. If they vote Ã¢ÂÂno,Ã¢ÂÂ then the typical familyÃ¢ÂÂs taxes will go up by $1,000 next year. If they vote Ã¢ÂÂyes,Ã¢ÂÂ then the typical family will have an extra $1,500 in their pocket. (Applause.) So letÃ¢ÂÂs just be clear: If they vote Ã¢ÂÂno,Ã¢ÂÂ your taxes go up; vote Ã¢ÂÂyes,Ã¢ÂÂ you get a tax cut. Which way do you think Congress should vote? They should vote Ã¢ÂÂyes,Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs pretty simple.



Now, if you want to see what this vote will mean for your bottom line, we have this spiffy new tax calculator on our Internet site, WhiteHouse.gov. So you can go on there and you can punch in your numbers and figure out what it would mean to your family. But this is real money that would go into the economy at a time it needs it.

Now, I really do think your voices are already getting

through, because some of the folks in Congress are starting to say, well, maybe weÃ¢ÂÂre open to this thing. Maybe weÃ¢ÂÂll be open to these tax cuts. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs good news. But I want to make sure that we do this responsibly. So what IÃ¢ÂÂve said is, to pay for this tax cut, we need to ask wealthy Americans to pay their fair share. (Applause.)

WeÃ¢ÂÂre asking -- what weÃ¢ÂÂve said is letÃ¢ÂÂs ask the folks whoÃ¢ÂÂve seen their incomes rise fastest, whoÃ¢ÂÂve gotten bigger tax breaks under Bush, letÃ¢ÂÂs ask them to help out a little bit, because they made it better through the recession than most of us. LetÃ¢ÂÂs ask them to contribute a little bit more to get the economy going again.

And I just want to point out IÃ¢ÂÂve done pretty well over these last few years. So IÃ¢ÂÂve said, let me pay a little bit more. I promise you, I can afford it. (Laughter.) I really can. WeÃ¢ÂÂre asking people like me to sacrifice just a little bit so that you guys have a little bit of a leg up.



And by the way, let me say this: When you talk to most folks who are making a million dollars a year, they are willing to do more if theyÃ¢ÂÂre asked. Warren Buffett is a good example. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre willing to do more if theyÃ¢ÂÂre asked. (Applause.)

Now, I mean, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to exaggerate. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not like theyÃ¢ÂÂre volunteering. (Laughter.) But if theyÃ¢ÂÂre asked, if they feel like itÃ¢ÂÂs going to help middle-class families, help grow the economy, help to reduce the deficit, theyÃ¢ÂÂre willing to help. I canÃ¢ÂÂt tell you how many well-to-do folks I meet who say, look, America gave me a chance to succeed. Somewhere along the line, somebody gave me a good education. Somewhere along the line, somebody gave me a college scholarship. Somewhere along the line, somebody built the information and transportation networks that have helped my business grow. Somewhere along the line, somebody gave me a shot. And so now itÃ¢ÂÂs my turn to do the next generation that same good thing. IÃ¢ÂÂve got to give something back to them as well. (Applause.)

Because, Scranton, this is something everybody in this audience understands. When you think about the history of Scranton and the immigrants who came here and worked hard, each successive generation doing a little bit better -- you guys know that what America is about is that weÃ¢ÂÂre all in this together; that each of us has to do our own individual part, but we also have to be looking out for one another.

And thatÃ¢ÂÂs the very simple choice thatÃ¢ÂÂs facing Congress right now: Are you going to cut taxes for the middle class and those who are trying to get into the middle class? Or are you going to protect massive tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, many of whom donÃ¢ÂÂt even want those tax breaks? Are you going to ask a few hundred thousand people who have done very, very well to do their fair share? Or are you going to raise taxes for hundreds of millions of people across the country -- 160 million Americans? Are you willing to fight as hard for middle-class families as you do for those who are most fortunate? WhatÃ¢ÂÂs it going to be?

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the choice in front of Congress. And I hope members of Congress think hard about this, because their actions lately donÃ¢ÂÂt reflect who we are as a people. What does it say about our priorities when weÃ¢ÂÂd rather protect a few really well-to-do people than fight for the jobs of teachers and firefighters? (Applause.) What does it say when we -- about our values when weÃ¢ÂÂd rather fight for corporate tax breaks than put construction workers back on the job rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our schools? (Applause.) What does it say about us if weÃ¢ÂÂre willing to cut taxes for the people who donÃ¢ÂÂt need them, and raise them on folks who do need a tax break?

We are better than that. America is better than that. We celebrate individual achievement, we expect everybody to work hard, but we donÃ¢ÂÂt believe in every person for themselves; we believe that out of many, we come together as one. (Applause.) WeÃ¢ÂÂre a people who reach for our own success, but we also reach back for the people -- to bring somebody up. Reach back to help others earn their own success as well. (Applause.) And we believe that if the folks at the bottom and the folks in the middle succeed, then American succeeds, and the folks at the top succeed as well. (Applause.)

The decisions we make today are going to determine whether or not our kids grow up in a country where those values still thrive. And Scranton, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know about you, but I want our kids to grow up -- I want Malia and Sasha and all your kids, I want them to come into a country that is built on those big, generous values -- (applause) -- an America that reflects the values that we inherited from our parents and our grandparents.

So if you agree with me, I need you to tell Congress where your priorities lie. Members of Congress, they work for you. Scranton, youÃ¢ÂÂve got a great senator in Senator Casey. I love Senator Casey. (Applause.)

So I want you to know, Casey is already on the program. (Applause.) But to everybody who is here, everybody who is watching, send your Senate a message -- send your senators a message. Tell them, Ã¢ÂÂDonÃ¢ÂÂt be a Grinch.Ã¢ÂÂ (Laughter.) Ã¢ÂÂDonÃ¢ÂÂt be a Grinch.Ã¢ÂÂ DonÃ¢ÂÂt vote to raise taxes on working Americans during the holidays. Make sure to renew unemployment insurance during the holidays. (Applause.) Stop saying Ã¢ÂÂnoÃ¢ÂÂ to steps that would make our economy stronger. Put our country before party. Put money back into the pockets of working Americans. Do your job. Pass this bill. (Applause.)

Scranton, the American people are with us on this. It is time for folks to stop running around spending all their time talking about whatÃ¢ÂÂs wrong with America. Spend some time, roll up your sleeves, and help us rebuild America. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need to do. (Applause.)

There is nothing wrong with this country that we canÃ¢ÂÂt fix. WeÃ¢ÂÂre Americans, and our story has never been about things coming easy to us. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not what Scranton has been about. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not what Pennsylvania, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not what America is about. ItÃ¢ÂÂs been about rising to the moment, and meeting the moment when things are hard. ItÃ¢ÂÂs about doing whatÃ¢ÂÂs right.

So letÃ¢ÂÂs do whatÃ¢ÂÂs right. LetÃ¢ÂÂs prove that the best days of America are still ahead of us.

God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

337	"A woman in Columbus, Ohio, was arrested, charged and convicted after she hit and killed a 7-month-old baby with her car.

Muhuba Mohamed was found guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide after she struck a man who was pushing an infant in a stroller along the side of the road. Mohamed then crashed into a house.

The man pushing the stroller was identified as 23-year-old Kenan Ferebee, and the child was his 7-month-old son, Micah.

The baby was pronounced dead at an area hospital. The childÃ¢ÂÂs father was taken to a different hospital in critical condition, WBNS reported.

A witness said Mohamed had a phone in her hand at the time of the crash, but there was no evidence of any texts or calls being received at the time. Four days earlier, the woman was in an accident in which she crashed into a median, The Columbus Dispatch reported. In both cases, she was driving on a temporary permit without an accompanying licensed driver.

Ã¢ÂÂNot one of those single things amounts to recklessness,Ã¢ÂÂ Judge Laurel Beatty Blunt said. Ã¢ÂÂBut when you look at the totality of the circumstances, the court does rule that it does amount to reckless conduct.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mohamed, a native of Somalia, reportedly faced a prison sentence if convicted, but was allowed to remain free until her sentencing.

Ã¢ÂÂIf an American did the same thing they would be in jail for a long time,Ã¢ÂÂ one Mad World News reader commented on the siteÃ¢ÂÂs Facebook page. Ã¢ÂÂShe should get the same or more being the 2nd accident in 4 days. Going off the side of the road and running over 2 innocent people killing a helpless baby. Come on people. Give her life in prison. She deserves more than that but IÃ¢ÂÂm sure she wonÃ¢ÂÂt get the death penalty. What in the hell kind of Justice system do we have now.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂDefine for me the difference between reckless conduct and recklessness,Ã¢ÂÂ another wrote. Ã¢ÂÂMaybe in OHIO they speak different English than I do, after all I am from a rural state and may not understand the high English as interpreted by more citified judges. Where is justice? If a Caucasian teenager did thisÃ¢ÂÂ¦ You finish the sentence.Ã¢ÂÂ"	1

(Applause.) There she is. Attorney General Lisa Madigan is here. (Applause.)



I see a bunch of my former colleagues, some folks who I haven't seen in years and I'm looking forward to saying hi to. One in particular I've got to mention, one of my favorites from the Illinois Senate -- John Sullivan is in the house. (Applause.) John was one of my earliest supporters when I was running for the U.S. Senate, and it came in really handy because heÃ¢ÂÂs got, like, 10 brothers and sisters, and his wife has got 10 brothers and sisters -- (laughter) -- so theyÃ¢ÂÂve got this entire precinct just in their family. (Laughter.) And they all look like John -- the brothers do -- so he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have to go to every event. He can just send one of his brothers out. (Laughter.) It is good to see him.



Dick Durbin couldnÃ¢ÂÂt make it today, but he sends his best. And we love Dick. (Applause.) HeÃ¢ÂÂs doing a great job. And weÃ¢ÂÂve got one of my favorite neighbors, the Senator from Missouri, Claire McCaskill, in the house, because weÃ¢ÂÂre going to Missouri later this afternoon. (Applause.)



And all of you are here, and itÃ¢ÂÂs great to see you. (Applause.) And I hope everybody is having a wonderful summer. The weather is perfect. Whoever was in charge of that, good job. (Laughter.)



So, eight years ago, I came here to deliver the commencement address for the class of 2005. Things were a little different back then. For example, I had no gray hair -- (laughter) -- or a motorcade. DidnÃ¢ÂÂt even have a prompter. In fact, there was a problem in terms of printing out the speech because the printer didnÃ¢ÂÂt work here and we had to drive it in from somewhere. (Laughter.) But it was my first big speech as your newest senator.



And on the way here I was telling Cheri and Claire about how important this area was, one of the areas that I spent the most time in outside of Chicago, and how much it represented whatÃ¢ÂÂs best in America and folks who were willing to work hard and do right by their families. And I came here to talk about what a changing economy was doing to the middle class -- and what we, as a country, needed to do to give every American a chance to get ahead in the 21st century.



See, I had just spent a year traveling the state and listening to your stories -- of proud Maytag workers losing their jobs when the plant moved down to Mexico. (Applause.) A lot of folks here remember that. Of teachers whose salaries werenÃ¢ÂÂt keeping up with the rising cost of groceries. (Applause.) Of young people who had the drive and the energy, but not the money to afford a college education. (Applause.)



So these were stories of families who had worked hard, believed in the American Dream, but they felt like the odds were increasingly stacked against them. And they were right. Things had changed.



In the period after World War II, a growing middle class was the engine of our prosperity. Whether you owned a company, or swept its floors, or worked anywhere in between, this country offered you a basic bargain -- a sense that your hard work would be rewarded with fair wages and decent benefits, the chance to buy a home, to save for retirement, and most of all, a chance to hand down a better life for your kids.



But over time, that engine began to stall -- and a lot of folks here saw it -- that bargain began to fray. Technology made some jobs obsolete. Global competition sent a lot of jobs overseas. It became harder for unions to fight for the middle class. Washington doled out bigger tax cuts to the very wealthy and smaller minimum wage increases for the working poor.



And so what happened was that the link between higher productivity and peopleÃ¢ÂÂs wages and salaries was broken. It used to be that, as companies did better, as profits went higher, workers also got a better deal. And that started changing. So the income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical familyÃ¢ÂÂs incomes barely budged.



And towards the end of those three decades, a housing bubble, credit cards, a churning financial sector was keeping the economy artificially juiced up, so sometimes it papered over some of these long-term trends. But by the time I took office in 2009 as your President, we all know the bubble had burst, and it cost millions of Americans their jobs, and their homes, and their savings. And I know a lot of folks in this area were hurt pretty bad. And the decades-long erosion that had been taking place -- the erosion of middle-class security -- was suddenly laid bare for everybody to see.



Now, today, five years after the start of that Great Recession, America has fought its way back. (Applause.) We fought our way back. Together, we saved the auto industry; took on a broken health care system. (Applause.) We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We doubled wind and solar power. (Applause.) Together, we put in place tough new rules on the big banks, and protections to crack down on the worst practices of mortgage lenders and credit card companies. (Applause.) We changed a tax code too skewed in favor of the wealthiest at the expense of working families -- so we changed that, and we locked in tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, and we asked those at the top to pay a little bit more. (Applause.)



So you add it all up, and over the past 40 months, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs. This year, weÃ¢ÂÂre off to our strongest private sector job growth since 1999.



And because we bet on this country, suddenly foreign companies are, too. Right now, more of HondaÃ¢ÂÂs cars are made in America than anyplace else on Earth. (Applause.) Airbus, the European aircraft company, theyÃ¢ÂÂre building new planes in Alabama. (Applause.) And American companies like Ford are replacing outsourcing with insourcing -- theyÃ¢ÂÂre bringing jobs back home. (Applause.)



We sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth. WeÃ¢ÂÂre about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from abroad for the first time in nearly 20 years. (Applause.) The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years. (Applause.) And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. (Applause.)



So thanks to the grit and resilience and determination of the American people -- of folks like you -- weÃ¢ÂÂve been able to clear away the rubble from the financial crisis. We started to lay a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. And it's happening in our own personal lives as well, right? A lot of us tightened our belts, shed debt, maybe cut up a couple of credit cards, refocused on those things that really matter.



As a country, weÃ¢ÂÂve recovered faster and gone further than most other advanced nations in the world. With new American revolutions in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care, we're actually poised to reverse the forces that battered the middle class for so long, and start building an economy where everyone who works hard can get ahead.



But -- and here's the big Ã¢ÂÂbutÃ¢ÂÂ -- IÃ¢ÂÂm here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do. Even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, nearly all the income gains of the past 10 years have continued to flow to the top 1 percent. The average CEO has gotten a raise of nearly 40 percent since 2009. The average American earns less than he or she did in 1999. And companies continue to hold back on hiring those whoÃ¢ÂÂve been out of work for some time.



Today, more students are earning their degree, but soaring costs saddle them with unsustainable debt. Health care costs are slowing down, but a lot of working families havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen any of those savings yet. The stock market rebound helped a lot of families get back much of what they had lost in their 401(k)s, but millions of Americans still have no idea how theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to be able to retire.



So in many ways, the trends that I spoke about here in 2005 -- eight years ago -- the trend of a winner-take-all economy where a few are doing better and better and better, while everybody else just treads water -- those trends have been made worse by the recession. And that's a problem.



This growing inequality not just of result, inequality of opportunity -- this growing inequality is not just morally wrong, itÃ¢ÂÂs bad economics. Because when middle-class families have less to spend, guess what, businesses have fewer consumers. When wealth concentrates at the very top, it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy. When the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther and farther apart, it undermines the very essence of America -- that idea that if you work hard you can make it here.



And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why reversing these trends has to be WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂs highest priority. (Applause.) It has to be Washington's highest priority. (Applause.) ItÃ¢ÂÂs certainly my highest priority. (Applause.)



Unfortunately, over the past couple of years, in particular, Washington hasnÃ¢ÂÂt just ignored this problem; too often, Washington has made things worse. (Applause.)



And I have to say that -- because I'm looking around the room -- I've got some friends here not just who are Democrats, I've got some friends here who are Republicans -- (applause) -- and I worked with in the state legislature and they did great work. But right now, what weÃ¢ÂÂve got in Washington, we've seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest that they wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up. And that fiasco harmed a fragile recovery in 2011 and we can't afford to repeat that.



Then, rather than reduce our deficits with a scalpel -- by cutting out programs we donÃ¢ÂÂt need, fixing ones that we do need that maybe are in need of reform, making government more efficient -- instead of doing that, we've got folks whoÃ¢ÂÂve insisted on leaving in place a meat cleaver called the sequester that's cost jobs. It's harmed growth. It's hurt our military. It's gutted investments in education and science and medical research. (Applause.)



Almost every credible economist will tell you it's been a huge drag on this recovery. And it means that we're underinvesting in the things that this country needs to make it a magnet for good jobs.



Then, over the last six months, this gridlock has gotten worse. I didn't think that was possible. (Laughter.) The good news is a growing number of Republican senators are looking to join their Democratic counterparts and try to get things done in the Senate. So that's good news. (Applause.) For example, they worked together on an immigration bill that economists say will boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars, strengthen border security, make the system work.



But you've got a faction of Republicans in the House who wonÃ¢ÂÂt even give that bill a vote. And that same group gutted a farm bill that AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs farmers depend on, but also America's most vulnerable children depend on.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: Booo --



THE PRESIDENT: And if you ask some of these folks, some of these folks mostly in the House, about their economic agenda how it is that they'll strengthen the middle class, theyÃ¢ÂÂll shift the topic to Ã¢ÂÂout-of-control government spendingÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ- despite the fact that we've cut the deficit by nearly half as a share of the economy since I took office. (Applause.)



Or theyÃ¢ÂÂll talk about government assistance for the poor, despite the fact that theyÃ¢ÂÂve already cut early education for vulnerable kids. They've already cut insurance for people whoÃ¢ÂÂve lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Or theyÃ¢ÂÂll bring up Obamacare -- this is tried and true -- despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery when there was no Obamacare. (Applause.)



AUDIENCE MEMBER: My daughter has insurance now!



THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what this is about. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what this is about. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we've been fighting for.



But with this endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball. And I am here to say this needs to stop. (Applause.) This needs to stop.



This moment does not require short-term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates. Our focus has to be on the basic economic issues that matter most to you, the people we represent. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we have to spend our time on and our energy on and our focus on. (Applause.)



And as Washington prepares to enter another budget debate, the stakes for our middle class and everybody who is fighting to get into the middle class could not be higher. The countries that are passive in the face of a global economy, those countries will lose the competition for good jobs. They will lose the competition for high living standards. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why America has to make the investments necessary to promote long-term growth and shared prosperity -- rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, upgrading our transportation systems, upgrading our information networks. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need to be talking about. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what Washington needs to be focused on.



And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why, over the next several weeks, in towns across this country, I will be engaging the American people in this debate. (Applause.) I'll lay out my ideas for how we build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America, and what it takes to work your way into the middle class in America: Job security, with good wages and durable industries. A good education. A home to call your own. Affordable health care when you get sick. (Applause.) A secure retirement even if youÃ¢ÂÂre not rich. Reducing poverty. Reducing inequality. Growing opportunity. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need right now. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need to be focused on. (Applause.)



Now, some of these ideas IÃ¢ÂÂve talked about before. Some of the ideas I offer will be new. Some will require Congress. Some I will pursue on my own. (Applause.) Some ideas will benefit folks right away. Some will take years to fully implement. But the key is to break through the tendency in Washington to just bounce from crisis to crisis. What we need is not a three-month plan, or even a three-year plan; we need a long-term American strategy, based on steady, persistent effort, to reverse the forces that have conspired against the middle class for decades. That has to be our project. (Applause.)



Now, of course, weÃ¢ÂÂll keep pressing on other key priorities. I want to get this immigration bill done. We still need to work on reducing gun violence. (Applause.) WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to continue to end the war in Afghanistan, rebalance our fight against al Qaeda. (Applause.) We need to combat climate change. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to standing up for civil rights. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to stand up for womenÃ¢ÂÂs rights. (Applause.)



So all those issues are important, and weÃ¢ÂÂll be fighting on every one of those issues. But if we donÃ¢ÂÂt have a growing, thriving middle class then we wonÃ¢ÂÂt have the resources to solve a lot of these problems. We wonÃ¢ÂÂt have the resolve, the optimism, the sense of unity that we need to solve many of these other issues.



Now, in this effort, I will look to work with Republicans as well as Democrats wherever I can. And I sincerely believe that there are members of both parties who understand this moment, understand whatÃ¢ÂÂs at stake, and I will welcome ideas from anybody across the political spectrum. But I will not allow gridlock, or inaction, or willful indifference to get in our way. (Applause.)



That means whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, IÃ¢ÂÂll use it. (Applause.) Where I canÃ¢ÂÂt act on my own and Congress isnÃ¢ÂÂt cooperating, IÃ¢ÂÂll pick up the phone -- IÃ¢ÂÂll call CEOs; IÃ¢ÂÂll call philanthropists; IÃ¢ÂÂll call college presidents; IÃ¢ÂÂll call labor leaders. IÃ¢ÂÂll call anybody who can help -- and enlist them in our efforts. (Applause.)



Because the choices that we, the people, make right now will determine whether or not every American has a fighting chance in the 21st century. And it will lay the foundation for our childrenÃ¢ÂÂs future, our grandchildrenÃ¢ÂÂs future, for all Americans.

So let me give you a quick preview of what IÃ¢ÂÂll be fighting for and why. The first cornerstone of a strong, growing middle class has to be, as I said before, an economy that generates more good jobs in durable, growing industries. That's how this area was built. That's how America prospered. Because anybody who was willing to work, they could go out there and they could find themselves a job, and they could build a life for themselves and their family.



Now, over the past four years, for the first time since the 1990s, the number of American manufacturing jobs has actually gone up instead of down. That's the good news. (Applause.) But we can do more. So IÃ¢ÂÂm going to push new initiatives to help more manufacturers bring more jobs back to the United States. (Applause.) WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue to focus on strategies to make sure our tax code rewards companies that are not shipping jobs overseas, but creating jobs right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)



We want to make sure that -- weÃ¢ÂÂre going to create strategies to make sure that good jobs in wind and solar and natural gas that are lowering costs and, at the same time, reducing dangerous carbon pollution happen right here in the United States. (Applause.)



And something that Cheri and I were talking about on the way over here -- IÃ¢ÂÂm going to be pushing to open more manufacturing innovation institutes that turn regions left behind by global competition into global centers of cutting-edge jobs. So letÃ¢ÂÂs tell the world that America is open for business. (Applause.) I know thereÃ¢ÂÂs an old site right here in Galesburg, over on Monmouth Boulevard -- letÃ¢ÂÂs put some folks to work. (Applause.)



Tomorrow, IÃ¢ÂÂll also visit the Port of Jacksonville, Florida to offer new ideas for doing what America has always done best, which is building things. Pat and I were talking before I came -- backstage -- Pat Quinn -- he was talking about how I came over the Don Moffitt Bridge. (Applause.) But weÃ¢ÂÂve got work to do all across the country. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got ports that arenÃ¢ÂÂt ready for the new supertankers that are going to begin passing through the new Panama Canal in two yearsÃ¢ÂÂ time. If we donÃ¢ÂÂt get that done, those tankers are going to go someplace else. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got more than 100,000 bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare. (Laughter and applause.)



Businesses depend on our transportation systems, on our power grids, on our communications networks. And rebuilding them creates good-paying jobs right now that canÃ¢ÂÂt be outsourced. (Applause.)



And by the way, this isnÃ¢ÂÂt a Democratic idea. Republicans built a lot of stuff. This is the Land of Lincoln. Lincoln was all about building stuff -- first Republican President. (Applause.) And yet, as a share of our economy, we invest less in our infrastructure than we did two decades ago. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs inefficient at a time when itÃ¢ÂÂs as cheap as itÃ¢ÂÂs been since the 1950s to build things. ItÃ¢ÂÂs inexcusable at a time when so many of the workers who build stuff for a living are sitting at home waiting for a call.



The longer we put this off, the more expensive it will be and the less competitive we will be. Businesses of tomorrow will not locate near old roads and outdated ports. TheyÃ¢ÂÂll relocate to places with high-speed Internet, and high-tech schools, and systems that move air and auto traffic faster, and not to mention will get parents home quicker from work because weÃ¢ÂÂll be eliminating some of these traffic jams. And we can watch all of that happen in other countries, and start falling behind, or we can choose to make it happen right here, in the United States. (Applause.)



In an age when jobs know no borders, companies are also going to seek out the countries that boast the most talented citizens, and theyÃ¢ÂÂll reward folks who have the skills and the talents they need -- theyÃ¢ÂÂll reward those folks with good pay.



The days when the wages for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earnings of somebody who got some sort of higher education -- those days are over. Everybody here knows that. There are a whole bunch of folks here whose dads or grandpas worked at a plant, didnÃ¢ÂÂt need a high school education. You could just go there. If you were willing to work hard, you might be able to get two jobs. And you could support your family, have a vacation, own your home. But technology and global competition, theyÃ¢ÂÂre not going away. Those old days arenÃ¢ÂÂt coming back.



So we can either throw up our hands and resign ourselves to diminishing living standards, or we can do what America has always done, which is adapt, and pull together, and fight back, and win. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we have to do. (Applause.)



And that brings me to the second cornerstone of a strong middle class -- and everybody here knows it -- an education that prepares our children and our workers for the global competition that theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to face. (Applause.) And if you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the 21st century. (Laughter and applause.)



If we donÃ¢ÂÂt make this investment, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to put our kids, our workers, and our country at a competitive disadvantage for decades. So we have to begin in the earliest years. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂm going to keep pushing to make high-quality preschool available for every 4-year-old in America. (Applause.) Not just because we know it works for our kids, but because it provides a vital support system for working parents.



And IÃ¢ÂÂm going to take action in the education area to spur innovation that donÃ¢ÂÂt require Congress. (Applause.) So, today, for example, as we speak, federal agencies are moving on my plan to connect 99 percent of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs students to high-speed Internet over the next five years. WeÃ¢ÂÂre making that happen right now. (Applause.) WeÃ¢ÂÂve already begun meeting with business leaders and tech entrepreneurs and innovative educators to identify the best ideas for redesigning our high schools so that they teach the skills required for a high-tech economy.



And weÃ¢ÂÂre also going to keep pushing new efforts to train workers for changing jobs. So here in Galesburg, for example, a lot of the workers that were laid off at Maytag chose to enroll in retraining programs like the one at Carl Sandburg College. (Applause.) And while it didnÃ¢ÂÂt pay off for everyone, a lot of the folks who were retrained found jobs that suited them even better and paid even more than the ones they had lost.



And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂve asked Congress to start a Community College to Career initiative, so that workers can earn the skills that high-tech jobs demand without leaving their hometown. (Applause.) And IÃ¢ÂÂm going to challenge CEOs from some of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs best companies to hire more Americans whoÃ¢ÂÂve got what it takes to fill that job opening but have been laid off for so long that nobody is giving their rÃÂ©sumÃÂ© an honest look.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: More talent!



THE PRESIDENT: That, too.



IÃ¢ÂÂm also going to use the power of my office over the next few months to highlight a topic thatÃ¢ÂÂs straining the budgets of just about every American family -- and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the soaring cost of higher education. (Applause.) Everybody is touched by this, including your President, who had a whole bunch of loans he had to pay off. (Laughter.)



Three years ago, I worked with Democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollars stopped padding the pockets of big banks, and instead helped more kids afford college. (Applause.) Then, I capped loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly incomes for responsible borrowers, so that if somebody graduated and they decided to take a teaching job, for example, that didnÃ¢ÂÂt pay a lot of money, they knew that they were never going to have to pay more than 10 percent of their income and they could afford to go into a profession that they loved. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs in place right now. (Applause.) And this week, weÃ¢ÂÂre working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because of congressional inaction. (Applause.)



So this is all a good start -- but it isnÃ¢ÂÂt enough. Families and taxpayers canÃ¢ÂÂt just keep paying more and more and more into an undisciplined system where costs just keep on going up and up and up. WeÃ¢ÂÂll never have enough loan money, weÃ¢ÂÂll never have enough grant money, to keep up with costs that are going up 5, 6, 7 percent a year. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to get more out of what we pay for.



Now, some colleges are testing new approaches to shorten the path to a degree, or blending teaching with online learning to help students master material and earn credits in less time. In some states, theyÃ¢ÂÂre testing new ways to fund college based not just on how many students enroll, but how many of them graduate, how well did they do.



So this afternoon, IÃ¢ÂÂll visit the University of Central Missouri to highlight their efforts to deliver more bang for the buck to their students. And in the coming months, I will lay out an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle-class students and their families. It is critical that we make sure that college is affordable for every single American whoÃ¢ÂÂs willing to work for it. (Applause.)



Now, so youÃ¢ÂÂve got a good job; you get a good education -- those have always been the key stepping stones into the middle class. But a home of your own has always been the clearest expression of middle-class security. For most families, thatÃ¢ÂÂs your biggest asset. For most families, thatÃ¢ÂÂs where your lifeÃ¢ÂÂs work has been invested. And that changed during the crisis, when we saw millions of middle-class families experience their home values plummeting. The good news is over the past four years, weÃ¢ÂÂve helped more responsible homeowners stay in their homes. And today, sales are up and prices are up, and fewer Americans see their homes underwater.



But weÃ¢ÂÂre not done yet. The key now is to encourage homeownership that isnÃ¢ÂÂt based on unrealistic bubbles, but instead is based on a solid foundation, where buyers and lenders play by the same set of rules, rules that are clear and transparent and fair.



So already, IÃ¢ÂÂve asked Congress to pass a really good, bipartisan idea -- one that was championed, by the way, by Mitt RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs economic advisor -- and this is the idea to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage while rates are still low so they can save thousands of dollars a year. (Applause.) It will be like a tax cut for families who can refinance.



IÃ¢ÂÂm also acting on my own to cut red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but the bank is saying no. WeÃ¢ÂÂll work with both parties to turn the page on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and build a housing finance system thatÃ¢ÂÂs rock-solid for future generations.



So weÃ¢ÂÂve got more work to do to strengthen homeownership in this country. But along with homeownership, the fourth cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in this country is a secure retirement. (Applause.) I hear from too many people across the country, face to face or in letters that they send me, that they feel as if retirement is just receding from their grasp. ItÃ¢ÂÂs getting farther and farther away. They can't see it.



Now, today, a rising stock market has millions of retirement balances going up, and some of the losses that had taken place during the financial crisis have been recovered. But we still live with an upside-down system where those at the top, folks like me, get generous tax incentives to save, while tens of millions of hardworking Americans who are struggling, they get none of those breaks at all. So as we work to reform our tax code, we should find new ways to make it easier for workers to put away money, and free middle-class families from the fear that they won't be able to retire. (Applause.)



And if Congress is looking for a bipartisan place to get started, I should just say they donÃ¢ÂÂt have to look far. We mentioned immigration reform before. Economists show that immigration reform makes undocumented workers pay their full share of taxes, and that actually shores up the Social Security system for years. So we should get that done. (Applause.)



Good job; good education for your kids; home of your own; secure retirement.



Fifth, I'm going to keep focusing on health care -- (applause) -- because middle-class families and small business owners deserve the security of knowing that neither an accident or an illness is going to threaten the dreams that youÃ¢ÂÂve worked a lifetime to build.



As we speak, we're well on our way to fully implementing the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) We're going to implement it. Now, if youÃ¢ÂÂre one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance either through the job or Medicare or Medicaid, you donÃ¢ÂÂt have to do anything, but you do have new benefits and better protections than you did before. You may not know it, but you do. Free checkups, mammograms, discounted medicines if you're on Medicare -- thatÃ¢ÂÂs what the Affordable Care Act means. You're already getting a better deal. No lifetime limits.



If you donÃ¢ÂÂt have health insurance, then starting on October 1st, private plans will actually compete for your business, and you'll be able to comparison-shop online. There will be a marketplace online, just like youÃ¢ÂÂd buy a flat-screen TV or plane tickets or anything else you're doing online, and you'll be able to buy an insurance package that fits your budget and is right for you.



And if you're one of the up to half of all Americans whoÃ¢ÂÂve been sick or have a preexisting condition -- if you look at this auditorium, about half of you probably have a preexisting condition that insurance companies could use to not give you insurance if you lost your job or lost your insurance -- well, this law means that beginning January 1st, insurance companies will finally have to cover you and charge you the same rates as everybody else, even if you have a preexisting condition. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what the Affordable Care Act does. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what it does. (Applause.)



Now, look, I know because I've been living it that there are folks out there who are actively working to make this law fail. And I donÃ¢ÂÂt always understand exactly what their logic is here, why they think giving insurance to folks who donÃ¢ÂÂt have it and making folks with insurance a little more secure, why they think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a bad thing. But despite the politically motivated misinformation campaign, the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down.

Over the month, the number of hires and total separations changed little at 5.9 million and 5.5 million, respectively. Within separations, quits (3.7 million) and layoffs and discharges (1.5 million) changed little. This release includes estimates of the number and rate of job openings, hires, and separations for the total nonfarm sector, by industry, and by establishment size class. Job Openings On the last business day of September, the number of job openings changed little at 9.6 million, and the rate was unchanged at 5.7 percent. Over the month, job openings increased in accommodation and food services (+141,000) and in arts, entertainment, and recreation (+39,000). Job openings decreased in other services (-124,000), federal government (-43,000), and information (-41,000). (See table 1.) Hires In September, the number of hires changed little at 5.9 million, and the rate was 3.7 percent for the third month in a row. The number of hires changed little in all industries. (See table 2.) Separations Total separations include quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations. Quits are generally voluntary separations initiated by the employee. The quits rate can serve as a measure of workersÃ¢ÂÂ willingness or ability to leave jobs. Layoffs and discharges are involuntary separations initiated by the employer. Other separations include separations due to retirement, death, disability, and transfers to other locations of the same firm. The number and rate of total separations in September changed little at 5.5 million and 3.5 percent, respectively. Over the month, the number of total separations decreased in state and local government education (-42,000) and in nondurable goods manufacturing (-37,000) but increased in federal government (+8,000). (See table 3.) In September, the number of quits changed little at 3.7 million, and the rate was 2.3 percent for the 3rd consecutive month. The number of quits increased in information (+24,000) but decreased in state and local government, excluding education (-15,000). (See table 4.) In September, the number and rate of layoffs and discharges changed little at 1.5 million and 1.0 percent, respectively. The number of layoffs and discharges decreased in state and local government education (-22,000). (See table 5.) The number of other separations changed little in September at 352,000. (See table 6.) Establishment Size Class In September, the job openings, hires, and total separations rates changed little for establishments with 1 to 9 employees. The job openings rate decreased for establishments with 5,000 or more employees. (See table 7.) ____________ The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey estimates for October 2023 are scheduled to be released on Tuesday, December 5, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. (ET).

Technical Note This news release presents statistics from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The JOLTS program provides information on labor demand and turnover. Additional information about the JOLTS program can be found at www.bls.gov/jlt/. Estimates are published for job openings, hires, quits, layoffs and discharges, other separations, and total separations. The JOLTS program covers all private nonfarm establishments, as well as civilian federal, state, and local government entities in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Starting with data for January 2023, industries are classified in accordance with the 2022 North American Industry Classification System. Definitions Employment. Employment includes persons on the payroll who worked or received pay for the pay period that includes the 12th day of the reference month. Full-time, part-time, permanent, short-term, seasonal, salaried, and hourly employees are included, as are employees on paid vacation or other paid leave. Proprietors or partners of unincorporated businesses, unpaid family workers, employees on strike for the entire pay period, and employees on leave without pay for the entire pay period are not counted as employed. Employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, and consultants are counted by their employer of record, not by the establishment where they are working. JOLTS does not publish employment estimates but uses the reported employment for validation of the other reported data elements. Job Openings. Job openings include all positions that are open on the last business day of the reference month. A job is open only if it meets all three of these conditions: * A specific position exists, and there is work available for that position. The position can be full-time or part-time, and it can be permanent, short-term, or seasonal. * The job could start within 30 days, whether or not the employer can find a suitable candidate during that time. * The employer is actively recruiting workers from outside the establishment to fill the position. Active recruiting means that the establishment is taking steps to fill a position. It may include advertising in newspapers, on television, or on the radio; posting internet notices, posting Ã¢ÂÂhelp wantedÃ¢ÂÂ signs, networking or making Ã¢ÂÂword-of-mouthÃ¢ÂÂ announcements; accepting applications; interviewing candidates; contacting employment agencies; or soliciting employees at job fairs, state or local employment offices, or similar sources. Excluded are positions open only to internal transfers, promotions or demotions, or recall from layoffs. Also excluded are openings for positions with start dates more than 30 days in the future; positions for which employees have been hired but have not yet reported for work; and positions to be filled by employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, or consultants. The job openings rate is computed by dividing the number of job openings by the sum of employment and job openingsÃ¢ÂÂthat is, all filled and unfilled jobsÃ¢ÂÂand multiplying that quotient by 100. Hires. Hires include all additions to the payroll during the entire reference month, including newly hired and rehired employees; full-time and part-time employees; permanent, short-term, and seasonal employees; employees who were recalled to a job at the location following a layoff (formal suspension from pay status) lasting more than 7 days; on-call or intermittent employees who returned to work after having been formally separated; workers who were hired and separated during the month, and transfers from other locations. Excluded are transfers or promotions within the reporting location, employees returning from strike, employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, or consultants. The hires rate is computed by dividing the number of hires by employment and multiplying that quotient by 100. Separations. Separations include all separations from the payroll during the entire reference month and is reported by type of separation: quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations. Quits include employees who left voluntarily, with the exception of retirements or transfers to other locations. Layoffs and discharges includes involuntary separations initiated by the employer, including layoffs with no intent to rehire; layoffs (formal suspensions from pay status) lasting or expected to last more than 7 days; discharges resulting from mergers, downsizing, or closings; firings or other discharges for cause; terminations of permanent or short-term employees; and terminations of seasonal employees (whether or not they are expected to return the next season). Other separations include retirements, transfers to other locations, separations due to employee disability, and deaths. Excluded from separations measures are transfers within the same location; employees on strike; and employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, or consultants. The separations rate is computed by dividing the number of separations by employment and multiplying that quotient by 100. The quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations rates are computed similarly. Estimation Method The JOLTS survey design is a stratified random sample of approximately 21,000 nonfarm business and government establishments. The sample is stratified by ownership, region, industry sector, and establishment size class. The sampling frame is made up of establishments from two sources: the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program (QCEW) and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). The QCEW database contains establishments that cover approximately 95 percent of nonfarm payroll jobs in the United States. This database is a compilation of administrative data from state unemployment insurance (UI) programs and federal government establishments covered by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. A frame of railroad establishments is provided by the FRA. This is added to the QCEW database to complete the JOLTS sampling frame. The JOLTS estimation method involves the following processes: unit nonresponse adjustment, item nonresponse adjustment, monthly benchmarking and estimation, automatic outlier detection, birth and death model estimation, estimates review and outlier selection, alignment, seasonal adjustment, and variance estimates. Establishment size class levels are also produced. Detailed information about the estimation method can be found in the Handbook of Methods at https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/jlt/home.htm. Monthly benchmarking is the process through which the JOLTS weighted employment for each estimation cell is adjusted. JOLTS estimation cells are benchmarked monthly to the current employment level from the BLS Current Employment Statistics (CES) program. The sampled weight is benchmarked to ensure that JOLTS weighted employment is equal to CES employment. Birth/death model. The time lag from the start up, or birth, of an establishment until its appearance on the sampling frame is approximately one year. In addition, many new establishments fail within the first year, referred to as a death. Because new and short-lived universe establishments cannot be reflected in the sampling frame immediately, the JOLTS sample cannot capture job openings, hires, and separations from these establishments during their early existence. BLS has developed a birth/death model that uses establishment birth and death activity from previous years as collected by the QCEW and projects forward to the present using over-the-year change in the CES. The birth/death model also uses historical JOLTS data to calculate the amount of churn (meaning the rates of hires and separations) that exists in establishments of various sizes. The model then combines the calculated churn with the projected employment change to estimate the number of hires and separations that take place in these establishments that cannot be measured through sampling. The estimates of job openings, hires, and separations produced by the birth/death model are added to the sample-based estimates produced from the survey to arrive at the estimates for job openings, hires, and separations. Alignment. The JOLTS figure for hires minus separations can be used to derive a measure of net employment change. This change should be comparable to the net employment change from the much larger CES survey. However, definitional differences between the two surveys, as well as sampling and nonsampling errors, historically caused JOLTS to diverge from CES over time. To limit the divergence and improve the quality of the JOLTS hires and separations series, BLS implemented the monthly alignment method. There are four steps to this method: seasonally adjust, align, back out the seasonal adjustment factors, and seasonally adjust again. Seasonal adjustment. After alignment, the seasonal adjustment program (X-13ARIMA-SEATS) is used to seasonally adjust the JOLTS series. Each month, a concurrent seasonal adjustment methodology uses all relevant data, up to and including the current month, to calculate new seasonal adjustment factors. Moving averages are used as seasonal filters in seasonal adjustment. JOLTS seasonal adjustment includes both additive and multiplicative models, as well as regression with autocorrelated errors (REGARIMA) modeling, to improve the seasonal adjustment factors at the beginning and end of the series and to detect and adjust for outliers in the series. Annual estimates and benchmarking. The JOLTS estimates are revised annually with the issuance of data for January. Five years of data are subject to revision. The revised estimates incorporate: 1) benchmarks based on CES employment estimates newly benchmarked to QCEW, 2) revised seasonal adjustment factors, and 3) any needed special adjustments. The JOLTS employment levels are ratio-adjusted to the CES employment levels, and the resulting ratios are applied to all JOLTS data elements. The seasonally adjusted estimates are recalculated for the most recent 5 years to reflect updated seasonal adjustment factors. These annual updates result in revisions to both the seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted JOLTS data series for the period since the last benchmark was established. Annual levels for hires, quits, layoffs and discharges, other separations, and total separations are the sum of the 12 published monthly levels. Annual average levels for job openings are calculated by dividing the sum of the 12 published monthly levels by 12. Annual average rates for hires, quits, layoffs and discharges, other separations, and total separations are calculated by dividing the sum of the 12 monthly JOLTS published levels for each data element by the sum of the 12 monthly CES published employment levels, and multiplying that quotient by 100. Annual average rates for job openings are calculated by dividing the sum of the 12 monthly JOLTS published levels by the sum of the 12 monthly CES published employment levels plus the sum of the 12 monthly job openings levels, and multiplying that quotient by 100. Reliability of the estimates JOLTS estimates are subject to two types of error: sampling error and nonsampling error. Sampling error can result when a sample, rather than an entire population, is surveyed. There is a chance that the sample estimates may differ from the true population values they represent. The exact difference, or sampling error, varies with the sample selected, and this variability is measured by the standard error of the estimate. BLS analyses are generally conducted at the 90-percent level of confidence. This means that there is a 90-percent chance that the true population mean will fall into the interval created by the sample mean plus or minus 1.65 standard errors. Estimates of median standard errors are released monthly as part of the significant change tables on the JOLTS webpage. Standard errors are updated annually with the most recent 5 years of data. Sampling error estimates are available at www.bls.gov/jlt/jolts_median_standard_errors.htm. Nonsampling error can occur for many reasons, including the failure to include a segment of the population, the inability to obtain data from all units in the sample, the inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide data on a timely basis, mistakes made by respondents, errors made in the collection or processing of the data, and errors from the employment benchmark data used in estimation. The JOLTS program uses quality control procedures to reduce nonsampling error in the surveyÃ¢ÂÂs design.

342	"Comedian Kevin Hart in critical condition after a single-car accident in Summerlin, Las Vegas Monday morning.

According to the police, Hart lost control of his car and went off the east side of the road and his car crashed head-on into a guardrail while he was driving at a high speed.

Metro Police said 38-year-old US comedian and film star Kevin Hart, was driving faster than the 25 mph speed limit while going north on Spring Gate Lane about 8:20 a.m today.

The undisputed king of comedy, as at the time of filing this report, remained in critical condition at MountainView Hospital in Summerlin, police can confirm.

Drugs and alcohol were not factors in the crash, police said.

A day before this tragic incident, comedian Kevin Hart posted a candid social media message confessing that he made a Ã¢ÂÂbad error in judgementÃ¢ÂÂ which recently led to an undisclosed individual making an extortion attempt against him.

In an Instagram video, Hart said that, though he had never claimed to be perfect, he had recently put himself Ã¢ÂÂin an environment where only bad things would happenÃ¢ÂÂ.

Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm not perfect, IÃ¢ÂÂm not gonna sit up here and claim that I am in any shape or form, and I made a bad error in judgement,Ã¢ÂÂ he told his followers. Ã¢ÂÂIn doing that, I know IÃ¢ÂÂm going to hurt the people closest to me, who IÃ¢ÂÂve talked to and apologised to, them being my wife and my kids, and you know; itÃ¢ÂÂs a shitty moment.Ã¢ÂÂ

Hart then explained that he had chosen to Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂfess upÃ¢ÂÂ rather than have someone attempt to make Ã¢ÂÂfinancial gain from [his] mistakes. In this particular situation, thatÃ¢ÂÂs was what was attempted.Ã¢ÂÂ"	1
343	"A fake news article said actress Sandra Bullock praised President Donald Trump while telling Hillary Clinton she could leave the United States if she isnÃ¢ÂÂt happy with how things are going.

""Actress Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton: Ã¢ÂÂif you donÃ¢ÂÂt like our president you can leave and never come back again, you are one jealous woman who is nothing to compare with Trump, I hope he will arrest you soon,Ã¢ÂÂ"" said a Dec. 25 headline on Flash 24 Daily.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social networkÃ¢ÂÂs efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that Bullock made the statement about Clinton. The same story has circulated on various websites on Facebook at least since October.

While the headline showed Bullock bashing Clinton, the article itself didnÃ¢ÂÂt include any quotes by Bullock in which she mentioned Clinton or Trump by name.

The article said that the quotes by Bullock came from her press conference for her ""new film,"" Our Brand Is Crisis. One big hint that this is fake news: that movie was released in 2015. In the movie, Bullock played a political consultant drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate.

At a press conference in October 2015 for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans.

""I donÃ¢ÂÂt agree with that at all,"" Bullock said. ""That was not a statement that I can get behind. I donÃ¢ÂÂt agree with that statement.""

The Flash 24 Daily article included some actual quotes by Bullock from that press conference about how her views are influenced by her son. Bullock has adopted two African-American children -- a boy and a girl.

""I would like my rights represented and those of my son Ã¢ÂÂ very selfish views, and I think everyone else has them,"" she says. ""When this film came along, it came along at a time that I was having that internal discussion with myself about who in our country would step out of their comfort zone to help others for the greater good.""

We found no evidence that Bullock said to Clinton ""if you donÃ¢ÂÂt like our president you can leave and never come back again."" We rate this headline Pants on Fire."	1

EspaÃÂ±ol

The current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this yearÃ¢ÂÂs flu Ã¢ÂÂ which may continue to affect Americans into April Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂre already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next seasonÃ¢ÂÂs influenza vaccines.

As part of this process, weÃ¢ÂÂre striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this yearÃ¢ÂÂs influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.

As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.

These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what weÃ¢ÂÂve learned so far about this seasonÃ¢ÂÂs vaccines and the steps weÃ¢ÂÂre taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this yearÃ¢ÂÂs findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.

Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2

There are a number of theories on why this seasonÃ¢ÂÂs vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. WeÃ¢ÂÂre taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.

While that finding isnÃ¢ÂÂt too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.

So why did this seasonÃ¢ÂÂs vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?

We donÃ¢ÂÂt think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this seasonÃ¢ÂÂs flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this yearÃ¢ÂÂs vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.

However, weÃ¢ÂÂre working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this seasonÃ¢ÂÂs vaccines against influenza. We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses.

Working to determine the root causes

Toward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. WeÃ¢ÂÂre also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune systemÃ¢ÂÂs response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging.

What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. WeÃ¢ÂÂre also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this seasonÃ¢ÂÂs vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings.

The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future seasonÃ¢ÂÂs vaccines should be produced.

Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu season

While this scientific work is underway, the composition of next seasonÃ¢ÂÂs flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee meeting March 1, 2018. As is done every year, the FDA convenes this panel to consider the recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the composition of influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere, and to help the FDA select strains for next seasonÃ¢ÂÂs flu vaccines in the U.S. WHO has recommended changing two of the strains currently contained in this yearÃ¢ÂÂs influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere. The upcoming FDA advisory committee meeting will determine if these recommendations should also apply for the U.S. Following that meeting, the FDA will also work to apply all the knowledge that we gain from this yearÃ¢ÂÂs flu season to ensure that the best possible vaccines are available next season to protect against the flu.

In the meantime, this flu season isnÃ¢ÂÂt over yet, though CDC data shows a decline in visits to doctorÃ¢ÂÂs offices and outpatient clinics. We must continue to be diligent in doing our part to prevent the spread of flu however possible, including remembering to wash your hands frequently and staying home when you are sick. ItÃ¢ÂÂs also not too late get vaccinated if you have not yet done so, given that we are starting to see a larger proportion of illnesses caused by H1N1 and B influenza for which vaccines offer better protection. Vaccinations have also been shown to reduce the severity of the flu in people who get sick. People who are very sick with flu-like symptoms and those who are at high risk of serious flu complications should see a healthcare professional as soon as possible to see if they should be treated with antiviral drugs.

The FDA remains committed to determining the root cause for the shortcomings observed in the effectiveness of this seasonÃ¢ÂÂs flu vaccine against H3N2, notifying the public of our work as we gain new insights, and applying what we learn to future vaccine development. Our aim is to make sure we continue to improve the effectiveness of future flu vaccines, and encourage more people to seek vaccination.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nationÃ¢ÂÂs food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

This is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements.

MR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.

Before we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama.

SEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal.

Now, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating.

And as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas. We have to stop providing tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States of America."	0

347	"While we were busy chasing the Ã¢ÂÂS***holeÃ¢ÂÂ not-so-shiny object the press laid out for us on Friday, it is now discovered what the media was trying to distract us from! And it is HUGE!

The DOJ handed down an indictment in the Uranium One Deal released on Friday. THIS is what the media was trying so hard to cover-up. Unlike the leak with Manafort and his indictment (which had nothing to do with Russian collusion in the Trump campaign), America woke up to non-stop news about Manafort turning himself in. Click HERE to read more about that. Manafort has since sued Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Fast forward to today. Uranium One Deal has its FIRST INDICTMENT against Mark Lambert.

Mark Lambert of Maryland has been indicted for Ã¢ÂÂallegedly paid bribes to a Russian Official so his Company could win highly sensitive nuclear fuel transportation contracts.Ã¢ÂÂ

The Ã¢ÂÂ11-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.Ã¢ÂÂ This is serious. And it stems from Russian collusion in the Obama-era.

Ã¢ÂÂThe charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.Ã¢ÂÂ

KUDOS to the Trump-era DOJ AmericanÃ¢ÂÂs can trust.

The hard working and honest DOJ team, under Jeff Sessions, made the announcement yesterday.

The team members are: Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice DepartmentÃ¢ÂÂs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen M. Schenning of the District of Maryland, Principal Deputy Inspector General April G. Stephenson of the U.S. Department of EnergyÃ¢ÂÂs Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) and Assistant Director in Charge Andew W. Vale of the FBIÃ¢ÂÂs Washington, D.C. Field Office, as mentioned in the DOJ statement.

Here is the Statement Below:

An indictment against a former co-president of a Maryland-based transportation company that provides services for the transportation of nuclear materials to customers in the United States and abroad, was unsealed today for his alleged role in a scheme that involved the bribery of an official at a subsidiary of RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs State Atomic Energy Corporation.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice DepartmentÃ¢ÂÂs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen M. Schenning of the District of Maryland, Principal Deputy Inspector General April G. Stephenson of the U.S. Department of EnergyÃ¢ÂÂs Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) and Assistant Director in Charge Andew W. Vale of the FBIÃ¢ÂÂs Washington, D.C. Field Office made the announcement.

Mark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was charged in an 11-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering. The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.

The case against Lambert is assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland.

According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at Ã¢ÂÂTransportation Corporation AÃ¢ÂÂ to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.

In order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments, Lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to Transportation Corporation A, that described services that were never provided, and then Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia, Cyprus and Switzerland. Lambert and others also allegedly used code words like Ã¢ÂÂlucky figures,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂLF,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂlucky numbers,Ã¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂcakeÃ¢ÂÂ to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account.T

he indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation AÃ¢ÂÂs services.

In June 2015, LambertÃ¢ÂÂs former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA. Mikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing. The indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The case is being investigated by DOE-OIG and the FBI. Assistant Chiefs Ephraim Wernick and Christopher J. Cestaro and Trial Attorney Derek J. Ettinger of the Criminal DivisionÃ¢ÂÂs Fraud Section, as well as Assistant U.S. Attorneys David I. Salem and Michael T. Packard of the District of Maryland, are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal DivisionÃ¢ÂÂs Office of International Affairs has provided significant assistance in this matter. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Switzerland, Latvia and Cyprus for providing valuable assistance with the investigation and prosecution of the case.

The Criminal DivisionÃ¢ÂÂs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice DepartmentÃ¢ÂÂs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa."	1

349	"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 Ã¢ÂÂ a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.

Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.

Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.

In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.

The USDAÃ¢ÂÂs Food and Nutrition Service approved FloridaÃ¢ÂÂs request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.

A spokesperson for FloridaÃ¢ÂÂs Department of Children and Families (DCF) Ã¢ÂÂ the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida Ã¢ÂÂ confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.

Ã¢ÂÂThe dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the stateÃ¢ÂÂs administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,Ã¢ÂÂ said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.

Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.

The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.

But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.

The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures Ã¢ÂÂ such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week Ã¢ÂÂ and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.

Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year Ã¢ÂÂ and every year after 2013 Ã¢ÂÂ is continuing."	1
350	"(CNN) -- The McCain campaign calls her a ""tough executive who has demonstrated"" readiness to be president. The Republican National Committee calls her a ""conservative star with the talent, energy and family support necessary to carry out common sense policies.""

John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate came as a surprise. more photos ÃÂ»

But the Obama campaign calls her a candidate with ""the thinnest foreign policy experience in history"" who is ""currently under investigation in her own state."" And one of the Senate's top Democrats, Charles Schumer, said that although she is ""a fine person, her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling.""

What do we know about Sarah Palin, the 44-year-old first-ever female governor of Alaska, wife and mother of five, and now GOP vice presidential nominee?

On August 29, a new part of her identity dominated the political scene: game-changer.

She entered an already historic election, knowing well two of the biggest things McCain needs her to do: shore up votes among social conservatives and win over disaffected Hillary Clinton-supporting Democrats, many of them women. iReport.com: What do you think of McCain's choice of Palin?

Before catapulting to the forefront of U.S. politics, Sarah Palin was, at points along her journey, a beauty queen, high school basketball star and TV sportscaster. More recently, she became known in Alaska as a popular maverick, staunchly conservative on key issues but vocal about problems she saw, including those in her own party. Watch how conservatives say they're thrilled with Palin ÃÂ»

She got the nickname ""Sarah Barracuda"" for her fierce competitiveness on the basketball court in high school. Some of her opponents revived the name after she became mayor of her hometown, Wasilla, in 1996, kicking out a three-term incumbent and butting heads with some city department heads who remained loyal to her predecessor, according to the Almanac of American Politics.

Sarah Palin Born: February 11, 1964, Sandpoint, Idaho Education: B.S., University of Idaho, 1987 Elected offices: Wasilla, Alaska, City Council member, 1992-96

Wasilla mayor, 1996-2002

Elected governor of Alaska, 2006 Professional career: Television sports reporter, 1987-89; co-owner, commercial fishing operation, 1988-2007; owner, snow machine, watercraft and all-terrain vehicle business, 1994-97; chairwoman, Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, 2003-04. Married: To Todd Palin; five children. The oldest, Track, serves in the U.S. Army; the youngest, Trig, has Down syndrome. Sources: Almanac of American Politics, CNN



In 2003 and 2004, she chaired the state Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which regulates Alaska's oil and gas resources.

Widely seen as a political outsider who stayed at arm's length from her party establishment, she defeated two political insiders in 2006 to become the youngest, and first female, governor in the state's history.

As governor, she won praise for backing tough ethical standards for politicians. During the first legislative session after her election, her administration passed a state ethics law overhaul.

But her term was not without controversy. A legislative investigation is looking into allegations that Palin fired Alaska's public safety commissioner because he refused to fire the governor's former brother-in-law, a state trooper. She denied wrongdoing.

An outspoken anti-abortion Republican, Palin has spoken out about her fifth child, who was diagnosed in utero with Down syndrome.

""We knew through early testing he would face special challenges, and we feel privileged that God would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives,"" the Republican National Committee quoted her as saying. ""We have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place. We are truly blessed.""

She is married to her high-school sweetheart, a commercial fisherman. The two eloped in 1988, to save money on a big wedding, a year after she graduated from the University of Idaho, where she studied journalism and political science, according to the Almanac of American Politics. Watch details on elopement ÃÂ»

Palin is an avid hunter and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association.

As millions of Americans began searching for information on her Friday, her official Web site as governor wasn't the only one getting flooded with traffic. Traffic also spiked at sites showcasing pictures from 1984, when she wore the crown of Miss Wasilla and competed in the Miss Alaska contest.

She was born in Idaho, and her parents moved to Alaska when she was 3 months old.

Some similarities between Palin and McCain were clear Friday: Both have been termed mavericks, and both have taken on the GOP establishment at times. McCain has a son who has served in Iraq; Palin has one heading there soon. So does her vice presidential opponent, Sen. Joe Biden.

For all that is known about her, Palin now becomes the most prominent unknown quantity in the presidential race. Her lack of experience on national political issues, including foreign policy and homeland security, and her only brief experience as governor open clear lines of attack for the Obama campaign. Watch Democrats respond to the Palin pick ÃÂ»

Then again, McCain's surprising announcement Friday and the intense focus it drew threatened to slow Obama's post-convention momentum in a dramatic way.

No stranger to being a first in Alaska, Palin now faces being a first on a national level: the first female No. 2 on the GOP presidential ticket and only the second female on a major party ticket, after Democrat Geraldine Ferraro more than 20 years ago.

Schumer described McCain's choice as a ""Hail Mary pass."" Whether that's true has yet to be seen.

But what's not in question is that in entering the race, Sarah Palin changes the game.

Plagued by yet another atrocious season, along with the firing of their head coach, the University of Florida Gators are looking to cancel their annual rivalry game against the Florida State Seminoles.

When asked why they were considering canceling the game, a spokesman for the UF Athletic Department stated, ""Though both programs are struggling this year, dealing with injuries and academic disciplinary action, there is no need in embarrassing the UF Athletic program further by subjecting our already mediocre team to a game that would further humiliate the morale and enthusiasm of our student body.""

353	"Ã¢ÂÂTeeny, teeny,Ã¢ÂÂ said Amy Wilkins, who as vice president at the Education Trust, a civil rights group, has studied the budgets of several of Mr. DuncanÃ¢ÂÂs predecessors. Ã¢ÂÂMargaret was looking for quarters in her pencil drawer.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mr. Duncan said he understood the unusual circumstances.

Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs going to be this extraordinary influx of resources,Ã¢ÂÂ he said in an interview. Ã¢ÂÂSo people say, Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre going to be the most powerful secretary ever,Ã¢ÂÂ but I have no interest in that. Power has never motivated me. What I love is opportunity, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something special, to drive change, to make our schools better.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mr. Duncan said he intended to reward school districts, charter schools and nonprofit organizations that had demonstrated success at raising student achievement ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂislands of excellence,Ã¢ÂÂ he called them. Programs that tie teacher pay to classroom performance will most likely receive money, as will other approaches intended to raise teacher quality, including training efforts that pair novice instructors with veteran mentors, and after-school and weekend tutoring programs.

The stimulus money will help states avert some, but most likely not all, of the education cutbacks for the 2009-10 school year resulting from state budget shortfalls that currently total some $132 billion. California, for instance, is facing a $41 billion budget shortfall, much of it in school spending, but will receive some $11 billion in education money from the stimulus, estimates the National Education Association, the nationÃ¢ÂÂs largest teachers union.

Image Upon meeting department employees last month, Arne Duncan, the new education secretary, asked them to call him by his first name. ÃÂMy name is Arne,ÃÂ he said. ÃÂItÃÂs not Mr. Secretary.ÃÂ Credit... Veronika Lukasova for The New York Times

The positions of deputy secretary, under secretary and chief of staff and dozens of other senior posts at the Education Department remain unfilled, so Mr. Duncan is relying on help from career officers and consultants. He has appointed teams to develop procedures for distributing the stimulus billions quickly, and many aides, he said, have been working evenings and weekends to begin organizing the effort."	0

355	"On Sean Hannity's Fox News show on Nov. 9, 2009, the topic was what the government knew about Fort Hood psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army major who authorities say killed 13 people and wounded 30 others.

""There is a chance our government knew all about this guy Hasan and did nothing because nobody wanted to be called an Islamaphobe,"" Hannity said.

""Now, this is a terrorist act,"" Hannity said. ""What does that say about Barack Obama and our government?""



""Here's the point,"" Hannity said, ""Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism,' because he's apologizing to America in every Muslim country he can.""

We've heard a number of conservative radio and talk show hosts criticize President Obama for not using the ""global war on terrorism"" phrase adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush. And so we decided to check it out.

We did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase ""war on terrorism"" as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. And early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase ""war on terror,"" but only a couple of times.

So what gives? We found two instances where Obama directly addressed the question.

The first was during a Jan. 27, 2009, interview by Hisham Melhem with al-Aribiya, an Arabic-language television news station. Melhem noted that Obama seemed to eschew Bush's phrase ""war on terror"" and ""frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators.""



Obama: ""I think that you're making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name.



""And so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down.



""But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship.""

The issue was again raised in a Feb. 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper:

Cooper: ""I've noticed you don't use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you've only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?""

Obama: ""Well, you know, I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations. But that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds.""

Cooper: ""So that's not a term you're going to be using much in the future?""

Obama: ""You know, what I want to do is make sure that I'm constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life.""

So Obama isn't fond of the phrase ""war on terror."" But did that ever become blanket White House policy?

According to a Washington Post story in March, a memo e-mailed to Pentagon staff members from the Defense Department's office of security review said ""this administration prefers to avoid using the term 'Long War' or ""Global War on Terror.' Please use 'Overseas Contingency Operation.' "" According to the memo, the direction came from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which reviews speeches given by administration officials.

Kenneth Baer, an OMB spokesman, told the Washington Post there was no such guidance, that it was only the opinion of ""a career civil servant.""

Still, you don't hear administration officials using the term ""war on terror,"" or the like, very often.

Obama was criticized in some circles when he failed to even utter the words ""terror"" or ""terrorism"" in a June 4, 2009, speech in Cairo, Egypt, directed to Muslims around the world.

The absence of those words ""goes to the heart"" of Obama's new approach, said John O. Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, who provided perhaps the clearest and most in-depth explanation of the White House lexicon in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Aug. 6, 2009.

""As many have noted, the president does not describe this as a 'war on terrorism.' ... Instead, as the president has made clear, we are at war with al-Qaida, which attacked us on 9/11 and killed 3,000 people. We are at war with its violent extremist allies who seek to carry on al-QaidaÃ¢ÂÂs murderous agenda. These are the terrorists we will destroy. These are the extremists we will defeat.""

Brennan warned that it would be wrong for people to conclude that Obama is not committed to fighting terrorism. ""President Obama has articulated a clear policy Ã¢ÂÂ to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida and its allies,"" Brennan said. ""That is our mission, and the president described it in no uncertain terms in his inaugural when he said, 'Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.' And to win this war against al-Qaida, the administration continues to be unrelenting, using every tool in our toolbox and every arrow in our quiver.""

Our aim here is not to wade into the war of words over the ""war on terror."" Rather, we just wanted to see if Hannity was right that Obama won't use the term ""war on terrorism."" And except in a couple of instances where he used the phrase ""war on terror,"" Obama has generally employed different words. And it's deliberate, as he has explained on several occasions. Obama provides nuanced explanations for his word choices, and you may agree or disagree with them, but the bottom line is that Obama has chosen not to use the phrase ""war on terrorism."" And so we rate Hannity's statement True."	0

359	"U.S. Rep. H. Morgan Griffith is milking his opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency for every last drop.



The Republican stressed his contempt for the agency throughout a heated campaign last fall in which Griffith unseated Democrat Rick Boucher, a 14-term congressman from coal-rich Southwest Virginia. In his victory speech, Griffith vowed to go to Washington and ""fight to rein in the EPA."" Since taking office, he has fired out a barrage of anti-EPA statements.



In a February newsletter to constituents, Griffith claimed that new EPA rules treat milk spills the same way they treat oil spills. He titled the newsletter ""Crying over spilt milk.""



""What do spilt milk and oil have in common?"" he wrote. ""Quite a bit, according to the EPA. In fact, a new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow. The EPAÃ¢ÂÂs reasoning is that milk contains Ã¢ÂÂa percentage of animal fats, which is a non-petroleum oil.Ã¢ÂÂ It appears spilt milk is just as threatening as an oil spill.""



With visions of dairy farmers delicately dabbing milk off the wings of ducks, we looked into the claim.



Beth Breeding, GriffithÃ¢ÂÂs press secretary, said her bossÃ¢ÂÂs information came from the EPAÃ¢ÂÂs website. So we went there.



Right away, we found problems with GriffithÃ¢ÂÂs claim. The website says milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of Republican President Richard Nixon. So this is hardly a ""new ruling,"" as Griffith says. It has been in effect for 38 years.



The EPA site says ""since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of Ã¢ÂÂoilÃ¢ÂÂ from the Clean Water Act, which was authored by Congress.""



The website also notes the rule only applies to farms storing more than 1,320 gallons of oil or milk.



So whatÃ¢ÂÂs new? According to the EPA, the only thing that comes close is a rule change it announced on Jan. 15, 2009. It goes in effect at the end of this month.



The simple purpose of the change is to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the exact opposite of what Griffith claims. HereÃ¢ÂÂs what the regulation says:



""EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade ""A"" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance,"" or similar state laws.



Translated into plain English, the rule means milk storage will no longer have to meet the EPAÃ¢ÂÂs oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws. In Virginia it is illegal to sell ""raw,"" or unpasteurized, milk, so the stateÃ¢ÂÂs dairy farmers should already be in compliance with the new standards.



Raw milk is now legal for sale in 25 states, although 15 of those states only allow sales directly from a farm. So conceivably raw milk producers -- which are almost exclusively small operations, according to a group that advocates for raw milk -- might still need to comply with the SPCC rules. But this would affect only a very small fraction of total U.S. milk.



Baffled by how Griffith could have this claim so mixed up, we went back to his office for additional information. The second time around his press secretary pointed us to a Jan. 27 editorial in The Wall Street Journal that makes virtually the same claim. The editorial wrongly said new EPA rules will apply to dairy farms and cover milk storage. The amended rule only applies to petroleum products -- gasoline, fuel oil and the like -- that are stored in large quantities on dairy farms.



LetÃ¢ÂÂs review our findings.



Griffith claimed a ""new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply"" with strict regulations for spills and leaks. He said the rules were the same as those enforced on oil and natural gas companies.



In fact, these regulations have been in place for 38 years and are not new at all. The ""new ruling"" from the EPA, announced in 2009 and taking effect in a few weeks, actually excludes milk from the spill standards, giving dairy farmers fewer regulations to meet. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the exact opposite of what Griffith claims.



Sure, Griffith got some of his information from an inaccurate editorial in The Wall Street Journal. But a congressman who is railing against a federal agency has the means to get his facts right.



Griffith is dishing udder cow chips. We rate his statement False."	0

THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

_______________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release March 27, 2009



REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

ON A NEW STRATEGY FOR AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN

Room 450

Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building

9:40 A.M. EDT



THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Please be seated.

Before I begin today, let me acknowledge, first of all, Your Excellencies, all the ambassadors who are in attendance. I also want to acknowledge both the civilians and our military personnel that are about to be deployed to the region. And I am very grateful to all of you for your extraordinary work.

I want to acknowledge General David Petraeus, who's here, and has been doing an outstanding job at CENTCOM, and we appreciate him. I want to thank Bruce Reidel -- Bruce is down at the end here -- who has worked extensively on our strategic review. I want to acknowledge Karl Eikenberry, who's here, and is our Ambassador-designate to Afghanistan. And to my national security team, thanks for their outstanding work.

Today, I'm announcing a comprehensive, new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. And this marks the conclusion of a careful policy review, led by Bruce, that I ordered as soon as I took office. My administration has heard from our military commanders, as well as our diplomats. We've consulted with the Afghan and Pakistani governments, with our partners and our NATO allies, and with other donors and international organizations. We've also worked closely with members of Congress here at home. And now IÃ¢ÂÂd like to speak clearly and candidly to the American people.

The situation is increasingly perilous. It's been more than seven years since the Taliban was removed from power, yet war rages on, and insurgents control parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Attacks against our troops, our NATO allies, and the Afghan government have risen steadily. And most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for American forces.

Many people in the United States -- and many in partner countries that have sacrificed so much -- have a simple question: What is our purpose in Afghanistan? After so many years, they ask, why do our men and women still fight and die there? And they deserve a straightforward answer.

So let me be clear: Al Qaeda and its allies -- the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks -- are in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively planning attacks on the United States homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan. And if the Afghan government falls to the Taliban -- or allows al Qaeda to go unchallenged -- that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can.

The future of Afghanistan is inextricably linked to the future of its neighbor, Pakistan. In the nearly eight years since 9/11, al Qaeda and its extremist allies have moved across the border to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier. This almost certainly includes al Qaeda's leadership: Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. They have used this mountainous terrain as a safe haven to hide, to train terrorists, to communicate with followers, to plot attacks, and to send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan. For the American people, this border region has become the most dangerous place in the world.

But this is not simply an American problem -- far from it. It is, instead, an international security challenge of the highest order. Terrorist attacks in London and Bali were tied to al Qaeda and its allies in Pakistan, as were attacks in North Africa and the Middle East, in Islamabad and in Kabul. If there is a major attack on an Asian, European, or African city, it, too, is likely to have ties to al Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan. The safety of people around the world is at stake.

For the Afghan people, a return to Taliban rule would condemn their country to brutal governance, international isolation, a paralyzed economy, and the denial of basic human rights to the Afghan people -- especially women and girls. The return in force of al Qaeda terrorists who would accompany the core Taliban leadership would cast Afghanistan under the shadow of perpetual violence.

As President, my greatest responsibility is to protect the American people. We are not in Afghanistan to control that country or to dictate its future. We are in Afghanistan to confront a common enemy that threatens the United States, our friends and our allies, and the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan who have suffered the most at the hands of violent extremists.

So I want the American people to understand that we have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country in the future. That's the goal that must be achieved. That is a cause that could not be more just. And to the terrorists who oppose us, my message is the same: We will defeat you.

To achieve our goals, we need a stronger, smarter and comprehensive strategy. To focus on the greatest threat to our people, America must no longer deny resources to Afghanistan because of the war in Iraq. To enhance the military, governance and economic capacity of Afghanistan and Pakistan, we have to marshal international support. And to defeat an enemy that heeds no borders or laws of war, we must recognize the fundamental connection between the future of Afghanistan and Pakistan -- which is why I've appointed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who is here, to serve as Special Representative for both countries, and to work closely with General Petraeus to integrate our civilian and military efforts.

Let me start by addressing the way forward in Pakistan.

The United States has great respect for the Pakistani people. They have a rich history and have struggled against long odds to sustain their democracy. The people of Pakistan want the same things that we want: an end to terror, access to basic services, the opportunity to live their dreams, and the security that can only come with the rule of law. The single greatest threat to that future comes from al Qaeda and their extremist allies, and that is why we must stand together.

The terrorists within Pakistan's borders are not simply enemies of America or Afghanistan -- they are a grave and urgent danger to the people of Pakistan. Al Qaeda and other violent extremists have killed several thousand Pakistanis since 9/11. They've killed many Pakistani soldiers and police. They assassinated Benazir Bhutto. They've blown up buildings, derailed foreign investment, and threatened the stability of the state. So make no mistake: al Qaeda and its extremist allies are a cancer that risks killing Pakistan from within.

It's important for the American people to understand that Pakistan needs our help in going after al Qaeda. This is no simple task. The tribal regions are vast, they are rugged, and they are often ungoverned. And that's why we must focus our military assistance on the tools, training and support that Pakistan needs to root out the terrorists. And after years of mixed results, we will not, and cannot, provide a blank check.

Pakistan must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out al Qaeda and the violent extremists within its borders. And we will insist that action be taken -- one way or another -- when we have intelligence about high-level terrorist targets.

The government's ability to destroy these safe havens is tied to its own strength and security. To help Pakistan weather the economic crisis, we must continue to work with the IMF, the World Bank and other international partners. To lessen tensions between two nuclear-armed nations that too often teeter on the edge of escalation and confrontation, we must pursue constructive diplomacy with both India and Pakistan. To avoid the mistakes of the past, we must make clear that our relationship with Pakistan is grounded in support for Pakistan's democratic institutions and the Pakistani people. And to demonstrate through deeds as well as words a commitment that is enduring, we must stand for lasting opportunity.

A campaign against extremism will not succeed with bullets or bombs alone. Al Qaeda's offers the people of Pakistan nothing but destruction. We stand for something different. So today, I am calling upon Congress to pass a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by John Kerry and Richard Lugar that authorizes $1.5 billion in direct support to the Pakistani people every year over the next five years -- resources that will build schools and roads and hospitals, and strengthen Pakistan's democracy. I'm also calling on Congress to pass a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Maria Cantwell, Chris Van Hollen and Peter Hoekstra that creates opportunity zones in the border regions to develop the economy and bring hope to places plagued with violence. And we will ask our friends and allies to do their part -- including at the donors conference in Tokyo next month.

I don't ask for this support lightly. These are challenging times. Resources are stretched. But the American people must understand that this is a down payment on our own future -- because the security of America and Pakistan is shared. Pakistan's government must be a stronger partner in destroying these safe havens, and we must isolate al Qaeda from the Pakistani people. And these steps in Pakistan are also indispensable to our efforts in Afghanistan, which will see no end to violence if insurgents move freely back and forth across the border.

Security demands a new sense of shared responsibility. And that's why we will launch a standing, trilateral dialogue among the United States, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Our nations will meet regularly, with Secretaries Clinton and Secretary Gates leading our effort. Together, we must enhance intelligence sharing and military cooperation along the border, while addressing issues of common concern like trade, energy, and economic development.

This is just one part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent Afghanistan from becoming the al Qaeda safe haven that it was before 9/11. To succeed, we and our friends and allies must reverse the Taliban's gains, and promote a more capable and accountable Afghan government.

Our troops have fought bravely against a ruthless enemy. Our civilians have made great sacrifices. Our allies have borne a heavy burden. Afghans have suffered and sacrificed for their future. But for six years, Afghanistan has been denied the resources that it demands because of the war in Iraq. Now, we must make a commitment that can accomplish our goals.

I've already ordered the deployment of 17,000 troops that had been requested by General McKiernan for many months. These soldiers and Marines will take the fight to the Taliban in the south and the east, and give us a greater capacity to partner with Afghan security forces and to go after insurgents along the border. This push will also help provide security in advance of the important presidential elections in Afghanistan in August.

At the same time, we will shift the emphasis of our mission to training and increasing the size of Afghan security forces, so that they can eventually take the lead in securing their country. That's how we will prepare Afghans to take responsibility for their security, and how we will ultimately be able to bring our own troops home.

For three years, our commanders have been clear about the resources they need for training. And those resources have been denied because of the war in Iraq. Now, that will change. The additional troops that we deployed have already increased our training capacity. And later this spring we will deploy approximately 4,000 U.S. troops to train Afghan security forces. For the first time, this will truly resource our effort to train and support the Afghan army and police. Every American unit in Afghanistan will be partnered with an Afghan unit, and we will seek additional trainers from our NATO allies to ensure that every Afghan unit has a coalition partner. We will accelerate our efforts to build an Afghan army of 134,000 and a police force of 82,000 so that we can meet these goals by 2011 -- and increases in Afghan forces may very well be needed as our plans to turn over security responsibility to the Afghans go forward.

This push must be joined by a dramatic increase in our civilian effort. Afghanistan has an elected government, but it is undermined by corruption and has difficulty delivering basic services to its people. The economy is undercut by a booming narcotics trade that encourages criminality and funds the insurgency. The people of Afghanistan seek the promise of a better future. Yet once again, we've seen the hope of a new day darkened by violence and uncertainty.

So to advance security, opportunity and justice -- not just in Kabul, but from the bottom up in the provinces -- we need agricultural specialists and educators, engineers and lawyers. That's how we can help the Afghan government serve its people and develop an economy that isn't dominated by illicit drugs. And that's why I'm ordering a substantial increase in our civilians on the ground. That's also why we must seek civilian support from our partners and allies, from the United Nations and international aid organizations -- an effort that Secretary Clinton will carry forward next week in The Hague.

At a time of economic crisis, it's tempting to believe that we can shortchange this civilian effort. But make no mistake: Our efforts will fail in Afghanistan and Pakistan if we don't invest in their future. And that's why my budget includes indispensable investments in our State Department and foreign assistance programs. These investments relieve the burden on our troops. They contribute directly to security. They make the American people safer. And they save us an enormous amount of money in the long run -- because it's far cheaper to train a policeman to secure his or her own village than to help a farmer seed a crop -- or to help a farmer seed a crop than it is to send our troops to fight tour after tour of duty with no transition to Afghan responsibility.

As we provide these resources, the days of unaccountable spending, no-bid contracts, and wasteful reconstruction must end. So my budget will increase funding for a strong Inspector General at both the State Department and USAID, and include robust funding for the special inspector generals for Afghan Reconstruction.

And I want to be clear: We cannot turn a blind eye to the corruption that causes Afghans to lose faith in their own leaders. Instead, we will seek a new compact with the Afghan government that cracks down on corrupt behavior, and sets clear benchmarks, clear metrics for international assistance so that it is used to provide for the needs of the Afghan people.

In a country with extreme poverty that's been at war for decades, there will also be no peace without reconciliation among former enemies. Now, I have no illusion that this will be easy. In Iraq, we had success in reaching out to former adversaries to isolate and target al Qaeda in Iraq. We must pursue a similar process in Afghanistan, while understanding that it is a very different country.

There is an uncompromising core of the Taliban. They must be met with force, and they must be defeated. But there are also those who've taken up arms because of coercion, or simply for a price. These Afghans must have the option to choose a different course. And that's why we will work with local leaders, the Afghan government, and international partners to have a reconciliation process in every province. As their ranks dwindle, an enemy that has nothing to offer the Afghan people but terror and repression must be further isolated. And we will continue to support the basic human rights of all Afghans -- including women and girls.

Going forward, we will not blindly stay the course. Instead, we will set clear metrics to measure progress and hold ourselves accountable. WeÃ¢ÂÂll consistently assess our efforts to train Afghan security forces and our progress in combating insurgents. We will measure the growth of AfghanistanÃ¢ÂÂs economy, and its illicit narcotics production. And we will review whether we are using the right tools and tactics to make progress towards accomplishing our goals.

None of the steps that I've outlined will be easy; none should be taken by America alone. The world cannot afford the price that will come due if Afghanistan slides back into chaos or al Qaeda operates unchecked. We have a shared responsibility to act -- not because we seek to project power for its own sake, but because our own peace and security depends on it. And whatÃ¢ÂÂs at stake at this time is not just our own security -- it's the very idea that free nations can come together on behalf of our common security. That was the founding cause of NATO six decades ago, and that must be our common purpose today.

My administration is committed to strengthening international organizations and collective action, and that will be my message next week in Europe. As America does more, we will ask others to join us in doing their part. From our partners and NATO allies, we will seek not simply troops, but rather clearly defined capabilities: supporting the Afghan elections, training Afghan security forces, a greater civilian commitment to the Afghan people. For the United Nations, we seek greater progress for its mandate to coordinate international action and assistance, and to strengthen Afghan institutions.

And finally, together with the United Nations, we will forge a new Contact Group for Afghanistan and Pakistan that brings together all who should have a stake in the security of the region -- our NATO allies and other partners, but also the Central Asian states, the Gulf nations and Iran; Russia, India and China. None of these nations benefit from a base for al Qaeda terrorists, and a region that descends into chaos. All have a stake in the promise of lasting peace and security and development.

That is true, above all, for the coalition that has fought together in Afghanistan, side by side with Afghans. The sacrifices have been enormous. Nearly 700 Americans have lost their lives. Troops from over 20 countries have also paid the ultimate price. All Americans honor the service and cherish the friendship of those who have fought, and worked, and bled by our side. And all Americans are awed by the service of our own men and women in uniform, who've borne a burden as great as any other generationÃ¢ÂÂs. They and their families embody the example of selfless sacrifice.

I remind everybody, the United States of America did not choose to fight a war in Afghanistan. Nearly 3,000 of our people were killed on September 11, 2001, for doing nothing more than going about their daily lives. Al Qaeda and its allies have since killed thousands of people in many countries. Most of the blood on their hands is the blood of Muslims, who al Qaeda has killed and maimed in far greater number than any other people. That is the future that al Qaeda is offering to the people of Pakistan and Afghanistan -- a future without hope or opportunity; a future without justice or peace.

So understand, the road ahead will be long and there will be difficult days ahead. But we will seek lasting partnerships with Afghanistan and Pakistan that promise a new day for their people. And we will use all elements of our national power to defeat al Qaeda, and to defend America, our allies, and all who seek a better future. Because the United States of America stands for peace and security, justice and opportunity. That is who we are, and that is what history calls on us to do once more.

Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

362	"News reports have confirmed that actor Kirk Douglas died of natural causes late this afternoon, Los Angeles coroners office reported. This was just 4 days before he would have turned 101 years old.

Family released a statement saying he Ã¢ÂÂwent comfortably and was in no painÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂlived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.Ã¢ÂÂ

Kirk Douglas was an American actor, producer, director, and author. He was one of the last living people of the film industryÃ¢ÂÂs Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas was well known for his explosive acting style.

As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas had received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he had written ten novels and memoirs. He was No. 17 on the American Film InstituteÃ¢ÂÂs list of the greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, and the highest-ranked living person on the list. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he had focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life. He lived with his second wife (of 63 years), Anne Buydens, a producer. He was to turn 101 on December 9, 2016."	1
363	"August 8, 2010 Ã¢ÂÂ -- AMANPOUR: Good morning. I'm Christiane Amanpour, and at the top of the news this week, ending the war in Iraq.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Tens of thousands of our troops in Iraq are coming home.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: As America stands down, is Iraq ready to stand up? This morning from Baghdad, the commanding general of U.S. forces, General Ray Odierno, a ""This Week"" exclusive.

Then, hidden wounds. After a decade of war, why is the military still so unprepared to deal with its emotional scars?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

(UNKNOWN): They didn't care about my family. The only thing I thought was my role was (inaudible).

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: This morning, the general in charge of healing those wounds, an exclusive interview with the vice chief of staff of the army, General Peter Chiarelli.

Then...

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

(UNKNOWN): We are losing everything we have.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: Jobs, immigration, and gay marriage. All the week's politics on our roundtable with Politico's John Harris; Gillian Tett of the Financial Times; George Packer of the New Yorker, and former Bush White House official Michael Gerson.

And the Sunday Funnies.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

(UNKNOWN): According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, like half of American workers hold on to a job for four years or more. Bad news for President Obama.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: This weekend marks a major milestone in the seven-year war in Iraq. U.S. forces have now handed over control of all combat duties to Iraqi forces, and by the end of this month, all U.S. combat forces will be out. A transitional force of about 50,000 troops will remain, though.

Earlier this week, President Obama spelled out their mission.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

OBAMA: Our forces will have a focused mission -- supporting and training Iraqi forces; partnering with Iraqis in counter-terrorism missions, and protecting our civilian and military efforts. But make no mistake: Our commitment in Iraq is changing from a military effort led by our troops to a civilian effort led by our diplomats.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: But five months after elections, Iraqi politicians have not yet formed a government, and violence continues. Last night, three explosions at a market in southern Iraq killed dozens of people. And today, two car bombs went off west of Baghdad.

Joining me this morning from Baghdad, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, General Ray Odierno. General Odierno, thank you very much for joining us on ""This Week.""

And I want to start by asking you about the handover. You have just handed over all combat operations to Iraqi forces. Are they really ready to stand up once you draw down by the end of this month?

ODIERNO: Well, this is something that we've been working for a very long time with the Iraqi security forces. For the last 20 months, we've been slowly and deliberately turning over more and more responsibility to them, and they have stepped up. They continue to do broad-scoped operations across all of Iraq. We continue to help them as they do these, and that will continue after 1 September, our assistance. But we do believe they are ready to assume full operations in Iraq.

AMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you about the violence. This weekend alone in Basra in the south, there has been a big explosion that's caused dozens of deaths. What is it? Do you know what it is, in fact, was it a terrorist attack?

ODIERNO: Well, I think it probably was. We're still sorting through that, because there was conflicting reports, but my guess is it was probably some sort of an improvised explosive device that went off.

I would just say, this is a reflection -- we have ups and downs here. As I step back, having been here since the dark days of 2006 and '7, to where we are today, what I see is a broad change in the security environment here in Iraq.

However, there are still groups out there who are conducting terrorist acts against the people of Iraq, and they are doing this to stop the political way forward, to stop the political process moving forward, to stop democracy moving forward, and to cause the government of Iraq not to continue its progress. And that's what we're seeing that's playing out on the ground now.

AMANPOUR: Well, General Odierno, in fact, it seems that the political parties in Iraq are not moving forward with the democracy as you describe it. Five months or more after the election, there is still no government. How much does that worry you, and what kind of vacuum is that creating there?

ODIERNO: Well, again, first off, we've seen during this time, this governmental formation timeframe, the Iraqi security forces have acted neutral; they've continued to conduct operations across the broad spectrum of operations that are necessary. In fact, I have found them to be very professional in continuing to execute the security profile. So we have seen no degradation in their ability to execute the security profile. And I think that's actually an extremely positive step forward for them, that they've continued to operate, even though -- or during this time of governmental formation.

AMANPOUR: So, how concerned are you and at what point will you be concerned if there is no government, and do you think that that is providing space for insurgents to reorganize, as many suggest?

ODIERNO: Well, I will just tell you, is what we -- again, what we can't do is overreact to incidents. There are going to be incidents that occur here. There is a level of violence and a level of terrorism here that's going to occur. But I will tell you, over the last six to seven months, the success that we've had against Al Qaida in Iraq specifically in decapitating the leadership has in fact affected them. The kind of operations that they now conduct are very different than what they did just six months ago or eight months ago. And the kind of their ability to surge and do this over a sustained period of time is limited, and that's due to a lot of the work of the Iraqi security forces, working with us to conduct these operations."	0
364	"Early voting began in North Carolina in October, and soon after almost 900 voters aged 112 reportedly cast ballots. In fact in 2008, almost 10,000 108-year olds cast ballots and just over 9,000 110-year olds voted in 2010.

Have this many centenarians actually been voting in North Carolina, or is this a sign of voter fraud as some have asked? Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.

The true explanation is much less exciting.

Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the stateÃ¢ÂÂs voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old."	1
365	"April 25, 2010 Ã¢ÂÂ -- TAPPER: Good morning, everyone. Tomorrow, the Senate is scheduled to hold its first vote on the biggest overhaul in decades of the nation's financial system, changes that could impact your savings, your pension, maybe even your job. This as a big Wall Street investment bank comes under attack on Tuesday. Executives from Goldman Sachs, which is already facing government accusations of fraud, will testify before a Senate committee investigating whether the firm profited from the massive housing crash at the expense of its clients.

Joining me this morning, three key players in the middle of this storm. With me here, is Austan Goolsbee from the President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In Chattanooga, we have Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker, and in Cincinnati, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, both key members of the Senate Banking Committee. Gentlemen, welcome.

GOOLSBEE: Thanks for having us.

CORKER: Good morning. Good to be with you.

TAPPER: Before we start with Wall Street reform, I do want to talk about these Goldman Sachs memos, these emails that the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has released, emails that seem to show executives rejoicing as the housing market crashed, and in fact, they seem to contradict the impression given by Goldman Sachs that they lost money as the mortgage related investment crash happened. In a private email, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote in November of 2007, ""Of course we didn't dodge the mortgage mess. We lost money, then made more than we lost because of shorts.""

Senator Brown, I want to ask you. What do these emails signify to you?

BROWN: Well, these emails signify that there are all kinds of conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that there are -- that Wall Street, while working for its clients and working against its clients in the same sort of bundled toxic securities, and that's why we need the Volcker rule. That's why we need really strong reform that will separate the proprietary trading from banking functions. I think that says it more articulately and more forcefully, that example, than anything we've seen so far.

TAPPER: Senator Corker, doesn't Senator Brown have a point? This is exactly why people think that proprietary trading, that is when a bank uses its own money to invest, should not be the same, it should not be in the same firm as trading for commercial banking, for clients? That there is an inbred conflict of interest there.

CORKER: Well, I can understand the sentiment. I know that certainly the emails do not read well. I look forward to seeing what the SEC investigation brings forth, and the Senate investigation through this subcommittee brings forth. At the end of the day, though, some of that has to do with making markets. I am in no way defending sort of the attitude expressed in the emails, but I think we're better off waiting to see exactly what has taken place.

I think, you know, at the end of the day, instruments are set up on Wall Street. People take either side of it. There are some conflicts of interest that can exist and do need to be looked at, but I'd rather wait and see how this investigation unfolds before making any judgments.

TAPPER: Austan, is there anything in the legislation that Democrats are pushing that President Obama wants to pass, is there anything that would have prevented what Goldman Sachs is accused of having committed?

GOOLSBEE: You know, I don't know the exact details, but there are a number of things that would go directly at the heart of some of these issues that are raised in these cases, like with securitizations, that the people who originate the securities have to maintain some ownership so that if they pack it full of things that are going to fail, they themselves are going to lose money when they do it. I'm certainly not going to comment on independent, you know, regulatory investigations, but these emails that are released, the CEO of Goldman is not going to win any popularity contests when over a period that ordinary Americans' pensions, houses et cetera were collapsing in value, they were actually making significant money off of it. If that's true, I think Senator Brown's point, that we've got to end the conflicts of interest and that the Volcker rule is really on point on that I think is also highly relevant.

TAPPER: Senator Corker, the status of the Wall Street reform bill. Right now, the members of the Senate Banking Committee are negotiating. Tomorrow, the majority leader, Harry Reid, is scheduled to bring it up for a vote. Do you think there will be a bipartisan compromise before that vote happens, and if not, are all 41 Republicans going to stand against proceeding to a debate?

CORKER: Look, first of all, I think everybody knows, Sherrod sure knows I want to see a bill. I think we do need to address regulation in our financial markets. You know, it's in play right now. The fact is, I know that Shelby and Dodd are actually on another program this morning. After that program, I know they're going to continue meeting, hopefully getting to a compromise before tomorrow evening.

And I think what we need to do is have a template. We don't need to address every issue in this compromise, but one that deals with derivatives, one that deals with consumer protection, and one that deals with this orderly liquidation. If we can get that template agreed to in a bipartisan way, then we can debate some of the amendments that Sherrod Brown wants to bring forth, some of the amendments I want to bring forth. But I think it's very, very important that we reach that bipartisan agreement first, because in the Senate, as you know, it takes 60 votes to change anything."	0
366	"May 9, 2010 Ã¢ÂÂ -- TAPPER: Good morning, and a happy Mother's Day to all the moms watching. We'll begin with a Sunday first, Attorney General Eric Holder. Welcome to ""This Week.""

HOLDER: It's good to be here.

TAPPER: Well, let's start with the latest on the investigation into the failed Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad. What's the latest?

HOLDER: Well, we've now developed evidence that shows that the Pakistani Taliban was behind the attack. We know that they helped facilitate it. We know that they probably helped finance it and that he was working at their direction.

TAPPER: Is there any evidence that there's a cell that Shahzad was working with in the United States? Or was it just him operating from directions from Pakistan?

HOLDER: All I can really say is that the investigation is ongoing and we are examining overseas connections that he might have, as well as any people he might have worked with here in the United States. But the investigation's ongoing in both those spheres.

TAPPER: In the last few days, U.S. officials have met with Pakistani officials, and the message, as conveyed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on ""60 Minutes"" is this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CLINTON: We want more. We expect more. We've made it very clear that if, heaven forbid, an attack like this that we can trace back to Pakistan were to have been successful, there would be very severe consequences.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TAPPER: What would those consequences be? And what more do you need the Pakistanis to be doing, the Pakistani government, beyond increased military action in North Waziristan, where the Pakistani Taliban is primarily located?

HOLDER: Well, in connection with the Shahzad investigation, they had been, I think, extremely aggressive, they've been cooperative with us, and I think we have been satisfied with the work that they have done. We want to make sure that kind of cooperation continues. To the extent that it does not, we will, as Secretary Clinton indicated, take the appropriate steps. But as of now, with regard to Shahzad, I think we're satisfied with the level of cooperation we've received.

TAPPER: Did the Pakistani government know about Shahzad before this happened? And did they tell the U.S. government at all anything about that?

HOLDER: We don't have any indication that the Pakistani government was aware of his plans or the attack that was planned by the Pakistani Taliban. We don't have any indication of that.

TAPPER: OK, Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud of the Pakistani -- Pakistani Taliban appeared in a video last month saying the time is very near when a Fedayeen, or soldiers, will attack the American states in the major cities. At the time that he issued that warning, U.S. policymakers didn't think the Pakistani Taliban had the ability to reach into the United States. They were, obviously, wrong?

HOLDER: Well, I'm not sure that we didn't think they had that ability. We didn't think that necessarily was their aim. We certainly have seen with the Shahzad incident that they have not only the aim, but the capability of doing that. And that's why they have taken on, I think, a new significance in our anti-terror fight.

TAPPER: Shahzad was on a Treasury Department watch list since the late 1990s for bringing large sums of cash into this country. He was taken off that watch list. Did the U.S. government drop the ball?

HOLDER: No, I don't think so. I think we have done a good job in monitoring those people who we need to identify as potential threats to the, you know, government, and I think one has to understand that in connection with the -- the resolution of this plot, American law enforcement I think was very successful.

TAPPER: More than 200,000 people from the U.S. traveled to Pakistan last year. How on Earth do you keep track of which ones intend to do us harm?

HOLDER: It is a difficult job. We have to try to use the various intelligence sources that we have, try to look for telltale signs for who we should be concerned about.

The vast majority of people who go to Pakistan and come from Pakistan to the United States are well intentioned. They have relatives. They have cultural ties to both countries. So we have to really try to focus and make sure that our attention is directed at those people who would do our nation harm.

TAPPER: There have been reports that others arrested this year in terrorist plots in the United States had traveled to Pakistan. Are there any ties with Shahzad?

HOLDER: Well, the investigation's ongoing. And we're looking at a variety of things to try to make sure that we hold everybody accountable who was responsible for this attempted attack. I think the investigation is proceeding at a good pace. We have developed, I think, a good amount of information in a relatively short period of time, but we will be continuing to work on it.

TAPPER: There was a time when the FBI and law enforcement lost track of Shahzad after the attempted incident, before he got on the plane. What happened?

HOLDER: Well, we lost contact with him for just a bit of time, but I think what people have to understand is that we had a layered approach so that at the end of the day I think we were always confident that he would be picked up, and the question was only where he would be picked up and when he would be picked up.

A surveillance was conducted, but we wanted to have him at a fairly good distance so that we could observe him and see if he would make contact with other people who were connected to the plot. Contact was lost for a relatively short period of time.

TAPPER: How long? An hour?

HOLDER: Oh, I don't know, about an hour, so maybe something along those lines. But what was key and what ultimately proved to be successful was this layered approach. He was caught before he was able to leave the country.

TAPPER: But he almost got out, right? I mean, we got lucky in a few ways. First of all, let's be honest: The reason that we avoided a horrible incident is because he was apparently an incompetent bomb- maker, right?

HOLDER: Well, there certainly was a bit of that, but I think also one has to look at the overall operation. He was stopped before he was able to leave the country because of a notification that the FBI made to put him on the no-fly list. We also had vigilant citizens who looked at that vehicle that he left and saw the smoke coming out and notified the appropriate authorities.

This was, in some ways, I think, a good example of what an aroused American populace, coupled with a vigilant law enforcement community, can actually do.

TAPPER: Critics say that he should not have been -- some critics say he should not have been his Miranda rights, the right to remain silent, et cetera. Now, I know that the public safety exception was invoked, so before he was read his rights, he was interrogated. But does the current Miranda system, which was created before I was born and was updated, this public safety exception, in 1984 -- so none of the crafters were really aware of this plot, this threat that we face today."	0

Ghawar's main producing structures are, from north to south: Ain Dar, Shedgum, Uthmaniyah, Hawiya, and Haradh. Ghawar alone accounts for about half of Saudi Arabia's total oil production capacity. Production Capacity

Saudi Arabia maintains the worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest crude oil production capacity, estimated to be around 10.5-11.0 million bbl/d. In 2005, Saudi ArabiaÃ¢ÂÂs Ministry of Petroleum announced the details of an $18-billion plan to increase capacity to 12 million bbl/d by 2009. Oil Daily reports, Aramco plans to drill 427 onshore and offshore crude oil development wells in 2007. Approximately 134 wells will be in or near Ghawar, while 85 will be drilled in Khurais, and some 50 drilled in Khursaniya. In December 2006, Saudi Aramco announced its 2007 exploration and drilling budget of almost $4 billion - nearly double the draft budget and full quarter of AramcoÃ¢ÂÂs 2007 capital budget. According toreports, Aramco plans to drill 427 onshore and offshore crude oil development wells in 2007. Approximately 134 wells will be in or near Ghawar, while 85 will be drilled in Khurais, and some 50 drilled in Khursaniya. Platts Oilgram ) in existing fields, meaning that the country needs around 700,000 bbl/d in additional capacity each year just to compensate for natural decline. One challenge for the Saudis in achieving their strategic vision to add production capacity is that their existing fields sustain, on average, 6 to 8 percent annual ""decline ratesÃ¢ÂÂ (as reported by) in existing fields, meaning that the country needs around 700,000 bbl/d in additional capacity each year just to compensate for natural decline. Aramco estimates that the average total depletion for Saudi oil fields is 29 percent, with Abqaiq (the oldest) 74 percent depleted, the giant Ghawar field having produced 48 percent of its proven reserves and the younger Shaybah just 5 percent depleted. Aramco also claims that, if anything, Saudi oil reserves are underestimated, not overestimated. Some analysts have disputed Aramco's optimistic assessments of Saudi oil reserves and future production. Minister Al-Naimi has vigorously refuted these arguments, and stated that Saudi Arabia could add as much as 200 billion barrels of oil to proven reserves after the extended period of investment and exploration. In order to stave off decline, wells are undergoing reservoir management and rehabilitation projects, including the installation of Ã¢ÂÂsmart wellÃ¢ÂÂ technologies. Production

Saudi Arabia produces a range of crude oils, from heavy to super light. Of Saudi Arabia's total oil production capacity, about 65-70 percent is considered light gravity, with the rest either medium or heavy; the country is moving to reduce the share of the latter two grades. Lighter grades generally are produced onshore, while medium and heavy grades come mainly from offshore fields. For 2006, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that Saudi Arabia produced around 10.7 million bbl/d of total oil -- comprising crude oil, natural gas liquids, and ""other liquids"" (includes half of the Saudi-Kuwaiti Divided Zone's 600,000 bbl/d). In addition to crude oil, Saudi Arabia produces around 1.5 million bbl/d of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and ""other liquids,"" not subject to OPEC quotas. o API Arabian Light crude. Abqaiq (17 billion barrels of proven reserves) produces approximately 400,000 bbl/d 37 o API Arab Extra Light crude. Since 1994, the Najd fields, which includes the Hawtah field and smaller satellites (Nuayyim, Hazmiyah) south of Riyadh, have been producing around 200,000 bbl/d of 45 o -50 o API, 0.06 percent sulphur, Arab Super Light. Offshore production includes Arab Medium crude from the Zuluf (over 500,000 bbl/d capacity) and Marjan (270,000 bbl/d capacity) fields and Arab Heavy crude from the Safaniya field. Most Saudi oil production, except for ""extra light"" and ""super light,"" is considered ""sour,"" containing relatively high levels of sulfur. The Ghawar field is the main producer of 5 million bbl/d of 34API Arabian Light crude. Abqaiq (17 billion barrels of proven reserves) produces approximately 400,000 bbl/d 37API Arab Extra Light crude. Since 1994, the Najd fields, which includes the Hawtah field and smaller satellites (Nuayyim, Hazmiyah) south of Riyadh, have been producing around 200,000 bbl/d of 45-50API, 0.06 percent sulphur, Arab Super Light. Offshore production includes Arab Medium crude from the Zuluf (over 500,000 bbl/d capacity) and Marjan (270,000 bbl/d capacity) fields and Arab Heavy crude from the Safaniya field. Most Saudi oil production, except for ""extra light"" and ""super light,"" is considered ""sour,"" containing relatively high levels of sulfur. The $4-billion project, known as the Qatif Producing Facilities Development Program (QPFDP), involved construction of two gas-oil separation plants (GOSPs), as well as gas treatment and oil stabilization facilities, for the Qatif and Abu Saafa oilfields (Abu Saafa is half owned by Bahrain). Additional production from these fields was slated to replace production elsewhere in Saudi Arabia, not to boost overall capacity. Despite recent OPEC cuts, Saudi Aramco continues aggressive plans to increase capacity; the following is a table of planed production capacity increases through 2011. In addition to these capacity increases, Saudi Aramco has said that it will also conduct additional drilling at existing fields in order to help compensate for the natural declines from the mature fields. o API sweet (nearly sulfur-free) Arab Extra Light crude oil, with production as of November 2006, at around 550,000 bbl/d from 141 wells. It is the largest oil field in the world that has been developed in the past two decades. According to Oil Minister Naimi (October 1999), the development of Shaybah showed that ""the cost of adding...capacity - that is, all the infrastructure, producing and transportation facilities - necessary to produce one additional barrel of oil per day in Saudi Arabia is, at most, $5,000 compared to between $10,000 and $20,000 in most areas of the world."" Saudi Arabia's long-term goal is to further develop its lighter crude reserves including the Shaybah field, located in the remote Empty Quarter (Rub al-Khali) area bordering the United Arab Emirates. (In June 2005, the UAE said it wanted to amend a 1974 border pact which gave the Saudis rights to Shaybah, which lies 80 percent in Saudi territory and 20 percent in UAE). Shaybah contains an estimated 14.3 billion barrels of premium grade 41.6API sweet (nearly sulfur-free) Arab Extra Light crude oil, with production as of November 2006, at around 550,000 bbl/d from 141 wells. It is the largest oil field in the world that has been developed in the past two decades. According to Oil Minister Naimi (October 1999), the development of Shaybah showed that ""the cost of adding...capacity - that is, all the infrastructure, producing and transportation facilities - necessary to produce one additional barrel of oil per day in Saudi Arabia is, at most, $5,000 compared to between $10,000 and $20,000 in most areas of the world."" ÃÂ· The Shaybah complex includes three gas/oil separation plants (GOSPs) and a 395-mile pipeline to connect the field to Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia's closest gathering center, for blending with Arab Light crude (Berri and Abqaiq streams). In addition to oil, Shaybah has a large natural gas ""cap"" (associated gas), with estimated reserves of 25 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). Gas production of 880 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) is re-injected. It is reported that possible gas recovery project could be implemented within 5 or 6 years, potentially for use in petrochemical production. ÃÂ· The Khurais fields (including Abu Jifan and Mazalij) west of Ghawar, will increase Saudi production capacity (of Arab Light) by 1.2 million bbl/d at a cost of $3 billion. Once online, Saudi Arabia will be the only oil producer to have two Ã¢ÂÂsuper giantÃ¢ÂÂ fields, that which produce more than 1 million bbl/d of crude oil. This is to involve installation of four GOSPs, with a capacity of 200,000 bbl/d each, at Khurais, which first came online in the 1963, but was mothballed by Aramco some three-decades later. Aramco plans to drill at least 300 exploration wells with 23 rigs. ÃÂ· Several other fields -- Abu Hadriya (1.8-2.0 billion barrels in reserves), Fadhili (1-1.4 billion barrels), Harmaliya, Khursaniya (3.5 billion barrels), and Manifa estimated 10 Ã¢ÂÂ 20 billion barrels) -- also mothballed by the Saudis during the 1980s and 1990s, will be brought back online given Saudi desire to maintain spare or Ã¢ÂÂswingÃ¢ÂÂ production capacity. In particular, Saudi Aramco is pushing ahead with development of the Abu Hadriya, Fadhili and Khursaniya (AFK) onshore fields. In March 2005, the Saudis awarded eight contracts for work at Khursaniya and also at Hawiya (see below). Production of 500,000 bbl/d (medium, 35 o API) of Arab Light from the AFK fields in on-track for late 2007. Besides AFK, the Saudis are planning to increase Arab Light production from the 1-billion-barrel Nuayyim onshore field by 100,000 bbl/d in 2009. ÃÂ· The $1.5 million Haradh-3 project increased production capacity at the Haradh oil field (which part of Ghawar) to 600,000 bbl/d by in April 2006. The expansion involves adding a third, 300,000-bbl/d GOSP to Haradh (in addition to two other 300,000-bbl/d GOSPs, one of which was inaugurated in January 2004). Haradh also is also producing significant volumes of non-associated natural gas, natural gas condensates and sulfur. The project was carried out by Aramco, along with private partners. ÃÂ· In their 2005 annual report, Saudi Aramco reported five smaller discoveries, three of which were predominantly oil. The new fields include Du'ayban, with 3,260 bbl/ day of Arabian Super Light, Halfa, with 6,000 bbl/d of Arabian Extra Light; and Muraiqib with 1,079 bb/d Arab Light. Also, Aramco reported a successful extension of reserves outside the booked reserves area at Fadhili, northeast of Riyadh. ""According to the report, the discovery could increase reserves by Ã¢ÂÂapproximately 700 million barrels of original oil in place, of whichÃ¢ÂÂ¦300 million barrels, is recoverable.Ã¢ÂÂ Saudi-Kuwaiti Neutral Zone; Bahrain

production of the Abu Saafa offshore field. The Saudi-Kuwait Divided Zone, 2230 sq mi between the borders of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that was left undefined in 1922, contains an estimated 5 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, divided equally between the two countries. Within the Divided Zone, Japan's Arabian Oil Co. (AOC) traditionally operated two offshore fields (Khafji and Hout) with 300,000 bbl/d in production (now approximately 150,000 bbl/d), but in February 2000, it lost the concession (in January 2003, AOC reached an agreement with Kuwait on the right to purchase at least 100,000 bbl/d of crude for the next 20 years from Khafji). Efforts to negotiate an extension of the operating contract with Saudi authorities failed when Japan refused to commit to investment in development projects desired by the Saudis. Saudi Aramco has taken over operation of the former AOC fields. ChevronTexaco, meanwhile, operates three onshore fields (Wafra, South Fawaris, and South Umm Gudair) in the Divided Zone under a 60-year license that expires in 2009. These fields have 2 billion barrels of proven reserves and total production of about 260,000 bbl/d. Finally, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia share the 300,000 bbl/dof the Abu Saafa offshore field. Refining

Oil and Gas Journal , Saudi Arabia has seven functioning refineries, with combined crude throughput capacity of around 2.1 million bbl/d, plus around 1.75 million bbl/d of refining capacity overseas, making it the sixth largest oil refiner in the world. The Saudi Aramco development plan calls for a $20-billion investment, increasing domestic refining capacity to 3 million bbl/d and international holdings by at least 1-2 million bbl/d by 2011, particularly in an effort to meet requirements of the fast-growing Asian market.

Saudi Aramco is also aiming to increase private investment through join ventures in downstream petroleum activities. In March 2006, FranceÃ¢ÂÂs Total and Saudi Aramco announced plans to build a $6-billion, 400,000-450,000 bbl/d export-oriented refinery in Jubail. Also in 2006, Aramco signed an MOU with Conoco Philips for a 400,000-bbl/d heavy conversion facility at Yanbu. As part of the privatization program, 30 percent of shares will reportedly be offered to the public. Reportedly, Aramco is considering putting out a tender for a privately-owned refinery at the port-city of Jizan ÃÂ· Last year Saudi Aramco and JapanÃ¢ÂÂs Sumitomo Chemical broke ground on the $9.8-billion Rabigh Refining and Petrochemical joint venture (PETRORabigh) - one of the biggest projects of its kind. Rabigh will be upgraded to 825,000 bbl/d (from 400,000 bbl/d), while shifting the product mix away from low-value heavy products towards gasoline and kerosene, while integrating the site with a new petrochemicals plan. The refinery will come online in 2008. At the same time, Aramco announced 100,000 bbl/d expansion and integration with neighboring petrochemical plants upgrades for Ras Tanura and Yanbu by 2010 to 2012. ÃÂ· Overseas, Saudi Arabia has interests in refineries in the US, South Korea, Japan and the Phillippeans . In July 2005, a new, $3.6 -billion 160,000 bbl/d refinery and petrochemical plant complex was inaugurated in Fujian, China. The facility is a joint venture between Sinopec (50 percent), ExxonMobil (25 percent), and Saudi Aramco (25 percent). Crude oil for the plant is to be supplied by Saudi Arabia under a long-term agreement, and will come online in 2007/2008. Aramco reports that capacity will be increased to 230,000 in the next few year. Aramco is also in talks with Sinopec to participate in the ongoing construction of a second facility in the northern province of Shandong (Qingdao). Both plants are expected to be able to handle high sulphur (""sour"") oils, as there is a dearth of such capacity worldwide. ÃÂ· In July 2004, Aramco signed an agreement with Shell to purchase a 15 percent share in Showa Shell Group, a refining and marketing company based in Japan. Under the deal, Aramco will supply Showa Shell with 300,000 bbl/d of crude oil. Saudi Arabia also owns a 7.9 percent share in AOC Holdings, which operates the 192,000 b/d Sodegaura refinery in Japan through a subsidiary, Fuji Oil. ÃÂ· In the Philippines, Aramco is conducting preliminary studies on a new $5-billion refinery at Mindanao, which will supply East Asia and the US West Coast. Aramco is also a 40 percent shareholder in Philippine Petron, which runs a 180,000 b/d refinery on the island. ÃÂ· In March 2005, Saudi Arabia and India signed an agreement on oil cooperation; with the Saudis reportedly interested in acquiring a stake in India Oil CompanyÃ¢ÂÂs expansion of the 180,000-bbl/d Paradip refinery (it will reach 300,000-bbl/d by 2008). Saudi Aramco is reportedly considering taking a stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited's (HPCL) Vishakhapatnam refinery (165,000 bbl/d capacity), which will be doubled in capacity by 2010-ll. ÃÂ· In the United States, Aramco and partner Royal Dutch/Shell are planning an expansion of at least one of their three Motiva joint-venture refineries in Louisiana and Texas. The three facilities have a total capacity of around 745,000, approximately 5 percent of the US refining market. There are detailed plans to expand the 290,000 b/d Port Arthur, Texas facility to 325,000 bbl/d by 2010. According to Aramco, however, future expansion plans will increase total capacity by 600,000 bbl/d. Saudi Aramco owns 50 percent of Motiva though their subsidiary, Saudi Refining. ÃÂ· Aramco also has reported interests in South Korea's Sangyong Oil Refining Company and Motor Oil (Hellas) in Greece. Security Issues

The Saudi petroleum pipeline and export network (and energy sector in general) remains a terrorism target. In February 2006, Saudi security prevented an attempted suicide bomb attack at the Abqaiq petroleum processing facility, after Al-Qaeda leadership called for renewed attacks against the countryÃ¢ÂÂs economic backbone. Nevertheless, energy infrastructure remains well-protected. Following the February incident, the government increased the National Guard and military security force to approximately 20,000, in addition to the 5000 guards employed directly by Aramco. Reportedly, security spending has been ramped up since a series of attacks against energy infrastructure and foreign nationals were carried out in 2004. In addition to direct security, Saudi Arabia is known to ensure export security by maintaining ""redundancy"" (i.e., multiple options for transportation and export) in its oil system, in part as a form of indirect security against any one facility being disabled."	0
368	"While the ostensible reasons for inflicting pain keep changing, however, the policy prescriptions of the Pain Caucus all have one thing in common: They protect the interests of creditors, no matter the cost. Deficit spending could put the unemployed to work Ã¢ÂÂ but it might hurt the interests of existing bondholders. More aggressive action by the Fed could help boost us out of this slump Ã¢ÂÂ in fact, even Republican economists have argued that a bit of inflation might be exactly what the doctor ordered Ã¢ÂÂ but deflation, not inflation, serves the interests of creditors. And, of course, thereÃ¢ÂÂs fierce opposition to anything smacking of debt relief.

Who are these creditors IÃ¢ÂÂm talking about? Not hard-working, thrifty small business owners and workers, although it serves the interests of the big players to pretend that itÃ¢ÂÂs all about protecting little guys who play by the rules. The reality is that both small businesses and workers are hurt far more by the weak economy than they would be by, say, modest inflation that helps promote recovery.

No, the only real beneficiaries of Pain Caucus policies (aside from the Chinese government) are the rentiers: bankers and wealthy individuals with lots of bonds in their portfolios.

And that explains why creditor interests bulk so large in policy; not only is this the class that makes big campaign contributions, itÃ¢ÂÂs the class that has personal access to policy makers Ã¢ÂÂ many of whom go to work for these people when they exit government through the revolving door. The process of influence doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have to involve raw corruption (although that happens, too). All it requires is the tendency to assume that whatÃ¢ÂÂs good for the people you hang out with, the people who seem so impressive in meetings Ã¢ÂÂ hey, theyÃ¢ÂÂre rich, theyÃ¢ÂÂre smart, and they have great tailors Ã¢ÂÂ must be good for the economy as a whole.

But the reality is just the opposite: creditor-friendly policies are crippling the economy. This is a negative-sum game, in which the attempt to protect the rentiers from any losses is inflicting much larger losses on everyone else. And the only way to get a real recovery is to stop playing that game."	0
369	"Mitt Romney came to coal country on Aug. 14, standing before a crowd of miners in eastern Ohio and pledging to fight for their jobs.



You could be forgiven if you thought this was much ado about 3,150 jobs -- the number employed directly by coal operations in Ohio, at least before two mines announced layoffs recently. But RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs greater point was about how coal fires so many power plants in Ohio and the region, and how, he says, environmental regulation from President Barack ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs administration threatens jobs at those plants, too. This could drive up the cost of electricity for every Ohioan, Romney said.



This debate -- over the cost of electricity, the shift among power plants to natural gas, the environmental and health risks, the role the government should or shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt play -- has been building for years. And after the event, the Obama campaign had a response, saying that RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs position on coal has changed substantially since he was governor of Massachusetts.



""Immediately after becoming governor, Romney condemned coal-fired plants, saying they kill people,"" said an Obama campaign news release.

The claim was similar to one the Obama team made in a radio ad, and Obama reelection aides backed it with specific quotes Romney made in February, 2003, when Romney was the freshly elected governor of Massachusetts.

The quotes:

""That plant kills people."" This was in reference to the Salem Harbor power plant, in the Boston area.

""I will not create jobs that kill people."" This, too, was made by Romney outside the Salem Harbor plant.

The Obama campaign also highlighted a Romney quote that had no lethal references but was just as strong. It came from a state of Massachusetts news releasein which Romney said: ""If the choice is between dirty power plants or protecting the health of the people of Massachusetts, there is no choice in my mind. I will always come down on the side of public health.""



Romney made each of these statements during a Feb. 6, 2003, showdown over the future of the controversial, coal-burning Salem Harbor Power Station.



In 2001, Massachusetts passed new rules to reduce power plant emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and mercury, to be phased in over several years. The mercury standard would not be finalized until 2004. Romney supported the rules, as he made clear repeatedly.



Massachusetts singled out its most egregious polluters as the ""Filthy Five"" plants, including Salem Harbor. Public health and environmental scientists at Harvard studied the emissions from two of the plants in 2000 and concluded that Salem Harbor was responsible for 53 deaths, 570 emergency room visits, 14,400 asthma attacks and 99,000 incidents of upper respiratory symptoms -- all per year.



As occurs with similar studies that health authorities cite, local residents and others who wanted to keep the Salem Harbor plant open (for jobs and tax revenue) disputed those figures, saying they resulted from unproven modeling. It turned out that the Harvard scientists had revised their figures in 2002, putting premature deaths from Salem HarborÃ¢ÂÂs pollution at 30 per year and reducing the number of emergency room visits to 400 and the asthma attacks at 2,000, according to the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald.



But the scientists stood by the broader conclusion -- that emissions from dirty power plants can be deadly. The Harvard methodology has now been widely replicated and is respected by health scientists, according to several environmental authorities we spoke with. Romney appeared to accept their findings, too. In the above-mentioned news release, the commonwealth of Massachusetts quoted Romney in the third person on the danger factor:



""Romney said that the Salem Harbor plant is responsible for 53 premature deaths, 570 emergency room visits and 14,400 asthma attacks each year. He also pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming.""



This was in a news release issued by the governorÃ¢ÂÂs aides, not some radical outside instigator. It was issued under the name of Romney, Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey and RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs development chief, Douglas Foy. According to the Boston Globe, Romney hired Foy from the Conservation Law Foundation, or CLF, a leading environmental advocacy group in Massachusetts.



The spat with Salem Harbor turned into a testy exchange that February day after Salem HarborÃ¢ÂÂs then-owner, Pacific Gas and Electric, sought an extension until 2006 to comply with MassachusettsÃ¢ÂÂ emissions rules -- and plant supporters showed up to to demand that the governor back off. Romney was adamant that the company comply by 2004. His statements that day show how he felt: ""That plant kills people."" And to those including city officials who argued that this would cost jobs: ""I will not create jobs that kill people.""



Based on some of the quotes, it might appear that Romney was speaking only about that single plant (which a new owner, Dominion, is phasing out, after which a subsequent third owner will build a natural gas plant there). ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we thought when we began looking into this. It is also what the Romney campaign told us in email.



So was it accurate for the Obama campaign to imply that RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs words characterized his broader attitude toward coal emissions when he was governor?



We kept looking, because people in the environmental community told us it was a valid claim. And the news release under RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs name suggested it as well.



Romney spoke of plants, not just a single one, when he pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming.



Still, to give him the benefit of doubt, what if he really just meant the Salem Harbor plant? WasnÃ¢ÂÂt that plant particularly egregious when compared with coal-fired plants under attack by federal regulators today?



No, say environmentalists who include authorities from the CLF.



Their claims are supported by U.S. EPA emissions data we verified independently.



""When he said that Ã¢ÂÂthis plant kills people,Ã¢ÂÂ he was talking about a plant that produced pollution comparable to the emissions of plants in the Midwest,"" said Seth Kaplan, vice president for policy and climate advocacy at the conservation foundation.



Jonathan Peress, an environmental and regulatory attorney who works for the CLF and was recently chairman of the American Bar AssociationÃ¢ÂÂs air quality committee, added in a separate interview with PolitiFact Ohio that Romney promoted Massachusetts air standards that were almost identical to those the U.S. EPA wants to enforce -- and that Romney now criticizes.



""The levels of emissions that he was talking about were levels that were virtually identical to what the EPA has proposed,"" Kaplan agreed. ""He was steadfastly standing behind emissions reductions that are the same as those currently attacked.""



To see if this was accurate -- that the emissions Romney decried were similar to or even weaker than those under current attack now by the EPA (whose rules Romney now attacks) -- we examined the emissions cuts that Massachusetts wanted and data on the level of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions at Salem Harbor and in the Midwest. The U.S. EPA keeps the information in its extensive Clean Air Markets database.



Nitrogen oxides react with sunlight to create ozone and smog. Sulfur dioxide is tied to particulate matter and is considered particularly dangerous to health, said Jonathan Walke, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund.



The level of both these substances was multiple times lower at Salem Harbor, even when Romney was trying to force the plant to reduce emissions, than at Eastlake in Northeast Ohio and several other Ohio plants we checked. Our comparisons included multiple years, including Salem Harbor in 2003 with Ohio plants in 2011. To compensate for differences in electricity output, number of boilers and hours of operation at different power plants, we checked the data for emissions per megawatt-hour. The pattern held.



""ItÃ¢ÂÂs all the same pollution, albeit in higher quantities in Ohio,"" Walke said.



You might ask why we looked at Eastlake. ItÃ¢ÂÂs because FirstEnergy Corp. plans to shut down two of that plantÃ¢ÂÂs boilers rather than spend heavily on scrubbers to comply with EPA rules. This is one of several coal-burning plants at the heart of the current jobs-versus-pollution debate, although Romney did not mention it specifically.



ItÃ¢ÂÂs important to note that the rules on nitrogen and sulfur are not what is prompting the FirstEnergy shutdowns. New EPA rules on mercury and toxic metals are the cause of planned closures in Eastlake. The tougher limits wonÃ¢ÂÂt take effect until 2014. The EPA aims to cut mercury emissions by 79 percent.



But as the Massachusetts governor, Romney supported mercury reductions in his state, too. In 2004, he signed off on a rule aiming to reduce mercury emissions by 95 percent by 2012. With RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs name on the letterhead, Massachusetts in May, 2004, issued a lengthy set of justifications for the mercury rule. Among them:



""First, [new research] confirms and extends our understanding of mercury's harmful effects on learning, attention and other critical cognitive skills in children. Recent studies have found that children exposed to mercury levels may show signs of attention deficit disorder, impaired visual-spatial skills and poor coordination.""



Romney was ""a champion"" of those mercury regulations, said Shanna Cleveland, a staff attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation. ""He was one of the reasons we got them through.""



Time to clean up: Romney was discussing a specific power plant, Salem Harbor, when he said, ""That plant kills people."" But the public record shows that his comments were part of a broad emissions-cutting program he embraced.



And the power plant that he considered deadly had emissions that were no worse, and in many cases lower, than at Midwest plants that he would now wants left alone, citing the use of affordable and abundant coal.



If one were to have supported the regulations Romney wanted in 2003, itÃ¢ÂÂs fairly safe to assume that ""one would also support such things nationally,"" said Jonathan Levy, an environmental scientist at Boston University and Harvard and co-author of the now heavily replicated study on the correlation between coal-burning power plants and respiratory health.



The Obama campaign claimed that as governor, Romney condemned coal plants as killers. He spoke at times of a single plant, but at other times made clear that other plants also needed to cut emissions for the sake of public health. This even included new rules for mercury reductions -- the same substance from coal plants that now is prompting closures in Ohio.



The debate over coal involves calculations of costs, the abundance or scarcity of natural resources, health and environmental risks, and attitudes about government regulation. It is not our role to say Romney was right or wrong at one time.



But with additional information from emissions data, interviews and the public record of his governorship, the Obama campaign claim about RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs coal position of nine years ago is nearly as clear as a haze-free day.

371	"Of all the major Republicans, the one who comes closest to my worldview is Newt Gingrich. Despite his erratically shifting views and odd phases, he continually returns to this core political refrain: He talks about using government in energetic but limited ways to increase growth, dynamism and social mobility.

As he said in 2007, Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not a point of view libertarians would embrace, but I am more in the Alexander Hamilton-Teddy Roosevelt tradition of conservatism. I recognize that there are times when you need government to help spur private enterprise and economic development.Ã¢ÂÂ

Look at American history, Gingrich continued, Ã¢ÂÂThe government provided railroad land grants to encourage widespread adoption of what was then the most modern form of transportation to develop our country. The Homestead Act essentially gave away land to those willing to live on it and develop it. We used what were in effect public-private partnerships to bring telephone service and electricity to every community in our nation. All of these are examples of government bringing about public purposes without creating massive taxpayer-funded bureaucracies.Ã¢ÂÂ

This was not one of GingrichÃ¢ÂÂs passing fads. It is one of the most consistent themes of his career. His 1984 book, Ã¢ÂÂWindow of Opportunity,Ã¢ÂÂ is a broadside against what he calls the Ã¢ÂÂlaissez-faireÃ¢ÂÂ conservatism Ã¢ÂÂ the idea that government should just get out of the way so the market can flourish. As he wrote, Ã¢ÂÂThe opportunity society calls not for a laissez-faire society in which the economic world is a neutral jungle of purely random individual behavior, but for forceful government intervention on behalf of growth and opportunity.Ã¢ÂÂ"	0
372	"A new TV ad from the McCain campaign portrays the Arizona senator as a leader in the fight against global warming.

The ad begins with fast-paced music and horns honking. It shows black-and-white scenes of crowded freeways, smokestacks belching and a glacier collapsing.

""John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago,"" the narrator says.

The stark black-and-white scenes are replaced by more pleasant color footage of a wind turbine against a bright blue sky and water flowing through a dam.

""Today, he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions. A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment.""

With images such as a newspaper headline that says ""McCain climate views clash with GOP,"" the ad portrays McCain as an independent voice on climate change.

Indeed, the Congressional Record shows that McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that.

On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights.

When he introduced the bill, McCain called it ""the first comprehensive piece of legislation"" in capping emissions.

""The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. ""It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem.""

By contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change.

Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in ""educating the Senate"" about how government could respond to global warming.

""It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House,"" Roy said.

He called McCain ""a huge leader on this issue in the Senate.""

And so we find McCain's statement to be True."	0

A California Democrat was recently given a platform by USA Today to publish a shocking editorial that calls for nationwide confiscation of all Ã¢ÂÂmilitary-style semiautomatic assault weaponsÃ¢ÂÂ from law-abiding citizens.

Representative Eric Swalwell from CaliforniaÃ¢ÂÂs 15th District wrote that all so-called Ã¢ÂÂassaultÃ¢ÂÂ weapons need to be banned, and that a federal gun buy-back program needs to be instituted in order to effectively collect them all from the citizenry.

Rep. Swalwell even goes a step further, insisting that those who refuse to hand over their Ã¢ÂÂassaultÃ¢ÂÂ weapons be criminally prosecuted Ã¢ÂÂ including law-abiding gun owners who have never been convicted of committing a crime with their legally-purchased weaponry.

Not content to simply impose a fresh ban on all new Ã¢ÂÂassaultÃ¢ÂÂ weapon purchases, which in and of itself is unconstitutional, Rep. Swalwell actually wants to see door-to-door gun confiscation teams engage in Nazi-style removal tactics in order to rid the streets of all firearms that he personally deems reckless and unnecessary.

Ã¢ÂÂReinstating the federal assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 would prohibit manufacture and sales, but it would not affect weapons already possessed,Ã¢ÂÂ Rep. Swalwell wrote in his op-ed for USA Today. Ã¢ÂÂThis would leave millions of assault weapons in our communities for decades to come.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂInstead, we should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons.Ã¢ÂÂ

Democrats like Rep. Swalwell are enemies of the Constitution, and enemies of We the People

He set up a website, posted gushing stories about Hillary Clinton and waited for ad sales to soar.

Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt know why, but it did not work,Ã¢ÂÂ said the student, Beqa Latsabidze, 22, who was savvy enough to change course when he realized what did drive traffic: laudatory stories about Donald J. Trump that mixed real Ã¢ÂÂ and completely fake Ã¢ÂÂ news in a stew of anti-Clinton fervor.

More than 6,000 miles away in Vancouver, a Canadian who runs a satirical website, John Egan, had made a similar observation. Mr. EganÃ¢ÂÂs site, The Burrard Street Journal, offers sendups of the news, not fake news, and he is not trying to fool anyone. But he, too, discovered that writing about Mr. Trump was a Ã¢ÂÂgold mine.Ã¢ÂÂ His traffic soared and his work, notably a story that President Obama would move to Canada if Mr. Trump won, was plundered by Mr. Latsabidze and other internet entrepreneurs for their own websites.

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs all Trump,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Egan said by telephone. Ã¢ÂÂPeople go nuts for it.Ã¢ÂÂ

With Mr. Obama now warning of the corrosive threat from fake political news circulated on Facebook and other social media, the pressing question is who produces these stories, and how does this overheated, often fabricated news ecosystem work?"	1
375	"During a time when the Republican PartyÃ¢ÂÂs presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, should be working to bring the party together and prepare for the primary battle against Hillary Clinton, he continues to deepen the divide between Republicans and Americans alike.

TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs recent attack on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel because of his Mexican-American background prompted Sen. Lindsey Graham to round up the Republicans who have previously endorsed Donald Trump, and persuade them to take it all back.

Graham claimed that TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs racist remarks were Ã¢ÂÂthe most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂIf anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,Ã¢ÂÂ Graham told The New York Times.Ã¢ÂÂ

Senator Graham elaborated on this during an interview with NBC NewsÃ¢ÂÂ Hallie Jackson.

Ã¢ÂÂThere are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂBut thereÃ¢ÂÂll come a point in time where weÃ¢ÂÂre gonna have to understand that itÃ¢ÂÂs not just about the 2016 race, itÃ¢ÂÂs about the future of the party and I would like to support our nominee. I just canÃ¢ÂÂt.Ã¢ÂÂ

Donald Trump claimed that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump University case, has been biased toward him because of his Latino heritage.

Ã¢ÂÂI couldnÃ¢ÂÂt disagree more with a statement like that,Ã¢ÂÂ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Sunday.

Ã¢ÂÂThose kinds of comments are very serious to me,Ã¢ÂÂ Rep. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said to News radio WGAN. Ã¢ÂÂThey are completely unacceptable, and what they indicate Ã¢ÂÂ which is why I think this is so serious Ã¢ÂÂ is a lack of respect for our judicial system and for the separation of powers doctrine that is enshrined in the Constitution.Ã¢ÂÂ

Although many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have condemned TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs accusations, they continue to support him."	1

377	"Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: The Past Versus the Future

Denver, CO | January 30, 2008



Thank you Caroline - for your introduction, your support, and your lifetime of service to a grateful nation. You continue to inspire Americans of all ages and walks of life.

Let me also say a few words about another American who has called us to a common purpose. John Edwards has spent a lifetime fighting to give voice to the voiceless and hope to the struggling. At a time when our politics is too focused on who's up and who's down, he made us focus on who matters - the New Orleans child without a home, the West Virginia miner without a job, the families who live in that other America that is not seen or heard or talked about in Washington. John and Elizabeth Edwards believe deeply that two Americans can become one. Their campaign may have ended, but this cause lives on for all of us who believe that we can achieve one America.

Seven months from now, the Democratic Party will gather here in Denver to nominate our candidate for President of the United States.

We will come together after a long and hard fought primary campaign - and that's a good thing. Because it is through campaigns that we hear directly from the American people, set our common goals, and debate our differences. It is through campaigns that we bring new people into the process; build new coalitions; and renew who we are and what we stand for as a Party.

It is fitting that the journey leads to Denver - a city that is younger than the Democratic Party itself, but filled with the promise that our Party has always fought for. This city, built at the base of the Rocky Mountains, stands as a monument to a uniquely American belief in things unseen. Here, in Denver, fur trappers and traders; gold rushers and ranchers; came in search of opportunity, and made the future their own.

The story of America leads west. It is a story of ideals that know no boundaries. It is a story of immigrants who set out from distant shores; pioneers who persevered; and people of all races, religions, and ethnic groups who put aside their doubts to seek a new frontier.

My own family's journey moved west - from Kansas, where my grandparents met and married, and my mother was born; to the Pacific Coast after World War II; and then across an ocean to Hawaii. Their journey - like so many others - speaks to a simple truth written into the story of America. It's a truth at the foundation of the Democratic Party's purpose, Denver's progress, and our nation's promise: in America, the future is what we decide it's going to be.

As candidates, we must give new meaning to that promise. And seven months from now, one of us will stand before that convention hall, and give voice to the hopes, and dreams, and determination of Americans all across our country. In six days, you get to choose who will be that voice. You get to choose who will be able to build a new majority of not just Democrats - but Independents and Republicans - to win in November, and transform our country. And if you put your trust in me, I will stand up at that convention and say that our divisions are past, our hope is the future, and our time for change has come.

Now there is one thing we know for certain about the election in November: the name George Bush will not be on the ballot. The name of my cousin - Dick Cheney - will not be on the ballot. But the choice before you is about what comes next. Because we need to do more than turn the page on the failed Bush-Cheney policies; we have to turn the page on the politics that helped make those policies possible.

Lobbyists setting an agenda in Washington that feeds the inequality, insecurity, and instability in our economy.

Division and distraction that keeps us from coming together to deal with challenges like health care, and clean energy, and crumbling schools year after year after year.

Cronyism that gave us Katrina instead of competent government. And secrecy that made torture permissible and illegal wiretaps possible.

It's a politics that uses 9/11 to scare up votes; and fear and falsehoods to lead us into a war in Iraq that should've never been authorized and should've never been waged.

Each candidate running for the Democratic nomination shares an abiding desire to end the disastrous policies of the current administration. But we must decide - in the debate that leads to Denver - just what kind of Party we want to be, and what lessons we've learned from the bitter partisanship of the last two decades. We can be a Party that tries to beat the other side by practicing the same do-anything, say-anything, divisive politics that has stood in the way of progress; or we can be a Party that puts an end to it.

I am running for President because I believe that we need fundamental change in America. Not just a change of Party in the White House, but change in Washington that the American people can believe in - unity instead of division; hope instead of fear; a politics that leaves behind the fights of the past so that we can finally take hold of our future.

We began this campaign one year ago on the steps of the old statehouse in Springfield. At the time, we made a bet on the American people. That bet was simple - we weren't going to change anything by relying on the same Washington games; instead, we were betting on the American people's hunger for change, and your ability to make change happen from the bottom-up.

And we are showing America what change looks like. From the snows of Iowa to the sunshine of South Carolina, we have built a movement of young and old; rich and poor; black and white; Latino, Asian and Native American. We've reached Americans of all political stripes who are more interested in turning the page than turning up the heat on our opponents. That's how Democrats will win in November and build a majority in Congress. Not by nominating a candidate who will unite the other party against us, but by choosing one who can unite this country around a movement for change.

If you choose change, you will have a nominee who doesn't take a dime from Washington lobbyists and PACs. We don't need a candidate who agrees with Republicans that lobbyists are part of the system in Washington. They're part of the problem. And when I'm President, their days of setting the agenda in Washington will be over.

If you choose change, you will have a nominee who doesn't just tell people what they want to hear. Poll-tested positions and calculated answers might be how Washington confronts challenges, but it's not how you overcome them; it's not how you inspire our nation to come together behind a common purpose; and it's not what America needs right now.

If you choose change, you will have a nominee who isn't just playing on the same electoral map where half the country starts out against us, because you will have a nominee who has already brought in more Independents and Republicans; young people and new voters; than we have seen in a generation.

I know it is tempting - after another presidency by a man named George Bush - to simply turn back the clock, and to build a bridge back to the 20th Century. There are those will tell us that our Party should nominate someone who is more practiced in the art of pursuing power; that's it's not yet our turn or our time. There was also a time when Caroline Kennedy's father was counseled by a former President to Ã¢ÂÂbe patient,Ã¢ÂÂ and to step aside for Ã¢ÂÂsomeone with greater experience.Ã¢ÂÂ But John F. Kennedy responded by saying, Ã¢ÂÂThe world is changing. The old ways will not doÃ¢ÂÂ¦It is time for a new generation of leadership.Ã¢ÂÂ

It is time for a new generation of leadership, because the old politics just won't do. I am running for President - right now - because I have met Americans all across this country who cannot afford to wait another day for change. That is why the real choice in this campaign is not between regions or religions or genders. It's not about rich versus poor; young versus old; and it is not about black versus white.

It is about the past versus the future. And when I am the nominee, the Republicans won't be able to make this election about the past because you will have already chosen the future.

It's time for new leadership for an economy where families are being forced to foreclose on their dreams, and workers have seen their pensions disappear.

In the short-term, we need what I have consistently called for - a stimulus plan that gives the American people a tax rebate, and that also extends relief to seniors and expands unemployment insurance. And in the long-term, we need to put the American Dream on a firmer foundation. We're not going to offer the American people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who voted to put the banks and big business ahead of hard-working Americans. I've been fighting for working people my entire public life. And when I am President, I'll make sure that CEOs can't dump your pension with one hand while they collect a bonus with the other. I'll pass bankruptcy laws that protect workers instead of banks. And I'll crack down on fraudulent mortgage lenders, and credit card companies that change your rates to push you further into debt.

It's time for new leadership for the Maytag worker who is now competing with his own teenage son for a $7 an-hour job at Walmart because the factory he gave his life to shut its doors.

We're not going to offer the American people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who argues year after year for trade that isn't fair, but calls for a time-out on trade when they run for President. I will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working Americans. I will stop giving the wealthiest Americans tax cuts that they don't need and didn't ask for, and restore fairness to our economy. I'll give a tax cut to working people; provide relief to homeowners; and eliminate the income tax for seniors making under $50,000 so they can retire with the dignity and security they have earned.

It's time for new leadership for the woman I met who can't get Medicaid to cover the needs of her sick child.

She can't afford to wait another four years or another fifteen years to get health care because we've put forward a nominee who can't bring Democrats and Republicans together to get things done. I know that the reason Americans don't have health care isn't because no one is forcing them to buy it - it's because they can't afford it. That's why my plan cuts costs by up to $2500 for a typical family, and makes health care available and affordable for every single American. That's the plan that I'll pass in my first term as President.

It is time for new leadership for children going to overcrowded schools in East L.A.; for the teacher I met who is working at Dunkin Donuts to make ends meet; for the young people who are ready to go to college but can't afford it.

When I'm President, we'll rally this country to the cause of world-class education. That means putting our kids on a pathway to success with universal, quality, affordable early childhood education. That means paying our teachers more, and making sure they're not just teaching to the test - but teaching art and music and literature. That means giving our young people an annual $4,000 tax credit for college tuition if they serve their community; and that means expanding AmeriCorps to 250,000 slots, and issuing a call to service for a new generation. But that also means calling on parents to do their part - to get off the couch, turn off the television, and read to our children. Because responsibility for education starts at home.

It's time for new leadership so that my daughters and your children don't grow up in a century where our economy is weighed down by our addiction to oil; our foreign policy is held hostage to the whims of dictators; and our planet passes a moment of no return.

When I'm President, we won't wait any longer to reduce emissions. When I called for higher fuel efficiency standards, I didn't do it in front of an environmental group in California or in Boulder - that would have been the easy thing to do. I did it in front of the automakers in Detroit. Now it was pretty quiet - I didn't get a lot of applause. But we need leadership that tells the American people not just what they want to hear, but what we need to know. That's what I'll do. We cannot wait to invest in the next generation of biofuels, and wind and solar. If President Kennedy could send us to the moon in less than a decade - then we can meet this great challenge our generation. We can set the goal of an 80% reduction in global emissions by 2050, and we can lead the world to confront the climate crisis.

And it's time for new leadership for the woman who told me that she hasn't been able to breathe since the day her nephew left for Iraq, and the soldier who doesn't know his own child because he's on his third or fourth tour of duty.

I will end the mentality that says the only way for Democrats to look tough on national security is by talking, acting and voting like George Bush Republicans. It's time to reject the counsel that says the American people would rather have someone who is strong and wrong than someone who is weak and right - it's time to say that we are the Party that is going to be strong and right.

It's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone who agreed with him on voting for the war in Iraq; who agreed with him by voting to give George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran; who agrees with him in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like; and who actually differed with him by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions when the politics of the moment changed.

We need to offer the American people a clear contrast on national security, and when I am the nominee of the Democratic Party, that's exactly what I will do. Talking tough and tallying up your years in Washington is no substitute for judgment, and courage, and clear plans. It's not enough to say you'll be ready from Day One - you have to be right from Day One.

I opposed this war in Iraq from the start, and I have never, ever wavered in that opposition. I warned about taking our eye off of Osama bin Laden, and overstretching our troops and their families as we have seen in communities across this country like Fort Carson. And when I am President, I will immediately begin to remove our troops, I will finally put meaningful pressure on Iraq's leaders to reconcile, and I will end this war. And I will do what we should have done back in 2002: increase our commitment to Afghanistan, press Pakistan to take action against terror, and finish the fight with al Qaeda.

I will challenge the conventional thinking that says we can't conduct diplomacy with leaders we don't like. Strong countries and strong Presidents talk to their adversaries as well as their friends, and that's what I'll do. And when I am President, we will keep nuclear weapons from terrorists by securing all loose nuclear materials around the world during my first term in office. We will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons, and we will pursue it.

It's time for new leadership that reaches out, as President Kennedy did to my own father, to people Ã¢ÂÂin the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery.Ã¢ÂÂ

It's time to restore our moral leadership by rejecting torture without equivocation; by closing Guantanamo; by restoring habeas corpus; and by again being that light of justice to dissidents in prison camps around the globe. It's time for America to lead the world against the common threats of the 21st century - terrorism and nuclear weapons, but also climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. I will send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, Ã¢ÂÂYou matter to us. Your future is our future. And our moment is now.Ã¢ÂÂ

This is what the moment demands of us - to cast off our doubts; to reach once more for what America can be if we have the courage to make the future our own.

We've been warned, in these last few weeks, that this kind of change isn't possible. That we're peddling false hopes. That we need a reality check.

And we've faced forces that are not the fault of any one campaign - forces that open American wounds. The politics that uses religion as a wedge, and patriotism as a bludgeon. A politics that tells us what we have to think and even vote within the confines of the categories that supposedly define us. The assumption that young people are apathetic. The assumption that Republicans won't cross over. The assumption that the wealthy care nothing for the poor, and that the poor don't vote. The assumption that African-Americans can't support the white candidate; whites can't support the African-American candidate; and blacks and Latinos can't come together.

But our Party - the Democratic Party - has always been at its best when we rose above these divisions; when we called all Americans to a common purpose, a higher purpose; when we stood up and said that we will write our own future, and the future will be what we want it to be.

We followed a King to the mountaintop, and a Kennedy who called on us to reject the mindless menace of violence.

We're the party of a young President who asked what we could do for our country, and who put us on a path to the moon.

We're the party of a man who overcame his own disability; who told us that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself; and who faced down fascism and liberated a continent from tyranny.

We're the party of Jackson, who took back the White House for the people of this country.

And we're the party of Jefferson, who wrote the words that we are still trying to heed - that all of us are created equal - and who sent us West to blaze new trails, to make new discoveries, and to realize the promise of our highest ideals.

That is who we are. That is the Party that we need to be, and can be, if we cast off our doubts, and leave behind our fears, and choose the America that we know is possible. Because there is a moment in the life of every generation, if it is to make its mark on history, when its spirit has to come through, when it must choose the future over the past, when it must make its own change from the bottom up.

This is our moment. This is our message - the same message we had when we were up, and when we were down. The same message that we will carry all the way to the convention. And in seven months time - right here in Denver - we can realize this promise; we can claim this legacy; we can choose new leadership for America. Because there is nothing we cannot do if the American people decide it is time."	0
378	"Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore is denying that he romantically pursued teenagers as young as 14 while he was in his 30s after a bombshell report.

The women accusing Moore told the Washington Post that when they were between the ages of 14 and 18, he romantically pursued them.

One woman, Leigh Corfman, told the Post that when she was 14 years old in 1979, a 32-year-old Moore Ã¢ÂÂtook off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes.Ã¢ÂÂ

Corfman told the Post that Moore Ã¢ÂÂtouched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear.Ã¢ÂÂ

The outspoken social conservative said in a statement the four women quoted by the Washington Post are lying.

Ã¢ÂÂThis garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation,Ã¢ÂÂ Moore said.

Former White House adviser Stephen Bannon helped Moore trounce establishment favorite Luther Strange in a September Republican primary, over President TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs warning that Moore was less electable.

Moore currently is in a close race against Democrat Doug Jones ahead of a Dec. 12 election. Ã¢ÂÂ Washington Examiner

Stephanie McCrummen, the reporters who co-wrote the Washington Post hit piece on Judge Roy Moore, apparently has a history of Ã¢ÂÂfakingÃ¢ÂÂ things like fake checks for instanceÃ¢ÂÂ¦

According to the anti-Trump publication, Red State, McCrummen, who works for the Washington Post, (who many consider to be Ã¢ÂÂfake news, after using mulitple Ã¢ÂÂunnamed sourcesÃ¢ÂÂ in an attempt to tie President Trump to the Russians), has a criminal record that involves writing a FAKE check.

Ms. McCrummen has a rather interesting criminal history herself, as public criminal records in multiple states stretching across 4 time zones have shown.

Ms. McCrummenÃ¢ÂÂs criminal history began with North Carolina Case # 1992 CR 00654, a violation of the Article 19 Ã¢ÂÂ False Pretenses and Cheats section of the North Carolina Criminal Code. Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless.

Ms. McCrummenÃ¢ÂÂs other offenses are all traffic related and in 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped ArizonaÃ¢ÂÂs jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction. McCrummen has now found herself a four-time loser in the statesÃ¢ÂÂ criminal courts. She currently resides outside of the jurisdiction of the three states where she committed her crimes.

Sean Hannity ripped into the media frenzy over the Judge Moore scandal on his show last night. The left is calling for his head today:

https://twitter.com/MichelleRMed/status/928971595087073280

When a reporter has a criminal history that essentially proves she gave false information to pay a debt or for services, shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt her character come into question when it comes to making a 40 year old sexual allegation against one of the most hated, Steve Bannon backed conservatives running for office in America, that may help to enhance her career?"	1

CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: IÃ¢ÂÂm Chris Wallace.

Keeping America safe after the terror attack in England. What steps is the government taking this Memorial Day weekend?

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JOHN KELLY, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: It's a constant threat and we always have to be vigilant.

WALLACE: WeÃ¢ÂÂll discuss the investigation into the bombing and the response here in the U.S. with the secretary of homeland security, General John Kelly, live, only on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Then, new reports the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner discussed setting up a secret communications channel between the Trump transitions in the Kremlin. WeÃ¢ÂÂll ask our Sunday panel where this takes the expanding probe into Russian interference.

Plus, President Trump returns from his first trip overseas to a domestic agenda in trouble, from ObamaCare repeal and replace to the budget, some on Capitol Hill wonder whether Congress will pass anything.

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-SOUTH CAROLINA: Yes, definitely dead on arrival.

SEN. DICK DURBIN, D-ILLINOIS: This is step backwards. YouÃ¢ÂÂre not going to make America great again with this budget.

WALLACE: WeÃ¢ÂÂll break down the president's priorities and prospects with a number two Democrat in the Senate, Dick Durbin, and Republican senator, Dr. Bill Cassidy.

And our power player of the week flying high for the Blue Angels.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Boy, is it sweet when we put all that together and get that synergy and you feel that fuzz.

WALLACE: All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: And hello again on this Memorial Day weekend from Fox News in Washington.

President Trump is back at the White House arriving late last night after a largely successful nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe. But he returns to a spreading scandal about links between the Kremlin and some of his current and former advisors, and to a domestic agenda that stalled in Congress.

WeÃ¢ÂÂll get to all of that this hour, but we begin with terror, that suicide bombing at a concert in Manchester, England, that killed 22, just the first of four savage attacks this week around the world.

Joining us now, the man in charge of keeping America safe, the secretary of homeland security, General John Kelly.

Mr. Secretary, welcome to ""Fox News Sunday.""

Before we get to terror, let me ask you about the hot story in Washington now. These revelations about Jared Kushner trying to set up a back channel to the Kremlin, through the Soviet and -- the Russian ambassador. Your reaction to that? Is there anything improper with that?

KELLY: Well, I don't know if it's true or not. I know itÃ¢ÂÂs being -- it's being reported in the press.

WALLACE: It has been confirmed to me the conversation took place.

KELLY: OK. Then I would just tell you, Chris, that I think any channel of communications back or otherwise with a country like Russia is a good thing. I mean, multiple ways to communicate back and forth is a good thing with a country I think, and particularly a country thatÃ¢ÂÂs like Russia. So, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt -- it doesn't bother me.

I mean, you just have to assume, obviously, that what youÃ¢ÂÂre getting is -- may or may not be true, they may be working you. But that's the whole point. I mean, that communication goes into the White House as a data point in terms of discussion. So, I don't see the big deal.

WALLACE: Let me -- you say you don't see a big deal?

KELLY: No, I think any time you have channels of communication with a country, particularly one like Russia, I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt criticize it.

WALLACE: But you talked about a data point into the White House. This is during the transition.

KELLY: Right.

WALLACE: These were private officials.

KELLY: Right.

WALLACE: We have one president at a time. Does that make a difference?

KELLY: You know, I mean, obviously, during the transition period, the people in transition, the incoming Trump administration is not in a position to do anything to inhibit with the Obama administration literally days before they transitioned out. So, again, as they begin to build relationships, there's nothing wrong with that. As they begin to build their own situational awareness with Russia in this case, I don't see an issue here.

WALLACE: OK. Let's turn to your day job. What's the latest on the Manchester bombing? Have they rolled up the network that was supporting the bombers, and what have you learned from this plot that will help you better protect the U.S. homeland?

KELLY: I mean, I don't know what the -- actually the better way to put it, I can't comment on whether they finish their investigations, or roll -- you know, completed rolling up on the network that weÃ¢ÂÂre dealing with. But I would just say that this is -- yes, IÃ¢ÂÂve said it many times, it really is a generational struggle. This is one tragedy in line with dozens of other tragedies in the world.

I mean, last week, you had Manchester, you had Egypt, you had Indonesia, you had the Philippines, all ISIS-inspired or ISIS-controlled terrorist attack.

WALLACE: Was there something different about this network and the way this was pulled off that says to you, gee, we've got to up our game?

KELLY: Well, itÃ¢ÂÂs this kind of -- in my view, there's kind of three types of terrorist attacks. The most sophisticated that we look at, that is against aviation, that's the hardest to do but it's the biggest payoff for these people.

Then you have kind of the middle of the road one, which I think this one was. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a network. It's hard to do. You have to construct a bomb and all, and then you have kind of the low-end where -- I mean, just as tragic but you have people running people over in trucks, that kind of thing.

But this is just the way terrorism is today and I think it will be around for many, many years to come. You know, the good news is those officials in the United Kingdom, Europe, around the world are relentless. They are just as relentless in terms of trying to prevent these things as the terrorists aren't trying to create them.

The good news is, for our country, we have not had an outside the United States terrorist attacks since 9/11. And that goes to the issue of those that fight our away game, thatÃ¢ÂÂs DOD, NSA, CIA, and those that fight the home game. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs DHS, FBI, local law enforcement.

WALLACE: Let me pick up on this, because part of the story this week was the leak of information about the bomber and the bombing that made its way into the U.S. media, and that set off this exchange.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I made clear to President Trump that the intelligence that is shared between our law enforcement agencies must remain secure.

REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: We take full responsibility for that. And we, obviously, regret that that happened.

WALLACE: How was this kind of sensitive information leaked to ""The New York Times""? And, General, why is it that whether it's politics or terror, our intelligence agencies, our law enforcement agencies, can't keep a secret?

KELLY: It's outrageous. When I call -- immediately after the attack, I called my counterpart in U.K., offered my condolences. By the way, the third time IÃ¢ÂÂve offered her, Amber Rudd, my condolences in 120 days. That's how frequent this kind of -- these terrorist attacks are happening.

Anyways, she rightfully and very graciously accepted the condolences and leaned into me on this leak. It's outrageous. I don't know why people do it. It jeopardizes not only investigations, it puts people's lives in jeopardy.

I don't why people do it, but they do. And that's the world we live in.

WALLACE: Let's get to what you're going to try to do to protect the homeland. There are a lot of crowded events in the summer, concerts, sporting events. How do you harden these soft targets like this concert? And do you have new thoughts because this person didn't get into the event, he was outside the event, what do you do about parameters?

KELLY: We -- one of the great things about America, there's many great things but we are a free and open society. And in many -- and I wouldn't change that at all. But that's also one of our vulnerabilities. People can live their lives day in and day out, privacy issues, all of that, it's a good thing. ItÃ¢ÂÂs what America is all about. But as I say, that is a vulnerability.

The good news is to all Americans, I mean, the good news is that local state law enforcement today -- not to even go down the issue of the FBI, DHS -- it's in their DNA now to harden. We are just about as hard as we can be. I don't know if there's a way to prevent these kinds of things in the kind of society we live in.

WALLACE: Let me pick up on that, because I want to play a clip of your testimony before Congress this week. Here it is.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KELLY: It's everywhere, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs -- you know, that's the nature of this threat that we are dealing with. As horrible as Manchester was, my expectation is weÃ¢ÂÂre going to see a lot more of that kind of attack.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: A lot more of that kind of attack, here in the U.S.?

KELLY: I think weÃ¢ÂÂre relatively -- we have no specific -- we have threats all the time, but no, right now, specific threat. But that goes to the fact that we are over here and not over there.

The fact is that it's the caliphate is being destroyed, that is Syria and Iraq, there are large numbers of returning fighters, Western Europe, and, you know, in many cases like this guy that did this thing in Manchester, heÃ¢ÂÂs a citizen of the U.K. In this case, heÃ¢ÂÂs a passport holder. I don't if the U.K. had any idea that he was outside -- that he was in Libya, but I think heÃ¢ÂÂs also traveled to other points.

The point is, they have a real threat and it's growing, itÃ¢ÂÂs metastasized, as fighters come back from the caliphate to be I believe to be more of this kind of thing.

The good news is, all decent people, all decent governments, and it doesn't matter whether we are politically close to them or not, all governments for the most part are sharing tremendous amounts of information, passport-type information, aviation, travel information. But, you know, people like this are below the radar.

WALLACE: I want to pick up on aviation because you are in the process of making some big decisions on aviation. And I want to do a lightning round, quick questions, quick answers.

Are you going to ban laptops from the cabin on all international flights both into and out of the U.S.?

KELLY: I might. That's a quick answer.

WALLACE: Yes, well, expand a little bit.

KELLY: Well, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a real threat. Numerous threats against aviation, that's really the thing that they are obsessed with, the terrorists, the idea of knocking down an airplane in flight, particularly if itÃ¢ÂÂs a U.S. carrier, particularly if it's full of mostly U.S. folks, people. It's real. You know that I implemented I think on the 21st of March a restriction on large electronic devices in the cabins from ten points of origin.

WALLACE: Right.

But there was talk, as you say, about all international flights both into and out of the U.S. When you say you might, when are you going to make that decision and whatÃ¢ÂÂs going to determine it?

KELLY: (INAUDIBLE) follow the intelligence. The very, very good news is that we are working incredibly close with friends and partners around the world. We're going to, and in the process of defining this, but we are going to raise the bar for generally speaking aviation security much higher than it is now.

So -- and thereÃ¢ÂÂs new technologies down the road, not too far down the road that we will rely on. But it is a real sophisticated threat and I will reserve that decision until we see where it's going.

WALLACE: Another lightning round question, I do need a quick answer here because weÃ¢ÂÂre running of time. The TSA is testing tighter screening of carry-ons, and the idea that people who bring their carry-ons are going to have to unpack them and put food in one bin, and electronics in the another bin, and paper in another bin.

Are you going to spread that nationwide and whatÃ¢ÂÂs that going to do to the screening lines?

KELLY: Yes, I mean, the reason weÃ¢ÂÂve done, TSA, of course, works for me. The reason we've done that is because of -- people trying to avoid the $25 or $50 or whatever it is to check a bag are now stuffing your carry-on bags to the point of, you know -- well, they can't get any more in there. So, the more you stuff in there, the less the TSA professionals that are looking at what's in those bags through the monitors, they can't tell what's in the bags anymore. So, if you put --

WALLACE: So, are you going to do that nationwide?

KELLY: We might, and likely will.

WALLACE: Soon?

KELLY: Well, what weÃ¢ÂÂre doing now is working out the tactics, techniques and procedures, if you will, in a few airports to find out exactly how to do that with the least amount of inconvenience to the traveler.

WALLACE: A couple final questions I want to ask about the travel ban. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling this week continuing the stay on President Trump's revised travel ban -- and I want to put up -- the chief judge called it, the revised travel ban: an executive order that in text speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.

Mr. Secretary, judge after judge has said that this is a Muslim man that violates the Constitution.

KELLY: They are dead wrong.

WALLACE: Well, I mean, you say that, but they are the ones who were --

KELLY: They are wrong. Remember the seven, now six countries? These were the same countries identified by the Obama administration that we should be extra cautious about and backed up, you know, by the United States Congress. That's where those seven countries came from.

The fact is that in those countries, we have very little ability to actually verify, vet the people that are coming out of those countries. So, what the president and it's not a travel ban, remember. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the travel pause. What the president said, for 90 days, we were going to pause in terms of people from those countries coming to the United States that would give me time to look at additional vetting to see --

WALLACE: OK. I want to pick up on that and why youÃ¢ÂÂre even talking about the travel ban, because I want to put some numbers on. Take a look at this.

The first executive order that was issued on January 27th banned citizens from seven nations from entering the U.S. for 90 days, suspended the refugee program for 120 days, as you say, a pause, while you set up an extreme vetting program. It's now been 121 days since that first order. So, why don't you have the program in place?

KELLY: We are actually implementing it. The irony here is, had it stood, we would have had the 90 days to study. WeÃ¢ÂÂre not even studying what would be procedures, because we are enjoined and can't do that. In the meantime --

WALLACE: You can't study extreme vetting?

KELLY: No. WeÃ¢ÂÂre -- the irony again is we can't study it, but IÃ¢ÂÂm just guessing, and implementing.

But we are going to find implement ways to determine who this -- an individual is, and remember, most of these countries have no passports. They have no police. They have no intelligence. Many of the countries in question don't even have a U.S. embassy there to help us vet. The U.N. will tell you it's almost impossible to vet these people from these countries because there are no passports and all the rest of it.

We have to figure out a way to determine who they are and why they come into the United States. Otherwise, weÃ¢ÂÂre guessing. And this president and John Kelly doesn't want to guess when it comes to national security and protection of the U.S. population.

WALLACE: Secretary Kelly, thank you. Thanks for sharing part of your holiday weekend with us.

KELLY: Absolutely. Thanks.

WALLACE: Up next, new reports that Jared Kushner attempted to set up a back channel between Russia and the Trump transition. WeÃ¢ÂÂll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the expanding Russia probe.

Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the continuous leaks in Washington? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HILLARY CLINTON, D-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We were furious about the past presidential election of a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Hillary Clinton talking about Richard Nixon in her commencement speech at Wellesley College, but clearly taking a shot at President Trump. By the way, Nixon resigned before he was actually impeached.

And it's time now for our Sunday group: the head of Heritage Action for America, Michael Needham, Charles Lane of The Washington Post, Gerald Seib from The Wall Street Journal, and National Security Council staffer, Gillian Turner.

And just to catch you up, President Trump returns home to reports that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with the Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, in December, and that they discussed setting up a secret secure channel between the Trump transition and the Kremlin. That communications link reportedly to be based in a Russian diplomatic facility in Russia.

A source close to the Trump administration tells me the conversation did take place but he says it was the ambassador who proposed the back channel, not Kushner, so the Russian military could talk with Trump advisors about the situation in Syria and the source points out that the secure link was never set up.

So, with that as a preface, Gerry, your reaction to the Kushner story, and how does this complicate the already complicated investigation of links between the Kremlin and the Trump transition?

GERALD F. SEIB, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, look, I mean, back channels are not unusual, they are not unprecedented. This one might have seemed perfectly innocent. Two problems though with it. One is, this happened during the transition, it seems to violate as you suggested earlier in the show the only one president at a time rule. And the second one is itÃ¢ÂÂs Russia, after a campaign in which the Russian connection to the campaign, the Russian interference in the campaign was a big issue.

And I think the fact that it was at a time when people were looking for whether there were going to be signs of special favors for Russia as a result of help they might have given President Trump, then-President-elect Trump during the campaign, that's what makes this a big story, is the context of the conversation as much as the actual content.

WALLACE: Michael, I want to ask you, one, whether it's a big story, and, secondly, about the talk we are hearing, that is just rampant in Washington today about major changes in the White House that theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to set up a rapid response operation to deal with all the incoming leaks, that the president has hired at least one criminal defense lawyer and may be process of hiring a team and the staff is urging the president to let the lawyers vet his tweets. I mean, it really does sound like theyÃ¢ÂÂre going on a war footing on this.

MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Yes, I don't know if it's a major story, there are several investigations going on. They probably should be allowed to work their course. It's kind of exhausting reading some of these new stories and trying to figure out what did you read three weeks ago thatÃ¢ÂÂs just being recycled, versus what new?

I think it's smart for the administration to try to put this stuff to the side, have, you know, a team that looks at these issues, and another team that looks at a lot of real policy issues, which are closer to the American people. You have the most conservative, exciting budget that's come out in a decade.

WALLACE: WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to get to the agenda in the next segment.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: I mean, at the very least, it seems dumb.

NEEDHAM: Clearly, the optics of these are awful, and I think that especially when you have people who are new to the political system coming in and getting advice from a guy in Mike Flynn who probably didn't show the best judgment through a lot of this, you know, dumb might be a good word for it. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know. You know, I think Kushner said a couple of weeks ago that he was happy to participate with the Senate investigation. He said heÃ¢ÂÂs happy to participate with this investigation.

You are at a disadvantage when you are the focus of an investigation and your lawyers are saying, don't participate, don't comment, and everyone else in the country seems more than eager to talk about it. So, I think a little prudence in keeping our mouth shut while we let the investigations play out is probably fair and weÃ¢ÂÂll see what comes up in them.

WALLACE: You talk about the fact that they're all the stories and sometimes it's hard to remember what you've heard this week and what you heard last week. And this gets to the question of leaks. I asked our staff to put together, let's put it up on the screen, a list of the headlines from just the last two weeks. This is just Sunday two weeks ago until today. And as you can see, there's been a torrent of disclosures from intelligence and law enforcement officials.

Gillian, as somebody who worked in the government, have you ever seen anything like this? And, you know, the conservatives talk about a deep state, that there are people embedded in law enforcement and embedded in the intelligence community that are trying to bring this president down. It sure seems like it's true.

GILLIAN TURNER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: So, to me on the question of leaks, it seems that without a doubt leaks of information today are the number one threat to U.S. national security interest across the globe. And I think for evidence of that, we need look no further than the very public reprimand, we the United States had to endure from Britain earlier this week, in the wake of the Manchester attacks. A reminder that the British-U.S. intelligence cooperation, relationship, is one of the closest that has ever existed. And in my lifetime, in government and policy, I have not seen something so public, so public a risk (ph)

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Most of these leaks arenÃ¢ÂÂt about national security. They are about Trump's political security.

TURNER: Yes. And so, this gets to the question of the deep state. So, IÃ¢ÂÂm somebody who likes to push back against the narrative having been a civil servant in the government. Again, in the national security community is different than the political community, the rest of the policy community. But I will say that from I have seen and experienced, it does not exist.

There is not this liberal --

WALLACE: How do you define this?

TURNER: There isnÃ¢ÂÂt a liberal core of people -- put it this way, Chris, for a hard fact, more than 50 percent of the federal workforce today is made up of people that joined the government prior to President Bush's tenure in office. So, the idea that these are Obama holdovers is simply not true, it's not the case.

I think that when we talk about why individuals leak information, the explanations are as varied as human beingsÃ¢ÂÂ psychology. So, for example, a lot of things we are seeing leaked about the president are probably being leaked by his senior staff to hurt one another. That's not unique to the Trump administration.

WALLACE: We ask you for questions for the panel and we got some different reactions in this question of leaks.

Adri Ane sent us on Facebook: Do whistleblowers hold a vital role in the health of a democracy holding those in power to accountability?

But chuck Coo had a different take: Simple question. If our intelligence agencies are as good as advertised, why can't they find the leakers?

Chuck, how do you answer both of them about leaks?

CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, as a member of the press, and is a believer in the role of the media and holding government accountable, IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to come out against leaks, because, you know, for all the leaks that may cause this or that official trouble, there's going to be another one that does play an important role in accountability.

But going back to what Gillian said, I think part of the reason that these leaks are flowing so uncontrollably to the viewerÃ¢ÂÂs question is the factional struggle within this administration. You know, we have this famous dispute between Bannon and Kushner that supposedly was papered over. But I wouldn't be surprised if, you know, those were present two currents, to put it politely, within the White House that are trying to get bad stories out about one another.

And this goes to your point about the staff shakeup and so on and so forth. You can shake up the staff all you want, but if man at the top is not laying out a clear and consistent line, is not himself modeling behavior, for example, by not blowing an Israeli source in a meeting with a foreign government, that sets the tone that this stuff is not really on, then it will continue.

NEEDHAM: I take your point about the responsibility of the press and how leaks play into as it requires a responsible press also. That when James Fallows of The Atlantic today put side-by-side The Washington Post in The New York Times and how they treat, I think it was three unnamed sources in the White House talking about Jared Kushner and his desire to be here and stay here, this is not an urgent story. This is not something thatÃ¢ÂÂs getting out there.

I don't think you see in the press, The Times and The Washington Post, the way they are playing this kind of using leakers to try to unearth the truth and taking two months like --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: We need to --

NEEDHAM: ItÃ¢ÂÂs kind of getting ridiculous.

WALLACE: We need to -- because weÃ¢ÂÂre going to run out of time. Let me simply say, we're just receiving information. ItÃ¢ÂÂs people who had sworn, oftentimes taken legal oaths not to divulge the information, they are the ones putting it out. WeÃ¢ÂÂre just the recipients.

All right. We have to take a break here. WeÃ¢ÂÂll see you a little later.

When we come back, Senators Dick Durbin and Bill Cassidy. Is the president's agenda, both his new budget and the new effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare in trouble?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, President Trump releases his budget.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My administration is laying a foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve American greatness.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: But does it have any chance of getting through Congress?

Two key senators join us next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: A look outside the beltway of the Indianapolis Motor speedway, home to this weekend's Indianapolis 500.

Back from his first foreign trip, President Trump's focus will now shift to his domestic agenda, his new budget and a bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare.

Joining us to discuss the president's priorities from Springfield, Illinois, the SenateÃ¢ÂÂs number two Democrat, Dick Durbin. And here in Washington, Louisiana senator and doctor, Bill Cassidy, whoÃ¢ÂÂs on both the Senate Finance and Health Committees.

Well, senators, before we get to the Trump agenda, IÃ¢ÂÂve got to ask you about the big story in Washington. This weekend, the Jared Kushner story, discussions about setting up a possible back channel with Russia.

Senator Durbin, what's wrong with that?

SEN. DICK DURBIN, D-ILLINOIS: The bottom line, of course, is we now have a special counsel in Bob Mueller. I have the highest level of confidence in him. And I hope that he will follow all the evidence, all the leads, and all the suggestions. And IÃ¢ÂÂm sure he will.

WALLACE: Do you have any specific comment about the Kushner conversation and whether or je should keep his security clearance?

DURBIN: Well, of course not. I mean this is a rumor at this point and whether it is something that should be followed up on, IÃ¢ÂÂll trust Bob Mueller's judgment.

WALLACE: Senator Cassidy, are you troubled by this?

SEN. BILL CASSIDY, R-LOUISIANA: I agree with DickÃ¢ÂÂs assessment. And IÃ¢ÂÂll say, when you speak to folks back home, voters across the nation, theyÃ¢ÂÂre more concerned about their climbing health care premiums and the need to have jobs with better wages and better benefits. This will play out. We will know eventually. Right now Americans need help with their premiums.

WALLACE: Well, you know what then gentlemen, let's switch to health care. And the Congressional Budget Office, non-partisan, released its score of the House bill this week. And let's put the numbers up on the screen. It would reduce the deficit $119 billion over ten years, but 23 million more people would be uninsured by 2026. The cost of insurance, according to the CBO, for a 64-year-old earning $27,000 a year would increase from $1,700 a year under ObamaCare to more than $13,000 under the GOP bill. Here's what Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said this week.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-NY, MINORITY LEADER: Unless youÃ¢ÂÂre a healthy millionaire, Trumpcare is a nightmare. This report ought to be the final nail in the coffin of the Republican effort to sabotage our health care system.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Senator Cassidy, is Schumer right?

CASSIDY: So the Senate will write its own bill. And it shouldn't be the final coffin because right now there's families sitting around their kitchen table, theyÃ¢ÂÂre play $20,000, $30,000 and $40,000 a year for premiums and there's about to be a 40 percent increase in many states in these premiums. Cassidy-Collins, a bill IÃ¢ÂÂve introduced with Susan Collins, we have four co-sponsors.

WALLACE: Yes, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to get into that in a --

CASSIDY: But that said, actually would -- would -- would meet that familyÃ¢ÂÂs needs and I think it should be a place we go and those families are asking us to address those issues.

WALLACE: So -- so what would you say to Americans? How should they regard the House bill?

CASSIDY: The House product, the Senate will have its own product. We will go to conference. But I think the Senate product, I'm hopeful, will be more likely to address their needs.

WALLACE: Senator Durbin, I know what youÃ¢ÂÂre going to say, and the CBO certainly indicates there are problem with repeal and replace, but ObamaCare has its own problems. You heard Senator Cassidy mentioned some of them. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City just announced this week that it has lost $100 million through 2016 and that it is going to pull out of exchanges. That means that in 25 counties in western Missouri they may have no insurer at all. DoesnÃ¢ÂÂt something have to be done dramatically?

DURBIN: Well, it should be. But first we ought to have an administration that supports our health care system. What the Trump administration has done since day one is to find ways to cut off support for our current health care system, lack of advertising, for example, to bring new people on board so we have larger insurance pools and lower premiums. We have to have an effort made to sustain the current system while we repair it. We shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be sabotaging it.

WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait, wait, senator --

DURBIN: But letÃ¢ÂÂs look at the bottom line here. What the Republicans --

WALLACE: Senator Durbin, let me just point out, when Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City says theyÃ¢ÂÂve lost $100 million in 2016, you can't blame that on Trump. He wasn't president.

DURBIN: No, of course it is not a situation where the system we have is perfect, and it isn't. I voted for it. And it needs to be repaired. And I think Bill Cassidy and Susan Collins are at least willing to sit down in a constructive fashion and deal with that. Bill and I have had conversations about that. I'm sorry that the two of them are not in the room with the 13 apostles that Senator McConnellÃ¢ÂÂs chosen to come up with the Republicans plan. I wish Bill and Susan were in there.

WALLACE: All right, let -- let -- let me bring Senator Cassidy back, because let's talk about the Collins, Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine, and Cassidy plan. And here are some o"	0
382	"Chachi can now apologize to Joannie for being so rude. Scott Baio, 56, was killed when the single-engine Cessna he was in crashed into the side of a hill in Louisiana. Baio was headed to Mar-A-Lago to barbecue shrimp and play gold with President Trump.

BaioÃ¢ÂÂs wife, Raylene, wasnÃ¢ÂÂt on the plane but was checked into St TimothyÃ¢ÂÂs on a suicide watch after the news sent her into a breakdown. Spokesmen for several actors who wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be caught dead in a film with Baio said that he was Ã¢ÂÂreally special as ChachiÃ¢ÂÂ and he Ã¢ÂÂsure did do a nice job with Charles in Charge.Ã¢ÂÂ

Baio, wildly successful as an actor since the ripe age of 13, says he saved every dime he ever made so he could live the lavish lifestyle of jetting across the country to golf with famous and powerful people. Unfortunately, that ended with a net worth of about $3.5 million and a whole lot of that was tied up in that nice house of his, so Baio was forced to go Cessna instead, which only would have gotten him there slightly faster than that new Kia Sorento heÃ¢ÂÂs been sporting.

Baio will be missed by many. His ability to retweet things in support of our glorious president without even bothering to care what they were truly drove the social media movement to get Trump elected. When he heard the news that Baio was killed, Trump asked for a moment of silence in the dining room during his morning coffee and strudel. He hasnÃ¢ÂÂt personally responded but Jeff Derpinger of the WHOIP told Freedom Crossroads correspondent Louis Leweigh:

Ã¢ÂÂThe President was saddened by the news once we reminded him that Scott was once Ã¢ÂÂChachi.Ã¢ÂÂ He said he wished he knew the kid was coming; he would have sent the jet.Ã¢ÂÂ

To clear it up, libtards, he would probably send the company jet and not Air Force One. Maybe one of the smaller planes like the Secretary of State gets but nothing bigger than that. BaioÃ¢ÂÂs remains are scattered with the wreckage, with slammed nose first into a cliff face. The FCC said the pilot probably got disoriented in a cloud bank and came at a 30-degree downward angle directly into solid quartz with a touch of limestone. The plane fell nearly 1400 feet to the basin below where very little was recognizable.

Baio had no known connection to the Clintons Ã¢ÂÂ Trey Gowdy is investigating."	1
383	"UPDATE 4/12/2018: Yes, Fox did accidentally put up the wrong poll graphic, but Fox has since pointed out that the confusing graphic wasn't actually showing that Fox is the least trusted network. Instead, what the graphic intended to do was to compare CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to Trump. The graphic asks who people trust more, CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, and Fox News or Trump. When looking at it this way, people trust all three networks more than they trust Trump.

During a Fox news segment in which Republican strategist Frank Luntz thought the media should give Trump more credit for the nation's economic ""clear recovery,"" someone behind the scenes made a boo boo.

When host Howard Kurtz asked for a poll to be put up on the screen that asks if the media reports fake news, viewers got a look at the wrong poll Ã¢ÂÂ one put out by Monmouth University that asks people which network they trust more, CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News.

Not surprising but a knee-slapper nonetheless, the graphic for the poll showed that people trusted CNN most, at 48%, followed by MSNBC at 45%. Fox came in last place with a mere 30% of those polled thinking that the network was trustworthy.

Kurtz quickly said, ""This is not the graphic we're looking for Ã¢ÂÂ hold off. Take that down please!""

384	"HEMPSTEAD, New York (CNN) -- Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain and Democrat Sen. Barack Obama faced off at Hofstra University Wednesday night in their last debate before Election Day. Bob Schieffer of CBS was the moderator. Here is a transcript of the debate.

Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain debate face to face Wednesday night.

Schieffer: Good evening. And welcome to the third and last presidential debate of 2008, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News.

The rules tonight are simple. The subject is domestic policy. I will divide the next hour-and-a-half into nine-minute segments.

I will ask a question at the beginning of each segment. Each candidate will then have two minutes to respond, and then we'll have a discussion.

I'll encourage them to ask follow-up questions of each other. If they do not, I will.

The audience behind me has promised to be quiet, except at this moment, when we welcome Barack Obama and John McCain.

Gentlemen, welcome.

By now, we've heard all the talking points, so let's try to tell the people tonight some things that they -- they haven't heard. Let's get to it.

Another very bad day on Wall Street, as both of you know. Both of you proposed new plans this week to address the economic crisis.

Sen. McCain, you proposed a $52 billion plan that includes new tax cuts on capital gains, tax breaks for seniors, write-offs for stock losses, among other things.

Sen. Obama, you proposed $60 billion in tax cuts for middle- income and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new spending for public works projects to create jobs.

I will ask both of you: Why is your plan better than his?

Sen. McCain, you go first.

McCain: Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you.

And thanks to Hofstra.

And, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you.

It's good to see you again, Sen. Obama.

Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry. They're hurting, and they're angry. They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry.

And they want this country to go in a new direction. And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.

But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.

Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.

The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.

I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.

Now, we have allocated $750 billion. Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.

Now, I know the criticism of this.

Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes? That paid their mortgage payments? It doesn't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned. And so we've got to reverse this. We ought to put the homeowners first. And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.

Schieffer: All right. Sen. Obama?

Obama: Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Sen. McCain again, and thank you, Bob.

I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And the financial rescue plan that Sen. McCain and I supported is an important first step. And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up. Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.

And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out. But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class. Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis. So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.

Number one, let's focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America.

Number two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're experiencing a crisis.

Now Sen. McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners. That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.

I disagree with Sen. McCain in how to do it, because the way Sen. McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less. And we don't want to waste taxpayer money. And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.

Last point I want to make, though. We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with. We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away. We've got to fix our health care system and we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.

Schieffer: All right. Would you like to ask him a question?

McCain: No. I would like to mention that a couple days ago Sen. Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.

Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day. And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.

You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.

Now Sen. Obama talks about the very, very rich. Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.

And I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income. Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses. That's 16 million jobs in America. And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.

Schieffer: Is that what you want to do?

McCain: That's what Joe believes.

Obama: He has been watching ads of Sen. McCain's. Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do. I think tax policy is a major difference between Sen. McCain and myself. And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.

Now, Sen. McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America. Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.

What I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent. If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. Not one dime.

And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Sen. McCain does.

Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, ""Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.""

And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now. And that requires us to make some important choices.

The last point I'll make about small businesses. Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. They produce the most jobs.

McCain: You know, when Sen. Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around. In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Sen. Obama, and let him spread the wealth around.

I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around. You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.

The whole premise behind Sen. Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around. I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.

Who -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now? Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around.

I'm not going to...

Obama: OK. Can I...

McCain: We're not going to do that in my administration.

Obama: If I can answer the question. Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans. Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order...

McCain: We're talking about Joe the plumber.

Obama: ... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.

Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.

So, look, nobody likes taxes. I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself. But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it.

McCain: Nobody likes taxes. Let's not raise anybody's taxes. OK?

Obama: Well, I don't mind paying a little more.

McCain: The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world. Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent. Ireland, it's 11 percent.

Where are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?

We need to cut the business tax rate in America. We need to encourage business.

Now, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes. We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around.

Schieffer: All right. Let's go to another topic. It's related. So if you have other things you want to say, you can get back to that.

This question goes to you first, Sen. Obama.

We found out yesterday that this year's deficit will reach an astounding record high $455 billion. Some experts say it could go to $1 trillion next year.

Both of you have said you want to reduce the deficit, but the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers on both of your proposals and they say the cost of your proposals, even with the savings you claim can be made, each will add more than $200 billion to the deficit.

Aren't you both ignoring reality? Won't some of the programs you are proposing have to be trimmed, postponed, even eliminated?

Give us some specifics on what you're going to cut back.

Sen. Obama?

Obama: Well, first of all, I think it's important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that's important to understand.

But there is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and we're going to have to make some adjustments.

Now, what I've done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut. I haven't made a promise about...

Schieffer: But you're going to have to cut some of these programs, certainly.

Obama: Absolutely. So let me get to that. What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go. Every dollar that I've proposed, I've proposed an additional cut so that it matches.

And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies. It doesn't -- under the Medicare plan -- it doesn't help seniors get any better. It's not improving our health care system. It's just a giveaway.

We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work. And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don't work, we should cut. Programs that we need, we should make them work better.

Now, what is true is that Sen. McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people. I mentioned health care earlier.

If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.

If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we're borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia.

If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.

But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we're not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways.

And we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means.

Schieffer: Time's up.

Senator?

McCain: Well, thank you, Bob. I just want to get back to this home ownership. During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation.

And they went out and bought up these mortgages. And people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money.

And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Sen. Clinton not too long ago.

So, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth.

Schieffer: But what...

McCain: But -- OK. All right.

Schieffer: The question was, what are you going to cut?

McCain: Energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy independence. We have to have nuclear power. We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much. It's wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which Sen. Obama has opposed.

And the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America.

OK, what -- what would I cut? I would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, OK? Some people say that's a hatchet. That's a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, OK?

Because we've got -- we have presided over the largest increase -- we've got to have a new direction for this country. We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.

Government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we're giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China.

I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending. I know how to eliminate programs.

Schieffer: Which ones?

McCain: I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program. Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.

I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Sen. Obama supported those subsidies.

I would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil.

I know how to save billions. I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.

But I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill. Sen. Obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects...

Schieffer: Time's up.

McCain: ... including $3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown. That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork.

Schieffer: Time's up.

Obama: Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze. It sounds good. It's proposed periodically. It doesn't happen.

And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all. There are some programs that are underfunded. And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.

Now, Sen. McCain talks a lot about earmarks. That's one of the centerpieces of his campaign.

Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget. There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. But it's not going to solve the problem.

Now, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we're doing going forward.

When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion. It has doubled over the last eight years.

Obama: And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.

So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit. And, frankly, Sen. McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.

We've got to take this in a new direction, that's what I propose as president.

Schieffer: Do either of you think you can balance the budget in four years? You have said previously you thought you could, Sen. McCain.

McCain: Sure I do. And let me tell you...

Schieffer: You can still do that?

McCain: Yes. Sen. Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago. I'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.

Sen. Obama talks about voting for budgets. He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year. Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget. It's completely out of control.

The mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City. They're doing it all over America because they have to. Because they have to balance their budgets. I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will...

Schieffer: In four years?

McCain: ... reduce this -- I can -- we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence.

Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction. I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending.

Sen. Obama talks about the budgets I voted for. He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed.

He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed. So the fact is, let's look at our records, Sen. Obama. Let's look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations.

I have fought against spending. I have fought against special interests. I have fought for reform. You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.

Schieffer: Barack.

Obama: Well, there's a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it. First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party. I support...

McCain: An overwhelming vote.

Obama: I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers. Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union. I support clean coal technology. Doesn't make me popular with environmentalists. So I've got a history of reaching across the aisle.

Now with respect to a couple of things Sen. McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Sen. McCain keeps on making.

Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.

Now, you've shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that. But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing. And it hasn't worked.

And I think the American people understand it hasn't worked. We need to move in a new direction.

Schieffer: All right...

McCain: Let me just say, Bob.

Schieffer: OK. About 30 seconds.

McCain: OK. But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration. I have disagreed with leaders of my own party. I've got the scars to prove it.

Whether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time. Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs, importation. Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights. Whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 Commission.

I have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate.

Schieffer: All right.

McCain: Sen. Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn't very convincing.

Schieffer: All right. We're going to move to another question and the topic is leadership in this campaign. Both of you pledged to take the high road in this campaign yet it has turned very nasty.

Schieffer: Sen. Obama, your campaign has used words like ""erratic,"" ""out of touch,"" ""lie,"" ""angry,"" ""losing his bearings"" to describe Sen. McCain.

Sen. McCain, your commercials have included words like ""disrespectful,"" ""dangerous,"" ""dishonorable,"" ""he lied."" Your running mate said he ""palled around with terrorists.""

Are each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say to each other's face what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns have said about each other?

And, Sen. McCain, you're first.

McCain: Well, this has been a tough campaign. It's been a very tough campaign. And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Sen. Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.

When Sen. Obama was first asked, he said, ""Any place, any time,"" the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas. So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.

And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough. And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns. But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.

One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful.

And, Sen. Obama, you didn't repudiate those remarks. Every time there's been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them. I hope that Sen. Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.

So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign. This is a tough campaign. And it's a matter of fact that Sen. Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history. And I can prove it.

And, Sen. Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't keep your word.

And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Sen. Clinton and said, ""I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,"" you didn't tell the American people the truth because you didn't.

And that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part. Now we have the highest spending by Sen. Obama's campaign than any time since Watergate.

Schieffer: Time's up. All right.

Obama: Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough. I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Sen. McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine.

And 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative.

McCain: It's not true.

Obama: It absolutely is true. And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.

And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy. That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.

The notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks.

What the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies. And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.

Sen. McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.

And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.

And that is something that I would welcome. But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.

McCain: Well, if you'll turn on the television, as I -- I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.

Obama: Congratulations.

McCain: Every other ad -- ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan. And any objective observer has said it's not true. You're running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research. I don't.

You're running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration. So the fact is that Sen. Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.

And of course, I've been talking about the economy. Of course, I've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not going to spread his wealth around. I'm going to let him keep his wealth. And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.

That's what my campaign is all about and that's what it'll continue to be all about.

But again, I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman...

Obama: I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign's awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like ""terrorist"" and ""kill him,"" and that you're running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say ""Hold on a second, that's kind of out of line.""

And I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.

Now...

McCain: You've got to read what he said...

(CROSSTALK)

Obama: Let -- let -- let...

McCain: You've got to read what he said.

Obama: Let me -- let me complete...

Schieffer: Go ahead.

Obama: ... my response. I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we don't think that comparison is appropriate.

And, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.

The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth. And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that's what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign.

McCain: I cannot...

Obama: We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...

McCain: We do and I hope...

Obama: ... talking about it this evening.

McCain: Sure.

Obama: But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues. What we're talking about...

McCain: Well, let me just say I would...

Schieffer: (inaudible)

McCain: Let me just say categorically I'm proud of the people that come to our rallies. Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples. You know that. And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.

But to somehow say that group of young women who said ""Military wives for McCain"" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say ""World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,"" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens.

And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Sen. Obama, that I'm not happy about either.

In fact, some T-shirts that are very...

Obama: John, I...

McCain: ... unacceptable. So the point is -- the point is that I have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether they've been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do that.

But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on. I haven't.

Obama: Well, look, Bob, as I said...

Schieffer: I mean, do you take issue with that?

Obama: You know, here's what I would say. I mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other's campaigns. I su"	0

Mr. Ayers, who spent the 1970's as a fugitive in the Weather Underground, was sitting in the kitchen of his big turn-of-the-19th-century stone house in the Hyde Park district of Chicago. The long curly locks in his Wanted poster are shorn, though he wears earrings. He still has tattooed on his neck the rainbow-and-lightning Weathermen logo that appeared on letters taking responsibility for bombings. And he still has the ebullient, ingratiating manner, the apparently intense interest in other people, that made him a charismatic figure in the radical student movement.

Now he has written a book, ''Fugitive Days'' (Beacon Press, September). Mr. Ayers, who is 56, calls it a memoir, somewhat coyly perhaps, since he also says some of it is fiction. He writes that he participated in the bombings of New York City Police Headquarters in 1970, of the Capitol building in 1971, the Pentagon in 1972. But Mr. Ayers also seems to want to have it both ways, taking responsibility for daring acts in his youth, then deflecting it.

''Is this, then, the truth?,'' he writes. ''Not exactly. Although it feels entirely honest to me.''

But why would someone want to read a memoir parts of which are admittedly not true? Mr. Ayers was asked.

''Obviously, the point is it's a reflection on memory,'' he answered. ''It's true as I remember it.''"	0

With only a month to go before the big day, Donald Trump and his team's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate.

As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process, the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication.

It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day.

So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, The Rockettes (the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy), and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big (and still growing) list of major artists who definitely won't be performing on the day.

Here is who has declined so far:

This rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team, who claimed that Trump would be ""the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration.""

That sounded pretty definite. Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: ""Incorrect. He will NOT be performing.""

John added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian, where he said: ""I don't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign.

""I'm British. I've met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I'm not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you.""

In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance.

Ice T

An odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality.

But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did.

He wrote on Twitter: ""I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I didn't pick up and blocked the number.""

Celine Dion

According to reports, Celine Dion didn't decline Trump because she didn't want to perform, but more because she was just too busy.

Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (20 January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans.

John Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start. Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony, he told the BBC: ""Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate.

""We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.""

Adam Lambert

Adam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues.

""I don't think I would take money on that one,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.""

The Dixie Chicks

Speaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. ""No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now,"" he said.

""If anyone does do it, I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures. Because it's probably the last cheque they're ever going to get."""	1

Having teenagers act as figureheads for a movement has a certain quality that has not gone unnoticed in the wake of the March for Our Lives rally on Saturday. Judge too harshly, and you are attacking a kid who has balanced trauma with homework. Amplifying students such as Emma GonzÃÂ¡lez has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.

GonzÃÂ¡lez, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on ValentineÃ¢ÂÂs Day.

Gun-control advocates have held up GonzÃÂ¡lez as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.

Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.

A doctored animation of GonzÃÂ¡lez tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, GonzÃÂ¡lez is ripping apart a gun-range target.

The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.

The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.

He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading Ã¢ÂÂ#VorwÃÂ¤rts!Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ the German word for Ã¢ÂÂforwardÃ¢ÂÂ and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.

Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was Ã¢ÂÂsatire.Ã¢ÂÂ It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.

The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.

Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: Ã¢ÂÂJust a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),Ã¢ÂÂ referencing a user named Ã¢ÂÂLinda NRA SupporterÃ¢ÂÂ who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.

Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur Ã¢ÂÂ Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018

MoynihanÃ¢ÂÂs tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.

Generally, one form of criticism of GonzÃÂ¡lez and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.

Share this article Share

They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the rightÃ¢ÂÂs criticism of HoggÃ¢ÂÂs insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.

The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first Ã¢ÂÂtop newsÃ¢ÂÂ video that appears in a YouTube search for Ã¢ÂÂDavid HoggÃ¢ÂÂ is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to not just go after this kid,Ã¢ÂÂ host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.

Other elements of GonzÃÂ¡lez have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off.

For instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket.

Ã¢ÂÂEmma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,Ã¢ÂÂ one meme shared on RedditÃ¢ÂÂs conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. GonzÃÂ¡lezÃ¢ÂÂs father migrated from Cuba to the United States.

As The PostÃ¢ÂÂs Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).

Ã¢ÂÂThis is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet donÃ¢ÂÂt speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,Ã¢ÂÂ said a post on KingÃ¢ÂÂs campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of GonzÃÂ¡lez at the podium Saturday.

A self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics Ã¢ÂÂ a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.

Ã¢ÂÂThe initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now itÃ¢ÂÂs represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. Ã¢ÂÂBoycott this, boycott that.Ã¢ÂÂ ItÃ¢ÂÂs detracting from the actual discussions,Ã¢ÂÂ Kashuv told The PostÃ¢ÂÂs Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.

Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.

But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.

HoggÃ¢ÂÂs comments at the rally were Ã¢ÂÂegregious and inflammatory,Ã¢ÂÂ Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying HoggÃ¢ÂÂs use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers would be unknown if their classmates were still alive, saved by a gun-carrying officer.

Conservatives, who have often asserted that high school students have limited understanding and legitimacy in the gun debate, have taken a shine to the Parkland student.

Ã¢ÂÂYou will include Kyle Kashuv in your story, yes?Ã¢ÂÂ Baldwin asked The Post in a direct message on Twitter.

BritainÃ¢ÂÂs Queen Elizabeth II has lost the last descendant of her original corgi after 14-year-old Willow was put down at Windsor Castle on Sunday following a battle with cancer, according to UK media reports.

Willow was the last in a long line of royal corgis owned by BritainÃ¢ÂÂs longest-serving monarch, reported British newspaper the Daily Mail.

Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the dogÃ¢ÂÂs death, telling CNN it was a private matter.

The QueenÃ¢ÂÂs fondness for corgis is well known, with Willow and the monarch even appearing beside James Bond actor Daniel Craig for a sketch shown during the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony.

While the Queen still reportedly owns several other dogs, Willow was the only remaining descendant of Susan, the original corgi given to then-Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944.

She received Susan as a gift after becoming attached to her father King George VIÃ¢ÂÂs corgi called Dookie, the Daily Mail reported.

Since then, she has owned dozens of the breed, known for its distinctive short legs and standing-up ears.

Such was Queen ElilzabethÃ¢ÂÂs attachment to Susan, she reportedly took the dog on honeymoon with Prince Philip in 1947.

More recently, Prince HarryÃ¢ÂÂs fiancÃÂ©e Meghan Markle appeared to have won over the beloved canines.

Ã¢ÂÂI spent the last 33 years being barked at. This one walks in and absolutely nothing, just wagging tails,Ã¢ÂÂ the QueenÃ¢ÂÂs grandson said in a BBC interview in November, gesturing to Meghan.

By PolitiFact staff

PolitiFact is annotating the second presidential debate at Washington University. We will be posting the transcript and our annotations through the night. Follow us on Medium and check back regularly to see our commentary.

RADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.

COOPER: Thank you very much for being here. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so youÃ¢ÂÂll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?

QUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as studentsÃ¢ÂÂ homework, do you feel youÃ¢ÂÂre modeling appropriate and positive behavior for todayÃ¢ÂÂs youth?

CLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that thatÃ¢ÂÂs a very good question, because IÃ¢ÂÂve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.

And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because weÃ¢ÂÂre good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them into working on behalf of our country.

I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why the slogan of my campaign is Ã¢ÂÂStronger Together,Ã¢ÂÂ because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals Ã¢ÂÂ and IÃ¢ÂÂve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.

If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, thereÃ¢ÂÂs nothing in my opinion that America canÃ¢ÂÂt do. So thatÃ¢ÂÂs why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, IÃ¢ÂÂm hoping to earn your vote, IÃ¢ÂÂm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.

I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because thatÃ¢ÂÂs, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.

TRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. IÃ¢ÂÂve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that IÃ¢ÂÂve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe IÃ¢ÂÂm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.

TRUMP: And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, itÃ¢ÂÂs a one-sided transaction where weÃ¢ÂÂre giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, weÃ¢ÂÂve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.

When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs in business and trade, where weÃ¢ÂÂre doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. ItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to believe. Inconceivable.

You say whoÃ¢ÂÂs making these deals? WeÃ¢ÂÂre going the make great deals. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to have a strong border. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.

But I want to do things that havenÃ¢ÂÂt been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. ItÃ¢ÂÂs called make America great again.

COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for todayÃ¢ÂÂs youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?

TRUMP: No, I didnÃ¢ÂÂt say that at all. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think you understood what was Ã¢ÂÂ this was locker room talk. IÃ¢ÂÂm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly IÃ¢ÂÂm not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.

You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have Ã¢ÂÂ and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.

And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on.

Yes, IÃ¢ÂÂm very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But itÃ¢ÂÂs locker room talk, and itÃ¢ÂÂs one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.

COOPER: So, Mr. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.

COOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?

TRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.

COOPER: So, for the record, youÃ¢ÂÂre saying you never did that?

TRUMP: IÃ¢ÂÂve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.

COOPER: Have you ever done those things?

TRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that IÃ¢ÂÂm going to make our country safe. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to have borders in our country, which we donÃ¢ÂÂt have now. People are pouring into our country, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre coming in from the Middle East and other places.

WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to make America safe again. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to make America great again, but weÃ¢ÂÂre going to make America safe again. And weÃ¢ÂÂre going to make America wealthy again, because if you donÃ¢ÂÂt do that, it just Ã¢ÂÂ it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.

COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

TRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and theyÃ¢ÂÂre taking our wealth.

COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

TRUMP: And thatÃ¢ÂÂs what I want to talk about.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?

CLINTON: Well, like everyone else, IÃ¢ÂÂve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.

Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesnÃ¢ÂÂt represent who he is.

But I think itÃ¢ÂÂs clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because weÃ¢ÂÂve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. WeÃ¢ÂÂve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. WeÃ¢ÂÂve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.

So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But itÃ¢ÂÂs not only women, and itÃ¢ÂÂs not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.

So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why Ã¢ÂÂ to go back to your question Ã¢ÂÂ I want to send a message Ã¢ÂÂ we all should Ã¢ÂÂ to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.

CLINTON: These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if IÃ¢ÂÂm so fortunate enough to become your president.

RADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from onlineÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.

RADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that.

TRUMP: ItÃ¢ÂÂs just words, folks. ItÃ¢ÂÂs just words. Those words, IÃ¢ÂÂve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.

IÃ¢ÂÂve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. IÃ¢ÂÂm going to help the African-Americans. IÃ¢ÂÂm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.

SheÃ¢ÂÂs done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaignÃ¢ÂÂ¦

RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump Ã¢ÂÂ I want to get to audience questions and online questions.

TRUMP: So, sheÃ¢ÂÂs allowed to do that, but IÃ¢ÂÂm not allowed to respond?

RADDATZ: YouÃ¢ÂÂre going to have Ã¢ÂÂ youÃ¢ÂÂre going to get to respond right now.

TRUMP: Sounds fair.

RADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, itÃ¢ÂÂs become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, Ã¢ÂÂTrump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?Ã¢ÂÂ So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.

TRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. IÃ¢ÂÂm not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, IÃ¢ÂÂm not proud of it. But that was something that happened.

If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what heÃ¢ÂÂs done to women. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs never been anybody in the history politics in this nation thatÃ¢ÂÂs been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.

Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and sheÃ¢ÂÂs seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.

So donÃ¢ÂÂt tell me about words. I am absolutely Ã¢ÂÂ I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, whoÃ¢ÂÂs also here tonight.

And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think itÃ¢ÂÂs disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.

(APPLAUSE)

RADDATZ: Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.

CLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what heÃ¢ÂÂs just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering peopleÃ¢ÂÂs questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, thatÃ¢ÂÂs his choice.

When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.

(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what heÃ¢ÂÂs saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.

CLINTON: He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.

He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldnÃ¢ÂÂt be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, Ã¢ÂÂMexican.Ã¢ÂÂ

He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.

TRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal Ã¢ÂÂ heÃ¢ÂÂs another real winner that you have Ã¢ÂÂ and heÃ¢ÂÂs the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. YouÃ¢ÂÂre the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.

Number two, Michelle Obama. IÃ¢ÂÂve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And IÃ¢ÂÂve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials IÃ¢ÂÂve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.

So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.

But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.

And IÃ¢ÂÂll tell you what. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt think IÃ¢ÂÂd say this, but IÃ¢ÂÂm going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have a special prosecutor.

When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails Ã¢ÂÂ and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.

So weÃ¢ÂÂre going to get a special prosecutor, and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to look into it, because you know what? People have been Ã¢ÂÂ their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what youÃ¢ÂÂve done. And itÃ¢ÂÂs a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: IÃ¢ÂÂm going to let you talk about e-mails.

CLINTON: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ because everything he just said is absolutely false, but IÃ¢ÂÂm not surprised.

TRUMP: Oh, really?

CLINTON: In the first debateÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(LAUGHTER)

RADDATZ: And really, the audience needs to calm down here.

CLINTON: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. IÃ¢ÂÂd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how weÃ¢ÂÂre going to really make lives better for people.

So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump Ã¢ÂÂ you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect weÃ¢ÂÂll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.

TRUMP: Because youÃ¢ÂÂd be in jail.

(APPLAUSE)

RADDATZ: Secretary ClintonÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. YouÃ¢ÂÂre just wasting time.

RADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. YouÃ¢ÂÂve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, Ã¢ÂÂextremely careless.Ã¢ÂÂ The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You donÃ¢ÂÂt call that extremely careless? CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say Ã¢ÂÂ and IÃ¢ÂÂve said before, but IÃ¢ÂÂll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it Ã¢ÂÂ that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. IÃ¢ÂÂm not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that.

But I think itÃ¢ÂÂs also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all Ã¢ÂÂ anyone who says otherwise has no basis Ã¢ÂÂ that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.

I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.

RADDATZ: OK, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to move on.

TRUMP: And yet she didnÃ¢ÂÂt know the word Ã¢ÂÂ the letter C on a document. Right? She didnÃ¢ÂÂt even know what that word Ã¢ÂÂ what that letter meant.

You know, itÃ¢ÂÂs amazing. IÃ¢ÂÂm watching Hillary go over facts. And sheÃ¢ÂÂs going after fact after fact, and sheÃ¢ÂÂs lying again, because she said she Ã¢ÂÂ you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I donÃ¢ÂÂt think so.

She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughterÃ¢ÂÂs wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe weÃ¢ÂÂll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now sheÃ¢ÂÂs saying there wasnÃ¢ÂÂt anything wrong.

And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasnÃ¢ÂÂt before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And IÃ¢ÂÂll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.

Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did Ã¢ÂÂ and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.

COOPER: We have to move on.

TRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.

RADDATZ: We want to give the audience a chance.

TRUMP: If you did that in the private sector, youÃ¢ÂÂd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question.

CLINTON: Look, itÃ¢ÂÂs just not true. And so please, go toÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: Oh, you didnÃ¢ÂÂt delete them?

COOPER: Allow her to respond, please.

CLINTON: It was personal e-mails, not official.

TRUMP: Oh, 33,000? Yeah.

CLINTON: Not Ã¢ÂÂ well, we turned over 35,000, soÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?

COOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didnÃ¢ÂÂt talk while you talked.

CLINTON: Yes, thatÃ¢ÂÂs true, I didnÃ¢ÂÂt.

TRUMP: Because you have nothing to say.

CLINTON: I didnÃ¢ÂÂt in the first debate, and IÃ¢ÂÂm going to try not to in this debate, because IÃ¢ÂÂd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.

TRUMP: Get off this question.

CLINTON: OK, Donald. I know youÃ¢ÂÂre into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way itÃ¢ÂÂs exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But letÃ¢ÂÂs at least focusÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: LetÃ¢ÂÂs see what happensÃ¢ÂÂ¦

(CROSSTALK)

COOPER: Allow her to respond.

CLINTON: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ on some of the issues that people care about tonight. LetÃ¢ÂÂs get to their questions.

COOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?

TRUMP: IÃ¢ÂÂd like to know, Anderson, why arenÃ¢ÂÂt you bringing up the e-mails? IÃ¢ÂÂd like to know. Why arenÃ¢ÂÂt you bringingÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: We brought up the e-mails.

TRUMP: No, it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt. It hasnÃ¢ÂÂt. And it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been finished at all.

COOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question.

TRUMP: ItÃ¢ÂÂs nice to Ã¢ÂÂ one on three.

QUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?

COOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.

CLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald.

TRUMP: No, IÃ¢ÂÂm a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.

(LAUGHTER)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say heÃ¢ÂÂs going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And IÃ¢ÂÂm going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and IÃ¢ÂÂve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.

But hereÃ¢ÂÂs what I donÃ¢ÂÂt want people to forget when weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt just that 20 million got insurance who didnÃ¢ÂÂt have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.

But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies canÃ¢ÂÂt deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.

Number three, women canÃ¢ÂÂt be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if youÃ¢ÂÂre under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didnÃ¢ÂÂt happen before.

So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But weÃ¢ÂÂve got to get costs down. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again.

Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the highest weÃ¢ÂÂve ever been in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up.

CLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.

COOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.

TRUMP: It is such a great question and itÃ¢ÂÂs maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. ItÃ¢ÂÂs going up at numbers that nobodyÃ¢ÂÂs ever seen worldwide. NobodyÃ¢ÂÂs ever seen numbers like this for health care.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs only getting worse. In Ã¢ÂÂ17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.

Obamacare will never work. ItÃ¢ÂÂs very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. ItÃ¢ÂÂs going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.

We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want Ã¢ÂÂ and President Obama and whoever was working on it Ã¢ÂÂ they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.

You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you havenÃ¢ÂÂt noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. ItÃ¢ÂÂs catastrophic in certain ways.

But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobodyÃ¢ÂÂs ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, youÃ¢ÂÂre never going to be able to use it.

COOPER: Mr. Trump, your timeÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, Ã¢ÂÂthe craziest thing in the world,Ã¢ÂÂ saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?

CLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And itÃ¢ÂÂs very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs where the vast majority of people get their health care.

And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldnÃ¢ÂÂt put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didnÃ¢ÂÂt have the money to afford insurance and didnÃ¢ÂÂt have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.

That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what DonaldÃ¢ÂÂs not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companiesÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: Secretary ClintonÃ¢ÂÂ¦

CLINTON: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry, youÃ¢ÂÂve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthmaÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: Your time is up.

CLINTON: Ã¢ÂÂ¦ you may not be able to have insurance because you canÃ¢ÂÂt afford it. So letÃ¢ÂÂs fix whatÃ¢ÂÂs broken about it, but letÃ¢ÂÂs not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not going to work.

COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. TRUMP: Well, I just want Ã¢ÂÂ just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everythingÃ¢ÂÂs broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.

COOPER: YouÃ¢ÂÂve said you want to end ObamacareÃ¢ÂÂ¦

TRUMP: By the wayÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: YouÃ¢ÂÂve said you want to end Obamacare. YouÃ¢ÂÂve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if youÃ¢ÂÂre no longer mandating that every American get insurance?

TRUMP: WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to be able to. YouÃ¢ÂÂre going to have plansÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: What does that mean?

TRUMP: Well, IÃ¢ÂÂll tell you what it means. YouÃ¢ÂÂre going to have plans that are so good, because weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out Ã¢ÂÂ once we break out the lines and allow the competition to comeÃ¢ÂÂ¦

COOPER: Are you going Ã¢ÂÂ are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?

TRUMP: President Obama Ã¢ÂÂ Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said Ã¢ÂÂ he said it was a great lie, i"	0

393	"On his Aug. 30 radio program, conservative commentator Sean Hannity noted that Texas Gov. Rick PerryÃ¢ÂÂs years-ago switch from the Democratic to the Republican party Puts him in the same company as the nationÃ¢ÂÂs 40th president.

""YouÃ¢ÂÂre sort of like Ronald Reagan, you feel the Democratic Party left you?"" Hannity asked.

Perry replied that heÃ¢ÂÂd had a conversation with ReaganÃ¢ÂÂs son Michael, a political consultant and former radio host. ""I told Michael Reagan the other day Ã¢ÂÂ¦ Ã¢ÂÂYou know, I love your dad, and he was part of the reason I became a Republican,Ã¢ÂÂ but I said, Ã¢ÂÂI became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.Ã¢ÂÂ ""

Perry and Hannity shared a laugh over that. But that light moment left unresolved how old each leader was when he made his D-to-R leap. Did Perry beat Reagan to the flip point?

WeÃ¢ÂÂll take a look at Reagan first. In March 2010, PolitiFact Florida rated True the claim that ""Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican.""

Historian Edward Yager, author of the 2006 biography Ronald ReaganÃ¢ÂÂs Journey: Democrat to Republican, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, ""was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21.""

Yager said that he hadnÃ¢ÂÂt seen copies of ReaganÃ¢ÂÂs voter registration cards but that ""virtually all the sources that refer to"" ReaganÃ¢ÂÂs party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat. Yager also noted that Reagan ""has two autobiographies in which he refers to his voting for (Roosevelt) four times"" and then for President Harry Truman, a Democrat, in 1948.

Later, while still a Democrat, Reagan began supporting Republican presidential candidates. Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at ReaganÃ¢ÂÂs presidential library, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan endorsed the presidential candidacies of Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 Ã¢ÂÂ at ages 41 and 45, respectively Ã¢ÂÂ and Republican Richard Nixon in 1960 ""while remaining a Democrat.""

Perry and other Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to debate at the Reagan library, in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 7.

The libraryÃ¢ÂÂs website says Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51. According to the site, a woman interrupted Reagan while he was speaking in favor of NixonÃ¢ÂÂs unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in California to ask him whether he had yet to register as a Republican. ""When he said, Ã¢ÂÂWell, no, I havenÃ¢ÂÂt yet, but I intend to,Ã¢ÂÂ down the center aisle through the audience came a woman who declared, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm a registrar,Ã¢ÂÂ and placed a registration card in front of him,"" the site says. ""In front of his audience, Ronald Reagan officially joined the Republican Party.""

In her 2010 email to PolitiFact Florida, Giller pointed to the famous Reagan quip that Hannity echoed on his show: ""I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.''

Other studies of Reagan also trace his party switch to 1962, including YagerÃ¢ÂÂs book and a 1982 Reagan biography by Lou Cannon, which says Reagan ""was an active Democrat"" in 1952, when he married Nancy Davis, ""and would remain a registered Democrat for another decade.""

In 1962, Cannon writes, when Reagan was approached by California Republicans to help campaign on their behalf, he told them that he ""didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to be a professional Democrat campaigning for the Republicans"" and would re-register as a Republican. ""He did so, at a subsequent political meeting where he spoke on behalf of the ill-fated Nixon campaign against Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown,"" Cannon writes.

So, by several accounts, Reagan was 51 when he became a Republican, although he began backing GOP presidential candidates a decade earlier.

How old was Perry, born March 4, 1950, when he made his move?

WeÃ¢ÂÂve looked at PerryÃ¢ÂÂs political past in previous fact-checks, reporting that Perry won his first election as a Democrat, taking a West Texas House district seat in 1984, when Democrats controlled the Legislature and the state had had just one Republican governor since Reconstruction. He won re-election in 1986 and 1988 before switching parties in 1989 to challenge Democratic Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower in 1990 Ã¢ÂÂ a race that Perry won in an upset.

The biography on PerryÃ¢ÂÂs presidential campaign website agrees with that account.

A July 14 Texas Tribune story says that during his years in the Texas House, Perry was far from liberal. ""Perry, a young rancher and cotton farmer, gained an early reputation as a fiscal conservative,"" the story says. ""He was one of a handful of freshman Ã¢ÂÂpit bulls,Ã¢ÂÂ so named because they sat in the lower pit of the House Appropriations Committee, where they fought to keep spending low.""

The Tribune story says Perry announced he was changing parties on Sept. 29, 1989, during a press conference outside the Texas Capitol. ""I intend to vote the same convictions,"" Perry said then, according to the Tribune. ""The only difference is there will be an Ã¢ÂÂRÃ¢ÂÂ beside my name.""

On the day of the press conference, Perry was 39 years old.

We rate his statement as True."	0
394	"With the fire of a Baptist preacher, GeorgiaÃ¢ÂÂs newest presidential prospect warned a crowd of thousands that the country has gone astray under President Barack Obama.



""We have become a nation of crises,"" Republican Herman Cain shouted during his Saturday announcement at Centennial Olympic Park that heÃ¢ÂÂs running for president.



""Look at the facts. DonÃ¢ÂÂt listen to the rhetoric,"" he said. High gas prices. A rising national debt. High unemployment.



""Forty-seven million people on food stamps,"" Cain said. ""ThatÃ¢ÂÂs 14 million more than when the current occupant of the White House took over.""



Food stamps? your PolitiFact Georgia scribes wondered. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs with Georgia Republicans and food stamps lately?



Last week, the stateÃ¢ÂÂs other presidential contender, Newt Gingrich, said Obama deserves to be called ""the most successful food stamp president in American history"" because ""47 million Americans are on food stamps.""



We ruled GingrichÃ¢ÂÂs statement Half True. For the most part, Gingrich got his facts straight but oversimplified who was to blame.



Cain, a former radio talk show host and GodfatherÃ¢ÂÂs Pizza CEO, urged the crowd at his rally to ""look at the facts."" PolitiFact Georgia is all to happy to oblige him.



Food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, give certain low-income Americans vouchers to buy groceries.



The most recent data show roughly 44.2 million people received SNAP benefits in February, the most recent data available.



CainÃ¢ÂÂs numbers arenÃ¢ÂÂt quite accurate, but heÃ¢ÂÂs close. The number of recipients has topped 44 million since December, which means his estimate is about 7 percent too high.



The number of beneficiaries has climbed every single month since Obama took office, despite signs of an improving economy. According to historical data, FebruaryÃ¢ÂÂs count appears to be the highest in any month since the program was established in 1969.



Obama took office in January 2009. That month, nearly 32 million people received SNAP benefits. That means the number of food stamp recipients has increased by about 12.2 million since the start of his administration.



Cain placed the increase at 14 million, which is about 15 percent too high. Again, heÃ¢ÂÂs close, but not quite right.



Whether Obama deserves the blame for the increase is far less clear.



The rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the Great Recession, which started more than a year before Obama took office. Conservatives and liberals agree that Obama inherited a troubled economy. Whether SNAP usage would have been lower if Republicans won the presidency is impossible to tell.



The number of food stamp beneficiaries ticked upward under President George W. Bush because of policies that broadened eligibility for the program and more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits. These policies remained in place under Obama.



Another reason assigning blame is tough is that there is typically a lag between when the broader economy begins to recover and when SNAP usage declines. The monthly growth has slowed for the past three months, and it could start declining in a month or two.



CainÃ¢ÂÂs accusation against Obama was not as barbed as GingrichÃ¢ÂÂs, but he did lay the blame for food stamp usage at the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs feet. We therefore give the presidential candidate a Mostly True."	0
395	"Obama Urges Bernanke, Paulson to Fight Foreclosures, Hold Homeownership Summit

Thursday, March 22, 2007

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Contact: Ben LaBolt

WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama today sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Paulson urging them to immediately convene a homeownership preservation summit with key stakeholders to fight foreclosures driven by growth in the subprime mortgage market.

The text of the letter is below:

Dear Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Paulson,

There is grave concern in low-income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures. Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market, I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders, investors, loan servicing organizations, consumer advocates, federal regulators and housing-related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge.

We cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes. And while neither the government nor the private sector acting alone is capable of quickly balancing the important interests in widespread access to credit and responsible lending, both must act and act quickly.

Working together, the relevant private sector entities and regulators may be best positioned for quick and targeted responses to mitigate the danger. Rampant foreclosures are in nobodyÃ¢ÂÂs interest, and I believe this is a case where all responsible industry players can share the objective of eliminating deceptive or abusive practices, preserving homeownership, and stabilizing housing markets.

The summit should consider best practice loan marketing, underwriting, and origination practices consistent with the recent (and overdue) regulatorsÃ¢ÂÂ Proposed Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending. The summit participants should also evaluate options for independent loan counseling, voluntary loan restructuring, limited forbearance, and other possible workout strategies. I would also urge you to facilitate a serious conversation about the following:

What standards investors should require of lenders, particularly with regard to verification of income and assets and the underwriting of borrowers based on fully indexed and fully amortized rates.

How to facilitate and encourage appropriate intervention by loan servicing companies at the earliest signs of borrower difficulty.

How to support independent community-based-organizations to provide counseling and work-out services to prevent foreclosure and preserve homeownership where practical.

How to provide more effective information disclosure and financial education to ensure that borrowers are treated fairly and that deception is never a source of competitive advantage.

How to adopt principles of fair competition that promote affordability, transparency, non-discrimination, genuine consumer value, and competitive returns.

How to ensure adequate liquidity across all mortgage markets without exacerbating consumer and housing market vulnerability.

Of course, the adoption of voluntary industry reforms will not preempt government action to crack down on predatory lending practices, or to style new restrictions on subprime lending or short-term post-purchase interventions in certain cases. My colleagues on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs have held important hearings on mortgage market turmoil and I expect the Committee will develop legislation.

Nevertheless, a consortium of industry-related service providers and public interest advocates may be able to bring quick and efficient relief to millions of at-risk homeowners and neighborhoods, even before Congress has had an opportunity to act. There is an opportunity here to bring different interests together in the best interests of American homeowners and the American economy. Please donÃ¢ÂÂt let this opportunity pass us by.

Sincerely,

U.S. Senator Barack Obama"	0
396	"Russian President Vladimir Putin's approval rating has reached nearly 90 percent largely thanks to his military moves in Syria, according to a new nationwide poll published Thursday.

State-run pollster VTsIOM said a record 89.9 percent of Russians approved of Putin in its latest weekly survey Ã¢ÂÂ up from 86.6 percent a week earlier and above the previous record of 89.1 in June 2015.

""Such high approval rating of the president of Russia had to do mostly with the events in Syria, [and] Russian airstrikes on terrorist positions,"" VTsIOM said on its website.

Moscow claims the air operation in Syria is aimed at weakening ISIS. Western officials have questioned whether Russia is actually targeting moderate rebels in a move to bolster its flagging ally, Syrian President Bashar Assad.

PutinÃ¢ÂÂs rating had been hovering above 80 percent since spring 2014, when Russia annexed UkraineÃ¢ÂÂs Crimea peninsula and endorsed a bloody pro-Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine.

With the latest VTsIOM poll, Putin's popularity is now just a notch below that of Central Asian dictators Ã¢ÂÂ who can often rack up between 90 and 97 percent of votes in elections.

While VTsIOM is a respected pollster, analysts have long questioned Russian approval polls. Studies show that in authoritarian states, polls can overstate the popularity of incumbent leaders by between 5 and 20 percent because many respondents give the answers that they think are expected of them.

The latest figures come amid a prolonged economic slump. Official data released earlier this week shows Russian household income has been decreasing for the past 11 months.

Almost half of respondents in last monthÃ¢ÂÂs VTsIOM poll last month said they expected the economic crisis to get worse.

VTsIOM said it polled 1,600 people and that the poll's margin of error was 3.5 percentage points."	0

398	"Convicted church shooter Dylann Roof has been transferred to death row at Terre Haute Federal Prison in Indiana Ã¢ÂÂ the facility that houses male inmates awaiting execution under the federal government.

Roof, the first person to be convicted of a federal hate crime and sentenced to the death penalty, was removed from custody in Al Cannon Detention Center in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Friday and transferred to Terre Haute, prison records show.

Terre Haute, a medium-security prison where inmates are put to death by lethal injection, currently houses 1,338 inmates.

In January, a jury sentenced the self-proclaimed white supremacist to death for killing nine black worshipers in June 2015 at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston during a Bible study. The 23-year-old told FBI agents that he was trying to start a race war.

He also pleaded guilty to nine counts of state murder charges on April 10.

Roof is now among the long list of well-known criminals who have spent time in the Indiana facility. Others include murderer and drug trafficker Raul Garza and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.

Read more about the lethal injection controversy here

As of Feb. 9, there were 62 federal inmates on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Three inmates have been on death row since 1993 Ã¢ÂÂ drug gang members Richard Tipton, James Roane Jr. and Corey Johnson, who were convicted of killing nine people to protect their crack trade.

Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who a jury in 2015 recommended be put to death, remains in a federal lockup in Colorado, where officials say they can better handle his ""unique"" security arrangements.

After the federal death penalty was suspended by a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision, it was brought back 16 years later and three people have since been executed under it.

Like his fellow death row inmates, it isn't likely Roof will be executed anytime soon.

Legal battles are underway in a number of states, including Arkansas and Ohio, over the constitutionality of controversial lethal injection methods. Prosecutors and defense lawyers are arguing over whether one of the three drugs used in the process, called midazolam, constitutes ""cruel and unusual punishment"" because it fails to render inmates unconscious before two other drugs are injected."	1

402	What we are witnessing is truly frightening. In my entire lifetime, I have never seen as much hate as I have over the past few weeks. It is almost as if a very large chunk of the global population has suddenly gone mad. But of course all of this hate did not come out of a vacuum. It has been simmering for many years, and now the war in the Middle East has brought it to the surface. Humans were created to love and to be loved, and so if you find yourself consumed with hatred you are part of the problem. Of course we knew that this global explosion of hate would be coming. The Bible warns us repeatedly about what the condition of humanity will be like in the end times. One example of this can be found in Matthew chapter 24Ã¢ÂÂ¦ (Read More...)	1
403	"Rose Garden

11:00 A.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Everybody, please have a seat. Sorry weÃ¢ÂÂre running just a little bit behind, but I figured itÃ¢ÂÂs a great day to enjoy the Rose Garden.

Today, members of Congress have a simple choice to make: They can stand with the big oil companies, or they can stand with the American people.

Right now, the biggest oil companies are raking in record profits Ã¢ÂÂ- profits that go up every time folks pull up into a gas station. But on top of these record profits, oil companies are also getting billions a year -- billions a year in taxpayer subsidies -Ã¢ÂÂ a subsidy that theyÃ¢ÂÂve enjoyed year after year for the last century.

Think about that. ItÃ¢ÂÂs like hitting the American people twice. YouÃ¢ÂÂre already paying a premium at the pump right now. And on top of that, Congress, up until this point, has thought it was a good idea to send billions of dollars more in tax dollars to the oil industry.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs not as if these companies canÃ¢ÂÂt stand on their own. Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits. Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour. And when the price of oil goes up, prices at the pump go up, and so do these companiesÃ¢ÂÂ profits. In fact, one analysis shows that every time gas goes up by a penny, these companies usually pocket another $200 million in quarterly profits. Meanwhile, these companies pay a lower tax rate than most other companies on their investments, partly because weÃ¢ÂÂre giving them billions in tax giveaways every year.

Now, I want to make clear, we all know that drilling for oil has to be a key part of our overall energy strategy. We want U.S. oil companies to be doing well. We want them to succeed. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why under my administration, weÃ¢ÂÂve opened up millions of acres of federal lands and waters to oil and gas production. WeÃ¢ÂÂve quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high. WeÃ¢ÂÂve added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some. And just yesterday, we announced the next step for potential new oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic.

So the fact is, weÃ¢ÂÂre producing more oil right now than we have in eight years, and weÃ¢ÂÂre importing less of it as well. For two years in a row, America has bought less oil from other countries than we produce here at home -Ã¢ÂÂ for the first time in over a decade.

So American oil is booming. The oil industry is doing just fine. With record profits and rising production, IÃ¢ÂÂm not worried about the big oil companies. With high oil prices around the world, theyÃ¢ÂÂve got more than enough incentive to produce even more oil. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why I think itÃ¢ÂÂs time they got by without more help from taxpayers who are already having a tough enough time paying the bills and filling up their gas tank. And I think itÃ¢ÂÂs curious that some folks in Congress, who are the first to belittle investments in new sources of energy, are the ones that are fighting the hardest to maintain these giveaways for the oil companies.

Instead of taxpayer giveaways to an industry thatÃ¢ÂÂs never been more profitable, we should be using that money to double-down on investments in clean energy technologies that have never been more promising -- investments in wind power and solar power and biofuels; investments in fuel-efficient cars and trucks, and energy-efficient homes and buildings. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the future. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the only way we're going to break this cycle of high gas prices that happen year after year after year. As the economy is growing, the only time you start seeing lower gas prices is when the economy is doing badly. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not the kind of pattern that we want to be in. We want the economy doing well, and people to be able to afford their energy costs.

And keep in mind, we canÃ¢ÂÂt just drill our way out of this problem. As I said, oil production here in the United States is doing very well, and it's been doing well even as gas prices are going up. Well, the reason is because we use more than 20 percent of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs oil but we only have 2 percent of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs known oil reserves. And that means we could drill every drop of American oil tomorrow but weÃ¢ÂÂd still have to buy oil from other countries to make up the difference. WeÃ¢ÂÂd still have to depend on other countries to meet our energy needs. And because itÃ¢ÂÂs a world market, the fact that weÃ¢ÂÂre doing more here in the United States doesnÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily help us because even U.S. oil companies theyÃ¢ÂÂre selling that oil on a worldwide market. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre not keeping it just for us. And that means that if thereÃ¢ÂÂs rising demand around the world then the prices are going to up.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not the future that I want for America. I donÃ¢ÂÂt want folks like these back here and the folks in front of me to have to pay more at the pump every time that thereÃ¢ÂÂs some unrest in the Middle East and oil speculators get nervous about whether thereÃ¢ÂÂs going to be enough supply. I donÃ¢ÂÂt want our kids to be held hostage to events on the other side of the world.

I want us to control our own destiny. I want us to forge our own future. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why, as long as IÃ¢ÂÂm President, America is going to pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which means we will continue developing our oil and gas resources in a robust and responsible way. But it also means that weÃ¢ÂÂre going to keep developing more advanced homegrown biofuels, the kinds that are already powering truck fleets across America.

WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to keep investing in clean energy like the wind power and solar power thatÃ¢ÂÂs already lighting thousands of homes and creating thousands of jobs. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to keep manufacturing more cars and trucks to get more miles to the gallon so that you can fill up once every two weeks instead of every week. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to keep building more homes and businesses that waste less energy so that youÃ¢ÂÂre in charge of your own energy bills.

WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to do all of this by harnessing our most inexhaustible resource: American ingenuity and American imagination. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need to keep going. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs whatÃ¢ÂÂs at stake right now. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the choice that we face. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs the choice thatÃ¢ÂÂs facing Congress today. They can either vote to spend billions of dollars more in oil subsidies that keep us trapped in the past, or they can vote to end these taxpayer subsidies that arenÃ¢ÂÂt needed to boost oil production so that we can invest in the future. ItÃ¢ÂÂs that simple.

And as long as IÃ¢ÂÂm President, IÃ¢ÂÂm betting on the future. And as the people IÃ¢ÂÂve talked to around the country, including the people who are behind me here today, they put their faith in the future as well. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we do as Americans. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs who we are. We innovate. We discover. We seek new solutions to some of our biggest challenges. And, ultimately, because we stick with it, we succeed. And I believe that weÃ¢ÂÂre going to do that again. Today, the American people are going to be watching Congress to see if they have that same faith.

Thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.)

404	"An Ohio high school student said he tried to stay apolitical during the National Walkout Day over gun violence but was suspended for his choice to remain in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, going to study hall.

Jacob Shoemaker, a senior at Hilliard Davidson High School, said he didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to take sides in the gun-control debate consuming the country. If he went outside for the walkout, he said, he would be supporting gun control. If he stayed in the common area of the school, he said, he would be seen as supporting gun violence and disrespecting the 17 lives lost in the Parkland, Fla. High school shooting the month before.

Jacob had met with the schoolÃ¢ÂÂs principal on Tuesday, a day before the rally, for about an hour to find out what exactly the walkout was supporting. But he said the principal reportedly told him it was for the Ã¢ÂÂstudents to express themselves.Ã¢ÂÂ

COLLEGE STUDENT KICKED OUT OF CLASS FOR TELLING PROFESSOR THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS

This left Jacob wondering if it was a memorial for the lives lost or a show of support for gun control.

He decided, instead, to stay in class for about 20 minutes doing homework after his teacher and fellow classmates left and locked the door.

When they returned, he was slapped with a suspension.

JacobÃ¢ÂÂs father, Scott Shoemaker, said his son was just trying to stay neutral Ã¢ÂÂ and did nothing wrong.

Ã¢ÂÂPolitics [doesnÃ¢ÂÂt] belong in the school,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂStudents shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be pressured into taking a side.Ã¢ÂÂ

STUDENT WITH Ã¢ÂÂTRUMPÃ¢ÂÂ FLAG ASSAULTED BY MOB DURING NATIONAL SCHOOL WALKOUT

The story went viral after Jacob sent a photo of his out-of-school suspension citation to one of his friends, who posted it on social media.

The school, as well as the Shoemakers, have received death threats and hate messages.

Scott Shoemaker said his son was just trying to be introspective Ã¢ÂÂ and he wasnÃ¢ÂÂt acting out.

Ã¢ÂÂHe didnÃ¢ÂÂt do anything to deserve this,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂHe didnÃ¢ÂÂt ask for this.Ã¢ÂÂ

406	"Debt Day: A Symbol of WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂs Arrogant Culture of Borrowing and Spending (Boehner Op-Ed on Townhall.com)

Washington, Apr 22 - Next week, the Obama Administration will mark its 100th day in power. The first three-plus months of this Administration have been turbulent, to say the least. Confronted with the most severe economic crisis in generations, President Obama and congressional Democrats have set out on a spending spree the likes of which our nation has never seen. In fact, the Administration has spent more in its first 100 days than all previous presidents have combined Ã¢ÂÂ hardly a distinction of which to be proud.



Feeling the heat, the President has asked his Cabinet to begin identifying wasteful programs to cut from the federal budget. While this sort of talk sounds good, the inescapable fact is that the Administration and Congress have spent the last three months piling mountains of wasteful debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren. Just take a look at how some of the so-called Ã¢ÂÂstimulusÃ¢ÂÂ dollars are being spent. In spite of promises of transparency and accountability from the Administration, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars are being spent on wasteful projects: a skateboard park in Rhode Island, bike racks in the District of Columbia, highway studies instead of construction projects in my native Ohio, and programs led by housing agencies that have repeatedly failed audits Ã¢ÂÂ all in the name of economic Ã¢ÂÂstimulus.Ã¢ÂÂ

This Sunday marks a day that is symbolic not only of our governmentÃ¢ÂÂs arrogant culture of spending Ã¢ÂÂ but of this AdministrationÃ¢ÂÂs borrowing binge as well. ItÃ¢ÂÂs called Ã¢ÂÂDebt Day.Ã¢ÂÂ Many workers have become familiar with a concept known as Ã¢ÂÂTax Freedom Day,Ã¢ÂÂ which is the day on which Americans begin working for themselves each year, after having covered Uncle SamÃ¢ÂÂs tax bill for the year. Debt Day is very similar. It is the day of the Fiscal Year Ã¢ÂÂ beginning on October 1 of the previous calendar year Ã¢ÂÂ on which total government spending exceeds total federal revenues. And in our current Fiscal Year, that falls on April 26 Ã¢ÂÂ this Sunday, just days before the AdministrationÃ¢ÂÂs 100th day milestone. In short, about halfway through Fiscal Year 2009, Washington has run out of money.

I often like to highlight the folly of politicians spending money we donÃ¢ÂÂt have. Well, Debt Day illustrates exactly what IÃ¢ÂÂm talking about. Starting this Sunday, every day between now and September 30, 2009, when the federal governmentÃ¢ÂÂs budget year ends, weÃ¢ÂÂll be deficit spending and piling more massive debt onto the backs of our children and grandchildren.

Think about it from your familyÃ¢ÂÂs perspective. If your entire income for the year was paid out in the first six months of the year, would you spend it all during that first half of the year and charge the rest of the yearÃ¢ÂÂs spending on a credit card Ã¢ÂÂ plunging your family deeper and deeper into debt? Almost certainly not. A responsible family would show some discipline by drawing up and following a budget so its annual spending was spread out throughout the entire year.

This is a concept House Republicans had in mind when we offered a better solution during the budget debate several weeks ago. Our plan would curb spending, create jobs by cutting taxes, and control the debt Ã¢ÂÂ all with an eye toward restoring some fiscal sanity on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. But the Democrats in charge of our government would have none of it.

WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂs attitude gives new meaning to the common sales phrase Ã¢ÂÂbuy now, pay later.Ã¢ÂÂ Congress and the White House have burned through our governmentÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂincomeÃ¢ÂÂ for the current Fiscal Year Ã¢ÂÂ a practice that shows no signs of stopping after Debt Day comes and goes on Sunday. So, Washington will continue to Ã¢ÂÂbuy now,Ã¢ÂÂ while taxpayers 10, 20, and 30 years from now will be forced to Ã¢ÂÂpay later.Ã¢ÂÂ And pay dearly, they will."	0

408	"Across the United States, billions of dollars are spent each year on lottery tickets. For many people, these tickets are a part of their daily lives and a source of fun, but for others they represent an all-out attempt to win big. It is a gamble that can lead to financial ruin and even mental illness. And while it is legal, itÃ¢ÂÂs not something you should take lightly.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to find anyone who doesnÃ¢ÂÂt know that the lottery is a gambling game in which players pay a small amount of money for a chance to win a larger sum of money. But what most people donÃ¢ÂÂt realize is that lotteries arenÃ¢ÂÂt just about winning the jackpot; they also encourage reckless spending and can have a detrimental effect on society.

The history of lotteries goes back centuries. Moses was instructed by the Lord to use a lottery to divide land among the Israelites, and Roman emperors used it as an entertainment at Saturnalian feasts. The practice eventually spread to America, where it was adopted by New Hampshire in 1964, followed by 13 other states.

When state governments decide to adopt a lottery, they often argue that the proceeds will benefit some specific public good, such as education. This argument is effective at gaining and maintaining popular support, especially during times of economic stress. But studies have shown that lottery popularity has little correlation with the actual fiscal health of a state.

Once a lottery is established, it inevitably expands in size and complexity. It is a classic example of public policy made piecemeal and incrementally, with authority divided among multiple agencies and with the general welfare only intermittently taken into account. The growth of lottery games is usually driven by market forces, and the number of available games often exceeds the number of people who can afford to play them.

While rich people do buy lottery tickets (one of the largest jackpots was won by three asset managers from Greenwich, Connecticut), they purchase far fewer than the poor do. The result is that the lottery is a regressive enterprise. On average, those making more than fifty thousand dollars spend one percent of their income on tickets; those making less than thirty-seven thousand spend thirteen percent.

As a business, a lottery is all about maximizing revenues. That means that advertising necessarily focuses on persuading people to spend their money on tickets, and the tactics are not that dissimilar to those used by tobacco companies and video-game producers. But should a government be in the business of promoting gambling? And if it is, is the lottery at cross-purposes with the larger public interest?"	1

412	"DONALD TRUMP, the President of the United States, along with Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, and Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, sat down for a conversation with editors from The Economist on May 4th, 2017. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.

The Economist: Could we start with the economy?

Donald Trump: Sure.

What is Trumponomics and how does it differ from standard Republican economics?

Well itÃ¢ÂÂs an interesting question. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think itÃ¢ÂÂs ever been asked quite that way. But it really has to do with self-respect as a nation. It has to do with trade deals that have to be fair, and somewhat reciprocal, if not fully reciprocal. And I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a word that youÃ¢ÂÂre going to see a lot of, because we need reciprocality in terms of our trade deals. We have nations whereÃ¢ÂÂ¦theyÃ¢ÂÂll get as much as 100% of a tax or a tariff for a certain product and for the same product we get nothing, OK? ItÃ¢ÂÂs very unfair. And the very interesting thing about that is that, if I said IÃ¢ÂÂm going to put a tax on of 10%, the free-traders, somewhat foolishly, theyÃ¢ÂÂll say Ã¢ÂÂOh, heÃ¢ÂÂs not a free-traderÃ¢ÂÂ, which I am, IÃ¢ÂÂm absolutely a free-trader. IÃ¢ÂÂm for open trade, free trade, but I also want smart trade and fair trade. But theyÃ¢ÂÂll say, Ã¢ÂÂHeÃ¢ÂÂs not a free-trader,Ã¢ÂÂ at 10%. But if I say weÃ¢ÂÂre putting a reciprocal tax on, it may be 62% or it may be 47%, I mean massive numbers, and nobody can complain about it. ItÃ¢ÂÂs really sort of an amazing thing.

So thatÃ¢ÂÂs the story. It very much has to do with trade. We have so many bad trade deals. To a point where IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure that we have any good trade deals. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know who the people are that would put us into a NAFTA, which was so one-sided. Both from the Canada standpoint and from the Mexico standpoint. So one-sided. Wilbur [Ross, the secretary of commerce] will tell you that, you know, like, at the court in Canada, we always lose. Well, the judges are three Canadians and two Americans. We always lose. But weÃ¢ÂÂre not going to lose any more. And so itÃ¢ÂÂs very, very unfair.

Trump on Trumponomics:Nationalism plus flexibility

Leader:The impulsiveness and shallowness of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs president threaten the economy as well as the rule of law

Briefing 1:Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs economic strategy

Briefing 2:The contradiction at the heart of Trumponomics

Briefing 3:What Donald Trump means by fair trade

Now at the same time I have a very good relationship with Justin [Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister] and a very good relationship with the president of Mexico. And I was going to terminate NAFTA last week, I was all set, meaning the six-month termination. I was going to send them a letter, then after six months, itÃ¢ÂÂs gone. But the word got out, they called and they said, we would really love toÃ¢ÂÂ¦they called separately but it was an amazing thing. They called separately ten minutes apart. I just put down the phone with the president of Mexico when the prime minister of Canada called. And they both asked almost identical questions. Ã¢ÂÂWe would like to know if it would be possible to negotiate as opposed to a termination.Ã¢ÂÂ And I said, Ã¢ÂÂYes, it is. Absolutely.Ã¢ÂÂ So, so we did that and weÃ¢ÂÂll start.

We have a problem because we have a ridiculous provision in NAFTA that we have, you know, to go on the fast track. Fast track is the slowest track IÃ¢ÂÂve ever seen. To go on the fast track you have to give notice. Well we gave notice 70 days ago. ItÃ¢ÂÂs called a cooling-off period, OK? But thatÃ¢ÂÂs not the way life works because when they call and they want to make a deal, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to have to wait a hundred days. So I put the papers in almost 70 days ago, to get the approval for fast track in Congress. And they still havenÃ¢ÂÂt given me approval. And the reason they havenÃ¢ÂÂt is because our trade negotiator, who, as you know, the provision goes with your negotiator. It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt go from the time you put it in, it goes with your negotiator. So he just got approved. HeÃ¢ÂÂll be in sometime, I guess next week?

Steve Mnuchin: Yep, yep.

President Trump: And the clock starts ticking. But here you have two people calling saying, Ã¢ÂÂCan we negotiate?Ã¢ÂÂ I say yes and I have to wait for a hundred days. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know what a hundred days is going to be like. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs it going to be like? So NAFTAÃ¢ÂÂs a horrible one-sided deal thatÃ¢ÂÂs cost us millions and millions of jobs and cost us tens of billions of dollars.

It sounds like youÃ¢ÂÂre imagining a pretty big renegotiation of NAFTA. What would a fair NAFTA look like?

Big isnÃ¢ÂÂt a good enough word. Massive.

Huge?

ItÃ¢ÂÂs got to be. ItÃ¢ÂÂs got to be.

What would it look like? What would a fair NAFTA look like?

No, itÃ¢ÂÂs gotta be. Otherwise we're terminating NAFTA.

What would a fair NAFTA look like?

I was all set to terminate, you know? And this wasnÃ¢ÂÂt likeÃ¢ÂÂ¦this wasnÃ¢ÂÂt a game I was playing. IÃ¢ÂÂm not playingÃ¢ÂÂ¦you know, I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt playing chess or poker or anything else. This was, I was, IÃ¢ÂÂd never even thought aboutÃ¢ÂÂ¦itÃ¢ÂÂs always the best when you really feel this way. But I wasÃ¢ÂÂ¦I had no thought of anything else, and these two guys will tell you, I had no thought of anything else but termination. But because of my relationship with both of them, I said, I would like to give that a try too, thatÃ¢ÂÂs fine. I mean, out of respect for them. It wouldÃ¢ÂÂve been very disrespectful to Mexico and Canada had I said, Ã¢ÂÂI will not.Ã¢ÂÂ

But Mr President, what has to change for you not to withdraw?

We have to be able to make fair deals. Right now the United States has a 70Ã¢ÂÂalmost a $70bn trade deficit with Mexico. And it has about a $15bn dollar trade deficit with Canada. The timber coming in from Canada, theyÃ¢ÂÂve been negotiating for 35 years. And itÃ¢ÂÂs beenÃ¢ÂÂ¦itÃ¢ÂÂs been terrible for the United States. You know, itÃ¢ÂÂs just, itÃ¢ÂÂs just been terrible. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve never been able to make it.

Does that $70bn deficit have to come to zero to be fair?

Not necessarily. And certainly it can come over a, you know, fairly extended period of time, because IÃ¢ÂÂm not looking to shock the system. But it has to become at least fair. And no, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have to immediately go to zero. But at some point would like to get it at zero, where sometimes we can be up and sometimes they can be up.

YouÃ¢ÂÂve talked about reciprocal taxes. Do you imagine that with lots of countries on lots of products or is that a negotiating tool?

No, I think it can be conceivably with lots of countries. The thing thatÃ¢ÂÂs bad about the hundred days is, I said the other day, I said, Ã¢ÂÂWhen do we start this negotiation?Ã¢ÂÂ They said, Ã¢ÂÂSir, it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt kicked in yetÃ¢ÂÂ because it goes with [Robert] Lighthizer, whoÃ¢ÂÂs our, you know, our representative, who I think is going to do a very good job. I said, Ã¢ÂÂYou must be kidding.Ã¢ÂÂ So itÃ¢ÂÂs a real deficit. Now thatÃ¢ÂÂs a NAFTA thing. Because everything in NAFTA is bad. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs bad, everythingÃ¢ÂÂs bad. But in the case of South Korea we have a deal that was made by Hillary Clinton, itÃ¢ÂÂs a horrible deal. And that is the five-year anniversary and itÃ¢ÂÂs up for renegotiation and weÃ¢ÂÂve informed them that weÃ¢ÂÂll negotiate. And again, we want a fair deal. We donÃ¢ÂÂt want a one-sided deal our way but we want fair deals. And if we can have fair deals our country is going to do very well.

Some people think this is a negotiating tacticÃ¢ÂÂthat you say very dramatic things but actually you would settle for some very small changes. Is that right?

No, itÃ¢ÂÂs not, really not a negotiation. ItÃ¢ÂÂs really not. No, will I settle for less than I go in with? Yes, I mean who wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt? Nobody, you know, I always use the word flexibility, I have flexibility. [Goes off the record.] [Our] relationship with China is long. Of course by China standards, itÃ¢ÂÂs very short [laughter], you know when IÃ¢ÂÂm with [Xi Jinping], because heÃ¢ÂÂs great, when IÃ¢ÂÂm with him, heÃ¢ÂÂs a great guy. He was telling me, you know they go back 8,000 years, we have 1776 is like modern history. They consider 1776 like yesterday and they, you know, go back a long time. They talk about the different wars, it was very interesting. We got along great. So I told them, I said, Ã¢ÂÂWe have a problem and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to solve that problem.Ã¢ÂÂ But he wants to help us solve that problem.

Now then you never know whatÃ¢ÂÂs going to happen. But they said to me that on the currency manipulation, Ã¢ÂÂDonald Trump has failed to call China a currency manipulatorÃ¢ÂÂ. Now I have to understand something. IÃ¢ÂÂm dealing with a man, I think I like him a lot. I think he likes me a lot. We were supposed to meet for ten minutes and they go to 40-person meetings, OK, in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. And the ten minutes turned out to be three hours, alone, the two of us. The next day it was supposed to be ten minutes and then we go to our 40-person meeting. That, too, he was, noÃ¢ÂÂ¦because you guys were waiting for a long time. That ten minute meeting turned out to be three hours. Dinner turned out to be three hours. I mean, heÃ¢ÂÂs a great guy.

Now, with that in mind, heÃ¢ÂÂs representing China and he wants whatÃ¢ÂÂs best for China. But so far, you know, heÃ¢ÂÂs been, heÃ¢ÂÂs been very good. But, so they talk about why havenÃ¢ÂÂt you called him a currency manipulator? Now think of this. I say, Ã¢ÂÂJinping. Please help us, letÃ¢ÂÂs make a deal. Help us with North Korea, and by the way weÃ¢ÂÂre announcing tomorrow that youÃ¢ÂÂre a currency manipulator, OK?Ã¢ÂÂ They never say that, you know the fake media, they never put them together, they always say, he didnÃ¢ÂÂt call him a currency [manipulator], number one. Number two, theyÃ¢ÂÂre actually not a currency [manipulator]. You know, since IÃ¢ÂÂve been talking about currency manipulation with respect to them and other countries, they stopped.

Mr Mnuchin: Right, as soon as the president got elected they went the other way.

One last question on trade. Do you think youÃ¢ÂÂve permanently changed the Republican PartyÃ¢ÂÂs position on trade?

No. Because thereÃ¢ÂÂll always be someone that comes along with another idea but itÃ¢ÂÂs not a better idea. We have the better idea. But yeah, I think that a lot of the, like for instance today, health care. Very big thing. Very big. And it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt two bites of the apple. It was one bite. Somebody set a time limit and that was mistake, I said never set a time limit but somebody set a time limit. So when they didnÃ¢ÂÂt meet that time limit they said, Ã¢ÂÂWe didnÃ¢ÂÂt get it thereÃ¢ÂÂ, well, they shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have set a time limit.

On another element of Trumponomics, immigrationÃ¢ÂÂ¦

Right.

Do you want to curb legal immigration?

Oh sure, you know, I want to stop illegal immigration.

And what about legal immigration? Do you want to cut the number of immigrants?

Oh legal, no, no, no. I want people to come into the country legally. No, legally? No. I want people to come in legally. But I want people to come in on merit. I want to go to a merit-based system. Actually two countries that have very strong systems are Australia and Canada. And I like those systems very much, theyÃ¢ÂÂre very strong, theyÃ¢ÂÂre very good, I like them very much. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to a much more merit-based system. But I absolutely want talented people coming in, I want people that are going to love our country coming in, I want people that are going to contribute to our country coming in. We want a provision at the right time, we want people that are coming in and will commit to not gettingÃ¢ÂÂ¦not receiving any form of subsidy to live in our country for at least a five-year period.

But the numbers of those people could be as high as the numbers that are coming in legally now? YouÃ¢ÂÂre not looking to reduce the numbers?

Oh yeah, no, no, no, no, we want people coming in legally. No, very strongly. Now theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to be much more strongly vetted as you see. You know, weÃ¢ÂÂve broken the all-time record [of detentions at the border] by many times, 73, weÃ¢ÂÂre up to 73, itÃ¢ÂÂs going to go up to almost 80% at the border, weÃ¢ÂÂveÃ¢ÂÂ¦you know, really stopped it. We also want farm workers to be able to come in. You know, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have work visas for the farm workers. If you look, you know we have a lot of people coming through the border, theyÃ¢ÂÂre great people and they work on the farms and then they go back home. We like those people a lot and we want them to continue to come in.

Another part of your overall plan, the tax reform plan. Is it OK if that tax plan increases the deficit? Ronald ReaganÃ¢ÂÂs tax reform didnÃ¢ÂÂt.

Well, it actually did. But, but itÃ¢ÂÂs called priming the pump. You know, if you donÃ¢ÂÂt do that, youÃ¢ÂÂre never going to bring your taxes down. Now, if we get the health-care [bill through Congress], this is why, you know a lot of people said, Ã¢ÂÂWhy isnÃ¢ÂÂt he going with taxes first, thatÃ¢ÂÂs his wheelhouse?Ã¢ÂÂ Well, hey look, I convinced many people over the last two weeks, believe me, many Congressmen, to go with it. And theyÃ¢ÂÂre great people, but one of the great things about getting health care is that we will be saving, I mean anywhere from $400bn to $900bn.

Mr Mnuchin: Correct.

President Trump: That all goes into tax reduction. Tremendous savings.

But beyond that itÃ¢ÂÂs OK if the tax plan increases the deficit?

It is OK, because it wonÃ¢ÂÂt increase it for long. You may have two years where youÃ¢ÂÂllÃ¢ÂÂ¦you understand the expression Ã¢ÂÂprime the pumpÃ¢ÂÂ?

Yes.

We have to prime the pump.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs very Keynesian.

WeÃ¢ÂÂre the highest-taxed nation in the world. Have you heard that expression before, for this particular type of an event?

Priming the pump?

Yeah, have you heard it?

Yes.

Have you heard that expression used before? Because I havenÃ¢ÂÂt heard it. I mean, I justÃ¢ÂÂ¦I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. ItÃ¢ÂÂs what you have to do.

ItÃ¢ÂÂsÃ¢ÂÂ¦

Yeah, what you have to do is you have to put something in before you can get something out.

Mr Mnuchin: And as we talked about, economic growth under the Trump administration could increase revenues as much as $2trn over the ten-year period of time. So priming the pump in the short term leads to growth.

So you would have a bigger deficit, a stimulus, to prime the pump that would lead to faster growth?

So I happen to think that 3% is low. But you canÃ¢ÂÂt do it if your companies are leaving the country because taxes are too high. Now, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to do something there too. If our companies leave the country, number one theyÃ¢ÂÂre leaving for numerous reasons but one of the big reasons is the taxes are so high. When they leaveÃ¢ÂÂgo back to trade for a second, when they leave the country, go to a certain country wherever it may be, and they fire all their workers in the United States and on the assumption they build cars or air conditioners or whatever theyÃ¢ÂÂre building, and they open a plant someplace else and then they send the air conditioner or the car into our country with no tax, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not going to happen anymore. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre going to have a very large tax to pay, in the vicinity of 35%.

Now when you do that, number one they're not leaving the country anyway. So weÃ¢ÂÂre not leaving. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know if you saw whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening. Ford has announced massive expansions in the United States. General Motors cancelled a big plant in Mexico and a big plant in Europe. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre all cancelling plans because I told them, I saidÃ¢ÂÂ¦I get along with them great. But I said, Ã¢ÂÂLook, we donÃ¢ÂÂt mind if you leave the country. You can build all you want out of country, I hope you enjoy your plant. But when you build your car, youÃ¢ÂÂre going to have a 35% tax when you bring it back in. And if your numbers work, we wish you well. But thatÃ¢ÂÂs what youÃ¢ÂÂre going to have. YouÃ¢ÂÂre going to have a 35% tax.Ã¢ÂÂ

So I mean, I have, it has, I havenÃ¢ÂÂt been given massive credit for it yet, but I have been given some because I just see polls out in Michigan and different places, that really are affected by this, have been unbelievable, you know, much bigger than election day. But thatÃ¢ÂÂs not a tax increase, thatÃ¢ÂÂs no tax. In other words, all you have to do is donÃ¢ÂÂt leave and you wonÃ¢ÂÂt have aÃ¢ÂÂ¦but weÃ¢ÂÂre bringing our taxes down so low that you wonÃ¢ÂÂt even need the barrier because the taxes are so low, that people are going to stay.

The other thing, just in case weÃ¢ÂÂ¦I believe it could be anywhere from $4trn to $5trn outside, you know donÃ¢ÂÂt forget weÃ¢ÂÂve been talking about $2.5trn for four years now. IÃ¢ÂÂve been using $2.5trn, the same number weÃ¢ÂÂve all been using for years. Well, you know, it grows. I think itÃ¢ÂÂ¦I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be surprised if it was $5trn but, you know, weÃ¢ÂÂre close. WeÃ¢ÂÂre letting that money come back in. And that has two barriers which you have to watch. ItÃ¢ÂÂs got a barrier of the tax, which we will take care of. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to make it 10%. Now itÃ¢ÂÂs 35%...

Sorry, 10%? The repatriation taxes?

The repatriation. Inversion. The corporate inversions, which is a disaster, with the companies leaving. But they want to bring back their money. Number one, the tax is too high but the other thing thatÃ¢ÂÂs too high is the bureaucracy.

Mr Mnuchin: Correct.

President Trump: I have a friend who said even if you wanted to bring it back in you canÃ¢ÂÂt because you have to go through so many papers, so many documents, so manyÃ¢ÂÂ¦

Mr Mnuchin: WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to make it simple

President Trump: You have to doÃ¢ÂÂ¦Steve, they told me youÃ¢ÂÂve got to sign books and books of stuff, you pay millions of dollars in legal fees and they almost donÃ¢ÂÂt allow you to bring it back in.

Can I ask you a question about the politics of tax?

It should be like one page.

The politics of this? Do you need to get Democratic support to get this tax plan passed?

Um. Little bit.

And to get Democratic support, they preferÃ¢ÂÂ¦

Depending. It depends on which plan, you know, which concept weÃ¢ÂÂve got toÃ¢ÂÂ¦but it could be. But I think the Democrats are going to like it. We may align it with infrastructure, which they like. They like it as much as the Republicans like it. We need infrastructure in our country. This country has wasted $6trn in the Middle East. Wasted. Like taking it and throwing it right out that window. Right in to the Rose Garden. See that beautiful Rose Garden? Look at those very nicely dressed people. ItÃ¢ÂÂs religious liberty out there. [NB. Immediately after this interview, President Trump was due to sign an executive order promoting religious liberty.]

Mr President, can I just try you on a deal-making question? If you do need Democratic support for your tax plan, your ideal tax plan, and the price of that the Democrats say is for you to release your tax returns, would you do that?

I donÃ¢ÂÂt know. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a very interesting question. I doubt it. I doubt it. Because theyÃ¢ÂÂre not going toÃ¢ÂÂ¦nobody cares about my tax return except for the reporters. Oh, at some point IÃ¢ÂÂll release them. Maybe IÃ¢ÂÂll release them after IÃ¢ÂÂm finished because IÃ¢ÂÂm very proud of them actually. I did a good job.

Hope Hicks [White House director of strategic communication]: Once the audit is over.

President Trump: I might release them after IÃ¢ÂÂm out of office.

Mr Mnuchin: Just so you know, IÃ¢ÂÂve already started meeting with Democratic senators and, you know, the support has been pretty interesting. I mean, I think a lot of the Democratic senators actually believe weÃ¢ÂÂre on to the right tax plan to bring back business to America, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what theyÃ¢ÂÂre all about, they want to grow jobs in their states, just like the president does.

Ms Hicks: And our plan has things like child-care tax credits which have never been presented beforeÃ¢ÂÂ¦



President Trump: By the way, so as you know IÃ¢ÂÂm under routine audit, so theyÃ¢ÂÂre not going to be done. But you know, at a certain point, thatÃ¢ÂÂs something I will consider. But I would never consider it as part of a deal.

Right, got that.

I would never do it. That would beÃ¢ÂÂ¦I think that would be unfair to the deal. It would be disrespectful of the importance of this deal. Because the only people that find that important are the reporters.

Well, the Democrats say itÃ¢ÂÂs important.

Well, don't forget I got elected without it. Somebody said, Ã¢ÂÂOh but you have to do it,Ã¢ÂÂ I said, Ã¢ÂÂLook where I amÃ¢ÂÂ. I was, you know, I was out front, I was asked that question, every debate, I said, you know, IÃ¢ÂÂm under routine audit.

Mr Mnuchin: And the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs financial disclosure has been longer than anyÃ¢ÂÂ¦



President Trump: Plus my financial disclosure is 104 pages.

Ms Hicks: I think when people say that that makes it about the president and the politics versus the people, which is what weÃ¢ÂÂre focused on.

President Trump: Right.

Can I ask you about the focus of the tax cut because youÃ¢ÂÂve spoken about a massive tax cut for ordinary workersÃ¢ÂÂ¦

Right, this would be the biggest tax cut in the history of the country.

But the biggest winners from this tax cut, right now, look as though they will be the very wealthiest Americans.

Well, I donÃ¢ÂÂt believe that. Because theyÃ¢ÂÂre losing all of their deductions, I can tell you.

But something like eliminating the estate tax.

I get more deductions, I mean I can tell you this, I get more deductions, they have deductions for birds flying across America, they have deductions for everything. There are more deductionsÃ¢ÂÂ¦now youÃ¢ÂÂre going to get an interest deduction, and a charitable deduction. But weÃ¢ÂÂre not going to have all this nonsense that they have right now that complicates things and makes itÃ¢ÂÂ¦you know when we put out that one page, I said, we should really put out a, you know, a big thing, and then I looked at the one page, honestly itÃ¢ÂÂs pretty well covered. Hard to believe.

Will you keep interest deduction in the corporate tax? Will corporate interest paymentsÃ¢ÂÂ¦

Do you want to answer?

Mr Mnuchin: WeÃ¢ÂÂre contemplating it. WeÃ¢ÂÂre contemplating it.

Contemplating getting rid of it?

Mr Mnuchin: No, weÃ¢ÂÂre contemplating keeping it. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs our preference. But weÃ¢ÂÂll look at everything.

So what would your preference be Mr President? You know about that very well.

No, I would say probablyÃ¢ÂÂ¦I think weÃ¢ÂÂre contemplating is the word. And it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been determined yet, but weÃ¢ÂÂre contemplating.

ContemplatingÃ¢ÂÂ¦

WeÃ¢ÂÂre contemplating variousÃ¢ÂÂ¦I have to say, weÃ¢ÂÂre contemplating various things, but one of the things thatÃ¢ÂÂs very important is simplicity. We want to keep it as simple as possible. Because even if you do, itÃ¢ÂÂs complicated. I mean even if you keep it simple with taxes it gets complicated.

And are you contemplating things outside of corporate income tax? For example a VAT, which many countries have?

Well, you know, a lot of people consider the border tax a form of VAT.

Are you stillÃ¢ÂÂ¦

Part of the problem with NAFTA is that MexicoÃ¢ÂÂs a VAT. So Mexico is paying almostÃ¢ÂÂ¦we pay 17%. So we are now down 17%, going into Mexico when we trade. So thatÃ¢ÂÂs like, you have a football team and every time they play a game, theyÃ¢ÂÂre down, you know, 25 points. How can you possibly do good?

But would you considerÃ¢ÂÂ¦

You could actually make the case, that the 17 is doubled. You can make that case. You know, itÃ¢ÂÂs 17 and itÃ¢ÂÂs really 17 and itÃ¢ÂÂs a double.

Mr Mnuchin: Right

Would you consider a VAT for the United States?

Well the concept of VAT I really like. But let me give you the bad news. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think it can be sold in this country because weÃ¢ÂÂre used to an income tax, weÃ¢ÂÂre used to aÃ¢ÂÂ¦people are used to this tax, whether they like it or don't like, theyÃ¢ÂÂre used to this tax. I fully understand because I have a lot of property in the UK. And itÃ¢ÂÂs, sort of, not a bad tax. And every time I pay it, they end up sending it back to me. In fact, my accountant is always sayingÃ¢ÂÂ¦

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a good tax.

No, itÃ¢ÂÂs really not so bad. Like, I own Turnberry in Scotland. And every time I pay they say, Ã¢ÂÂYes sir, you pay it now but you get it back next year.Ã¢ÂÂ I said, Ã¢ÂÂWhat kind of tax is this, I like this tax.Ã¢ÂÂ But the VAT isÃ¢ÂÂ¦I like it, I like it a lot, in a lot of ways. I donÃ¢ÂÂt mean because of, you know, getting it back, you donÃ¢ÂÂt get all of it back, but you get a lot of it back. But I like a VAT. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think it can be sold in this country, I think itÃ¢ÂÂs too much of a shock to this system. I can tell you if we had a VAT it would make dealing with Mexico very much easier. Because it could neutralise. And I really mean that. Part of the problem with NAFTA, the day they signed it, it was a defective deal. Because Mexico has almost a 17% VAT tax and itÃ¢ÂÂs very much of a hidden tax, people donÃ¢ÂÂt see it. So, but these guys, instead of renegotiating the following weekÃ¢ÂÂ¦many years ago, how old is that? 35?

Mr Mnuchin: 35 years ago.

President Trump: But instead of negotiating, we suffered with this for, you know, for decades.

But as you said Mr President, a border-adjustment tax has some similarities to that. Are you still considering a border-adjustment tax?

We are dealing with CongressÃ¢ÂÂ¦because itÃ¢ÂÂs not really what IÃ¢ÂÂm considering. I mean look, on health care, I think we have a great bill and thereÃ¢ÂÂs still a little bit further to go because weÃ¢ÂÂre also dealing with the Senate, but the Senate I believe really wants to get something done because Obamacare is dead, just so we understand. Obamacare is absolutely dead. The insurance companies are leaving. Yesterday Aetna just announced theyÃ¢ÂÂre pulling out. You have states that arenÃ¢ÂÂt going to have any insurance companies. You know when people say, Ã¢ÂÂOh, Obamacare is so wonderful,Ã¢ÂÂ there is no Obamacare, itÃ¢ÂÂs dead. Plus weÃ¢ÂÂre subsidising it and we donÃ¢ÂÂt have to subsidise it. You know if I ever stop wanting to pay the subsidies, which I will.

YouÃ¢ÂÂd pull the plug on that? If this bill doesnÃ¢ÂÂt go through youÃ¢ÂÂd stop those subsidies?

No, this bill only gives them one month. They donÃ¢ÂÂt realize that, thatÃ¢ÂÂs another thing. Good point. This bill gives them one month, it gave, you know the subsidyÃ¢ÂÂ¦

The continuation of the subsidy?

The subsidy to the insurance companies, yes. Anytime I want because actuallyÃ¢ÂÂ¦

But my question is if the bill doesnÃ¢ÂÂt passÃ¢ÂÂ¦

In actuality Congress has to approve it. CongressÃ¢ÂÂ¦

If the bill doesnÃ¢ÂÂt pass would you cut the subsidies?

If the bill doesnÃ¢ÂÂt pass, IÃ¢ÂÂd be in a different position. Because, if the bill didnÃ¢ÂÂt pass the Republicans would have let me down. And then IÃ¢ÂÂd have to decide what I want to do because I want people to have health care. Our health care is much better than Obamacare. ItÃ¢ÂÂs going to be much less expensive. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to have competition, weÃ¢ÂÂre getting rid of the state lines, etc etc. The premiums are going to be low, the deductibles are going to be low. If it didnÃ¢ÂÂt passÃ¢ÂÂ¦itÃ¢ÂÂs a great question, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to think about that but the answer isÃ¢ÂÂ¦I would do something to make sure the people have health care, as bad as Obamacare is.

One of the things that was so different about your campaign message compared to other Republicans was, you said things like Ã¢ÂÂI want everyone to be coveredÃ¢ÂÂ.

WeÃ¢ÂÂre not going to let people die on the streets.

But some people will look at this bill and say, hang on, a lot of people are going to lose their coverage.

OK. So we have a pool for people that are having difficulty. We have got a pool. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a high-risk pool. And this pool we just funded yesterday, weÃ¢ÂÂre putting in $8bn, into the pool. So depending on what states doÃ¢ÂÂ¦because I would like to see states taking over health care, I think they could do a better job than the federal government. Now in some cases thatÃ¢ÂÂll be great, like in Florida that works fantastically with Rick Scott, and a couple of others. And in some states it isnÃ¢ÂÂt, where theyÃ¢ÂÂre not equipped to do it. But ultimately, you know I use the expression, Ã¢ÂÂIf you have a bad knee, I would rather have the federal government focus on North Korea than fixing your knee.Ã¢ÂÂ

The state governments are in much better position to, you know, help people. In terms of, you know, just the size, the mere size of it. But weÃ¢ÂÂre putting in $8bn and youÃ¢ÂÂre going to have absolute coverage. YouÃ¢ÂÂre going to have absolute guaranteed coverage. YouÃ¢ÂÂre going to have it if youÃ¢ÂÂre a person going inÃ¢ÂÂ¦donÃ¢ÂÂt forget, this was not supposed to be the way insurance works. Insurance is, youÃ¢ÂÂre 20 years old, you just graduated from college, and you start paying $15 a month for the rest of your life and by the time youÃ¢ÂÂre 70, and you really need it, youÃ¢ÂÂre still paying the same amount and thatÃ¢ÂÂs really insurance.

But I believe itÃ¢ÂÂs very important to have this. Because one thing Obamacare did, is it gave that and it was a concept that people hadnÃ¢ÂÂt heard of. And now I don't want to end it. I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to end it for somebody thatÃ¢ÂÂ¦first of all I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to end it for the people that already have it. And I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to end it for somebody that hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been buying insurance for all of his life where he has a guarantee that for all of his life heÃ¢ÂÂs been buying the insurance and he can buy it inexpensively when he turns 65 or 70 years old. So we put in a tremendous amount and weÃ¢ÂÂreÃ¢ÂÂ¦you know, for the pre-existing conditions. We are going to have a great pool for pre-existing conditions.

Now, that will even get better as itÃ¢ÂÂs going along, itÃ¢ÂÂs going to get better. But in a way you could say, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not really insurance, but it's there. And I want to make it asÃ¢ÂÂ¦I want to make it actually better than what they have in Obama[care]. Now, Obama[care] has something thatÃ¢ÂÂs very, very bad. Where you have to pay a penalty. And people don't realise, how many people are forced to pay a penalty and they donÃ¢ÂÂt get any benefit out of it. We donÃ¢ÂÂt have that. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to have much lower premiums and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have much lower deductibles.

But when you used to say the hard right of the Republicans canÃ¢ÂÂt be trusted to look after peopleÃ¢ÂÂ¦

IÃ¢ÂÂll be honest with youÃ¢ÂÂ¦Did anybody ever hear of a guy named Mike Pence? Vice-president of the United States?

Mike Pence, the vice-president, enters the room: Morning all.

President Trump: Central casting.

Mr Pence: Please sit, sit, sit.

Ms Hicks: We got about two more minutes. So just one more question.

President Trump: So I know exactly the speeches youÃ¢ÂÂre talking about. I said, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm not going to allow people to die on the streetsÃ¢ÂÂ, and I said it over and over and I meant it more than anything and I probably mean it more now than even when I made the speech. WeÃ¢ÂÂre talking about the high-risk pools, Mike, and we just added $8bn to the high-risk pools.

Mr Pence: Yes, sir.

President Trump: People are going to haveÃ¢ÂÂ¦theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to have great insurance. Now, we have one more step to go. You know we have to go through the Senate and weÃ¢ÂÂre refining it even further. But I will tell you, Mike, I just spoke to a few of the senators and they have some great ideas also and they want to get it there.

So, the problem with Obamacare? He rushed it through, he wantedÃ¢ÂÂ¦although, when I say rushed it through, at the end. They were giving up everything, they were taking out everything. It wasnÃ¢ÂÂt a pure form of what they wanted anyway. They did the Nebraska trade where basically it was, you know, the whole thing was given away.

Look, Obamacare was a disaster. Under Obam"	0
413	"Democrats about lost their minds when they heard that President Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio this morning. Arpaio, convicted of a bogus charge for doing the job the people of Maricopa County elected him to do, was about to spend the next 12 to 18 months in a federal minimum security prison.

His second pardon of the day, while not as immediately necessary, held just as much meaning. By granting clemency to Kim Davis, the Kentucky County Clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, her record will be expunged and her good name reinstated. Davis has been seeing a probation officer monthly since the incident nearly two years ago now to prove sheÃ¢ÂÂs in compliance with the judgeÃ¢ÂÂs orders.

With her record cleared, she no longer has to check in with anyone or list herself on job, volunteer and credit applications as a criminal. A criminal is the farthest thing from what she is. SheÃ¢ÂÂs a conscientious freedom fighter who wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt stand by while her rights were trampled and her very existence threatened.

SheÃ¢ÂÂs the perfect candidate for a Trump pardon, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs exactly what she got. Davis is expected to return to her job in the ClerkÃ¢ÂÂs office where she can now refuse to issue marriage licences to gays and not worry about it becoming a Ã¢ÂÂnational scandal.Ã¢ÂÂ Davis said, Ã¢ÂÂI told them all along I didnÃ¢ÂÂt care if they went to the county down the street. Just not in my building. Not while my God still relies on me to do the right thing.Ã¢ÂÂ

God Bless you, Kim Davis. YouÃ¢ÂÂre a real piece of work."	1

415	"Malia Obama may have done irreparable harm to her career this morning when she decided to join a gang of thugs in Chicago for a day of drinking, drugs and dogfighting at a public park in Chicago. Malia was arrested along with seven others and charged with wanton endangerment of animals, public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance.

She was found in the company of mostly older men when police arrived after being called by a concerned citizen complaining about a loud group of people watching dogs fight in the park. According to a witness:

Ã¢ÂÂThey was all just right out there in the open drinkinÃ¢ÂÂ and lettinÃ¢ÂÂ their dogs go at it. I saw some smoking weed. Some were doing other things I donÃ¢ÂÂt know. All those dudes had that baggy pants thing. They werenÃ¢ÂÂt the types of people youÃ¢ÂÂd expect that girl to be with.Ã¢ÂÂ

According to the Secret Service, Malia had slipped away late last night after being told open air parties at public parks were too dangerous. She wasnÃ¢ÂÂt seen again until she showed up in the 12th precinct jail. Her parents have not been available for comment.

Public records show she was released on her own recognizance and given a court date of later this month for arraignment."	1

Target CEO Brian Cornell announced today the retail giant will be discontinuing sales of the Holy Bible. The company has come under fire recently from religious groups for its new transgender bathroom policy. The King James Bible has been available for purchase at Target stores ever since the company was founded as Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902.

Speaking with CNBC, Cornell cited recent protests from what he calls Ã¢ÂÂreligious extremistsÃ¢ÂÂ as the reason to pull the bible from its shelves. Ã¢ÂÂTarget will no longer cater to religious extremists,Ã¢ÂÂ said Cornell. Ã¢ÂÂIf that means removing the bible from our shelves, then so be it.Ã¢ÂÂ Cornell said the big box chain is Ã¢ÂÂsticking to its gunsÃ¢ÂÂ regarding their bathroom policy, and will be phasing out anything having to do with religion. Ã¢ÂÂWe believe that everyone, every team member, every guest, and every community, deserves to be treated equally, regardless of their religious beliefs.Ã¢ÂÂ

419	"De Soto, Missouri Ã¢ÂÂ Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their child cooked in the microwave.

According to police report, the young parents, were out at the movies before they came back home to find a confused babysitter under the influence of alcohol and crystal meth who had lost consciousness and was covered in blood in the familyÃ¢ÂÂs living room.

Moments later, the parents made the gruesome discovery when the young mother saw something moving in microwave.

The 16-year-old babysitter named Ã¢ÂÂAnna RitchieÃ¢ÂÂ, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became hungry and eventually lost consciousness.

Ã¢ÂÂI just took a few hits because I was bored and wanted to stay awake,Ã¢ÂÂ she told Officer Robert. Ã¢ÂÂAll I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed outÃ¢ÂÂ recalls the police officer, visibly traumatized by the latest events.

The 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to SpringfieldÃ¢ÂÂs Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life.

Ã¢ÂÂApparently, the baby sitter tried to cook the baby in the microwave oven but she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later,Ã¢ÂÂ explained Sheriff Deputy Anderson James of the Jefferson County Police Department. Ã¢ÂÂTeeth marks were found on the babyÃ¢ÂÂs arms and legs but luckily he is unharmedÃ¢ÂÂ he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.

The state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts. A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment."	1

We have just received information that one of the women accusing Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore of soliciting dates from her when she was a teenager and he was in his 30Ã¢ÂÂs is not only a passionate progressive, but she has actually worked for the DNC and is actively campaigning for MooreÃ¢ÂÂs opponent, Doug Jones.

Deborah Wesson Gibson, aka Debbie Gibson, was named in the Washington Post article accusing Moore, and social media evidence makes clear that she is a fervent supporter of Jones and Democrats in general, and has even worked for the DNC.

Wesson Gibson is a sign language interpreter, who has interpreted at rallies for both Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton.

She has also vocalized fervent support for Jones.

Also, of course, she is a vocal opponent of Roy Moore and is clearly dedicated to him losing:

This is not surprising, considering the timing of these wild stories of Moore courting and even sexually groping teenage girls when he was in his 30Ã¢ÂÂs. Moore has been hated passionately by the left for decades, for his consistent dedication to biblical morality.

Consider how suspicious this is Ã¢ÂÂ a woman comes forward 39 years later with a vicious never-before-made accusation Ã¢ÂÂ and how is one suppose to defend oneself and prove it is a lie 39 years later? Welcome to politics in America.

The establishment doesnÃ¢ÂÂt want Roy Moore, a man who canÃ¢ÂÂt be bought or bribed, to pull up their political skirts and overturn their tables of corruption and greed! Roy Moore will win big! Buckle up RINOSÃ¢ÂÂ¦time to meet a real man!

Kayla Moore, Roy MooreÃ¢ÂÂs wife, in an exclusive statement to The Activist Mommy yesterday, told us that Ã¢ÂÂThe Washington Post has been calling and harassing our friends and family, trying to find garbage. WeÃ¢ÂÂve had people back home telling us they are getting phone calls and when they would tell them good things, the Washington Post would ask them if they knew anything bad on him.Ã¢ÂÂ

Well, her story continues to be corroborated, as witnesses have come forward saying the Washington Post, a paper that has officially endorsed Jones, has actually been bribing people to dig up dirt on Moore!

Go figure! This is exactly what Kayla claims has been happening.

Roy Moore had this to say about the fabricated campaign against him:

The Obama-Clinton MachineÃ¢ÂÂs liberal media lapdogs just launched the most vicious and nasty round of attacks against me IÃ¢ÂÂve EVER faced!

We are in the midst of a spiritual battle with those who want to silence our message. The forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ even inflict physical harm Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me.

I believe you and I have a duty to stand up and fight back against the forces of evil waging an all-out war on our conservative values!

Our nation is at a crossroads right now Ã¢ÂÂ both spiritually and politically.

Our children and grandchildrenÃ¢ÂÂs futures are on the line.

So rest assured Ã¢ÂÂ I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!

The Democrats always pull this stunt. Ever since they saw it work for the Clintons theyÃ¢ÂÂve been trying it every chance they get! But they completely underestimate Roy Moore and the people of God.

This is a last-ditch, hail mary pass effort from the Democats to slander a man theyÃ¢ÂÂve hated as long as he has held public office. This fabricated story canÃ¢ÂÂt hold water for long!

This statesman is going through the fires of testing for the survival of this nation. Let us all pray for him and give him our most generous support right now. Visit RoyMoore.org now!!

422	"Updated: ASPEN Ã¢ÂÂ Senator John McCain is meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors here as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention.

They gathered as Mr. McCain gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute Thursday, where he discussed the conflict in the Caucasus and challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper and where he lamented his own lack of appreciation for art and music.

And at a fund-raising event earlier in the day Ã¢ÂÂ one of three Ã¢ÂÂhe told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog.

Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs what I relish and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what I like,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ he said at the first fund-raiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is Ã¢ÂÂabout the size of Senator ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs foreign-policy team.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ



Many on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.

Mr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs president turned prime minister and he called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, Ã¢ÂÂthe first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂMy friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. McCain said. Ã¢ÂÂThis is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, Ã¢ÂÂI have to be against the tax increases, as you know,Ã¢ÂÂ and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, itÃ¢ÂÂs closer to $5 a gallon.

At one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his Ã¢ÂÂmaverickÃ¢ÂÂ stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor?

In a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the Ã¢ÂÂChristian right.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mr. McCain said he had not supported President BushÃ¢ÂÂs tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war.

As for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a Ã¢ÂÂtraitor,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response.

He said he himself had been called Ã¢ÂÂdisloyalÃ¢ÂÂ by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt work. He said he had been Ã¢ÂÂdeclared dead,Ã¢ÂÂ but he was reminded of Chairman MaoÃ¢ÂÂs saying that Ã¢ÂÂitÃ¢ÂÂs always darkest before itÃ¢ÂÂs totally black.Ã¢ÂÂ But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, Ã¢ÂÂhe voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded.Ã¢ÂÂ He added: Ã¢ÂÂI think heÃ¢ÂÂs wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, to sustained applause.

He also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, Ã¢ÂÂwe passed up an opportunityÃ¢ÂÂ to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service.

He also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt work. Ã¢ÂÂThe kind of war theyÃ¢ÂÂre fighting requires long-term commitment,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it.

On the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBAÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂDancing QueenÃ¢ÂÂ was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank SinatraÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve Got You Under My Skin.Ã¢ÂÂ

He said that if heÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂlacking in anything,Ã¢ÂÂ it is an appreciation for music and art and Ã¢ÂÂthe other great things in life,Ã¢ÂÂ partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly.

Ã¢ÂÂEverybody says, Ã¢ÂÂI hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.Ã¢ÂÂHow come everybody goes to Ã¢ÂÂMamma Mia!?Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂEverybody goes! TheyÃ¢ÂÂve been selling out for years.Ã¢ÂÂ

After another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.

Ã¢ÂÂI appreciate art,Ã¢ÂÂ he declared. Ã¢ÂÂIf thereÃ¢ÂÂs one thing IÃ¢ÂÂm going to do and I have the opportunity, itÃ¢ÂÂs to take a class in art.Ã¢ÂÂ He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, Ã¢ÂÂbut some of the things werenÃ¢ÂÂt there that I would like to see.Ã¢ÂÂ

He then added, Ã¢ÂÂBut I make no excuses for my taste in music.Ã¢ÂÂ"	0
423	"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) Ã¢ÂÂ When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn't unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.

He was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.

Was Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?

The answer may never be known, but Castile's stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile's girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.

The shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile's killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.

The Castile video ""is pretty horrific,"" said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. ""There are things we don't know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases Ã¢ÂÂ whether explicit or implicit Ã¢ÂÂ about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.""

Court records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.

Many charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt.

The records show no convictions for more serious crimes.

No recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data.

But in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites.

The analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected.

The St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile's stop since shortly after the shooting.

It was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks.

Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him ""for no apparent reason"" after he reached for his ID.

Valerie Castile said she thinks her son ""was just black in the wrong place."" Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist.

The officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop.

""Police understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,"" said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.

But the statistics can't simply be attributed to racial bias among police.

""When people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,"" said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. ""That counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.""

Last year, the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures.

Nationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics.

The survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers.

The precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing.

""Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we're facing ambiguous situations,"" Fridell said. ""A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren't going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people.""

425	"What Carly is doing tonight Carly Fiorina ÃÂ· Follow 4 min read ÃÂ· Feb 7, 2016 -- 4 Listen Share

Date: February 6, 2016

Subject: ABC: Anyone But Carly

From: Frank F. Sadler, Campaign Manager

To: Friends of Carly

Despite what the media is telling you, it is clear that Carly deserved to be on the debate stage, both according to their arbitrary metrics Ã¢ÂÂ and the ones that actually matter:

* In an actual contest of voters, Carly came out ahead of Governors Christie and Kasich

* She has the same number of delegates as Governor Bush. Governor Christie has 0

* Carly is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash-on-hand than Governors Kasich and Christie combined

* There is a ground game with paid staff in 12 states. In New Hampshire alone, CARLY for America has 12 full-time staff, 500 volunteer community captains and 77 canvassers.

* Carly has endorsements from leaders in 27 states. In New Hampshire alone, we have endorsements from 83 elected officials, political leaders, party activists, and business and community leaders.

* Recent polls Ã¢ÂÂ which are the standard by which ABC is making their decision about which candidates to include Ã¢ÂÂ show Carly ahead of multiple candidates on the stage. A WBUR poll released yesterday has Carly surging to 8%

We know how much this injustice outraged the voters of Iowa Ã¢ÂÂ whose votes were ignored Ã¢ÂÂ and the voters of New Hampshire, who donÃ¢ÂÂt want the media and the political establishment unfairly winnowing the field before they get to vote. So we spoke with executives at ABC and political leaders at the RNC and made our case. But they decided to keep us off the stage to improve the chances of their favored candidates, despite what voters clearly wanted.

And it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt just us. More than 35,000 voters signed a petition to get Carly on the stage. Conservative blog PJ Media polled their readers: 76% said Carly should be on stage. Fox host Greta Van Susteren polled her viewers and 80% agreed that she should be on stage.

Other candidates Ã¢ÂÂ including Ben Carson and Ted Cruz Ã¢ÂÂ called on ABC to change their flawed criteria and put Carly on the stage. So did Republican leaders, including Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich.

Many business and political leaders joined in the chorus and offered their support to Carly:

They all know what we know: the criteria are arbitrary, ineffective, and decidedly weighted to tip the scales in favor of the establishment candidates they media has already approved.

WeÃ¢ÂÂre looking forward to Tuesday night when New Hampshire voters will have their say. We know that no one debate, poll, or event decides anything about this election. That is up to the voters of New Hampshire. They have demonstrated their support for Carly over and over again, showing up to events, asking questions, and protesting this outrageous decision. Despite the efforts of the media and professional political class to stand in her way, Carly will not stop fighting to take our country back.

Instead of the debate, Carly and Frank will be having a date night of dinner and a movie in Room 306."	0

Boston, MA Ã¢ÂÂ Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, ""Remember."" The ad highlights the people of New Hampshire discussing the issues that important to them Ã¢ÂÂ lowering tax burdens, securing our borders and changing Washington. While rightly honored as a true patriot, Senator McCain has opposed tax relief, supported amnesty and is too much of a Washington insider to change Washington. On the issues important to New Hampshire Republicans, Senator McCain has taken the wrong approach.



The ad will begin airing today as part of the campaign's rotation in New Hampshire. Script and viewing links are below.



Script For ""Remember"" (TV:30):



GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: ""I'm Mitt Romney and I approved this message.""



BOB DUFFY: ""I believe John McCain's war record is outstanding.""



MARIE PALING: ""He's a true patriot and has served his country long and well.""

428	"During a flight from New York City to Chicago, violence erupted after a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy. This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.

The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to Ã¢ÂÂquiet that annoying ass baby down.Ã¢ÂÂ

After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the motherÃ¢ÂÂs arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.

The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.

The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. The parents say they are reaching out to an attorney, refusing to give any further statements."	1
429	"Since 1992, the I.R.S. has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion Ã¢ÂÂ a staggering $227.4 million on average Ã¢ÂÂ but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent.

The taxes I refer to here include only federal income tax, but you can be sure that any payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income. In fact, 88 of the 400 in 2008 reported no wages at all, though every one of them reported capital gains. Some of my brethren may shun work but they all like to invest. (I can relate to that.)

I know well many of the mega-rich and, by and large, they are very decent people. They love America and appreciate the opportunity this country has given them. Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering.

Twelve members of Congress will soon take on the crucial job of rearranging our countryÃ¢ÂÂs finances. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve been instructed to devise a plan that reduces the 10-year deficit by at least $1.5 trillion. ItÃ¢ÂÂs vital, however, that they achieve far more than that. Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our countryÃ¢ÂÂs fiscal problems. Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness. That feeling can create its own reality.

Job one for the 12 is to pare down some future promises that even a rich America canÃ¢ÂÂt fulfill. Big money must be saved here. The 12 should then turn to the issue of revenues. I would leave rates for 99.7 percent of taxpayers unchanged and continue the current 2-percentage-point reduction in the employee contribution to the payroll tax. This cut helps the poor and the middle class, who need every break they can get."	0

Executive Vice-President, National Rifle Association

before the

House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime

U. S. House of Representatives May 27, 1999

Our freedoms are already endangered enough by those who oppose them. But I 've learned that a freedom is most at risk when it 's in the hands of honest people who think, for some perceived common good, they ought to give it up.



Today we are a country in shock, still bewildered by what confluence of forces could possibly lead young people to hurt each other.



In that tender state, good people are vulnerable. They want to do something, anything, for the common good. Indeed, some are so perplexed about what to do that legislators admit from the outset that their legislation could not have prevented the very crimes that provoked drafting it.



That's the very definition of a perceived, but fictitious, common good.



As this made-for-TV lawmaking gets played out, it needs a villain. So good Americans have been exposed daily to a well-coordinated systematic bashing of the National Rifle Association 's membership as somehow a reckless societal pathogen, a mighty extremist empire opposed to safety, caution, and reason.



That is a cruel and dangerous lie.



Because nobody --nor any combination of entities you care to add up --has invested even a measurable fraction of what we have invested toward keeping safety and sanity central to the lawful exercise of the Second Amendment.



And nobody is more committed than we are to keeping guns out of criminals 'hands. That's obviously in our best interest. It's just whether you believe you 're more likely to keep guns and criminals apart with new laws you write and ignore, or with existing laws you enforce.



Some think our insistence on enforcement is unreasonable. Others say we oppose reasonable restrictions on gun ownership. So let's talk about what's reasonable and what's not.



We think it 's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone. That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mental ill are in the system.



This isn 't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to

news interviews and press appearances. But I 've repeatedly emphasized that this Administration must stop illegally keeping records of lawful gun buyers.



In fact, it 's the media 's well-kept secret that the NRA was an early architect and supporter of the National Instant Check System now in place. Congressman McCollum knows we worked with him on instant checks more than a decade ago.

We think it 's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and

pawn shops. But what 's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people like felons who 've walked away from gun stores --instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun.



We think it 's reasonable to prevent all juveniles convicted of violent felonies from owning guns,

for life. What's unreasonable is how Lautenberg can prevent your law-abiding son from

inheriting his grandpa 's shotgun collection because Lautenberg classifies him as a gun show dealer who must be federally regulated.



We think it 's reasonable to prosecute more than just two dozen thugs last year for putting illegal guns in criminals 'hands. What 's unreasonable is that Lautenberg considers legal guns in private hands subject to intrusive federal regulation, even in the privacy of your home.



For a century we 've taught it 's not just reasonable but essential to use safety locks, trigger locks, gun safes or any voluntary means appropriate to keep firearms out of the wrong hands. What's unreasonable is that Lautenberg can put you in prison just for failing to keep records on how many guns you own.

We think it 's reasonable to make gun show instant checks just like gun store instant checks.

What's unreasonable is how Lautenberg could define your Walmart, or your uncle 's skeetshooting range, or your next-door firearms collector, or your local sporting clays competition, or

any person or place with 50 or more firearms as a ""gun show "" subject to mtrusive government regulation. That 's crazy!



We think it 's reasonable to demand strict prosecution of criminal activity, whether it takes place in

a big-city alleyway or small town gun show. What 's unreasonable is that Lautenberg instead demands strict registration of law-abiding gun buyers, b oiving the federal government the name and address, type of gun and serial number ---not of criminals but of Americans deemed NOT to be criminals by the instant check!



We think it 's reasonable to provide full funding for the National Instant Check System so it

operates efficiently and instantly. What 's unreasonable is how Lautenberg authorizes an unlimited gun tax on purchases by law-abiding citizens.



We think it 's reasonable to expect our government to prosecute more than 24 hoods last year for providing guns to criminals. What 's unreasonable is how Lautenberg makes everyone

prosecutable if you just talk about buying or selling a gun at a gun show --even if you have no gun in your possession!



We think it 's reasonable to support the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act. What 's unreasonable is letting 6,000 students caught with illegal guns at school go, prosecuting only 13 of them the past

two years.

We think it 's reasonable to demand that when a lawful gun buyer passes the criminal background check and purchases a firearm, records of that transaction be destroyed immediately. What 's unreasonable is Lautenberg 's decree that we trust government bureaucrats to compile and keep

We think it 's reasonable is to expect full enforcement of federal firearms laws by the federal government. What 's unreasonable is when the Justice Department claims that federal gun laws are

for the states to enforce! Reasonable people know that a case made in state court means plea bargains, judge shopping and no mandatory minimum sentencing. Even Mayor Ed Rendell of Philadelphia knows this, even if the Justice Department does not. He said, quote: ""In state court, we average for these types of gun violations a 4-month prison sentence. The federal guidelines are

59 months in prison. That 's a 5 l/2 year difference. Incarcerating convicted felons in possession

of firearms for that length of time will save lives. It will save carnage. It will save people from being maimed. ""



That's why we support Project Exile --the fierce prosecution of federal gun laws that has cut crime rates overnight the few places it 's been tried. Even though this Administration resists it, we think

it's reasonable because it works.



We only support what works, and our proud list is long. From Project Exile to three-strikesyou're out, to truth in sentencin g, to ten-twenty-life, to mandatory minimums --what 's reasonable is what works; what 's unreasonable is what doesn 't work.



What's unreasonable is further erosion of privacy, further intrusion into private transactions, and further government penalizing of the law-abiding many instead of the lawbreaking few. America will not tolerate further surrender of precious freedoms in return for nothing but perceived but

fictitious promises that make none of us safer.



The Lautenberg legislation is not only unreasonable, it is unworkable . . . unacceptable . . . and to

our Founders who gave us the Second Amendment, unthinkable.

And finally --somebody's got to say this out loud: It 's reasonable for well-meaning people to convene hearings like this to find and fashion solutions. What 's unreasonable is when a new level of hate rhetoric becomes acceptable because it 's aimed at honest gun owners, as in the violent language of influential film-maker Spike Lee who last week reportedly said about NRA President Charlton Heston, quote, ""Shoot him --with a .44 caliber Bulldog. "" By his defiant silence, instead

of the quick apology most American role models would offer, he sanctions hate and bears his share

of culpability for the kind of violence this body seeks to stop.

On behalf of millions of gun owners who are NRA members, and tens of millions who are not yet, I am asking you to practice yourselves what is so readily preached to us: Be reasonable.

431	"Apparently, back when President Barack Obama would get high with the Choom Gang, he was tokinÃ¢ÂÂ on some weak product by todayÃ¢ÂÂs standards.

At least, thatÃ¢ÂÂs what one former congressman says.

After Obama told The New Yorker that marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol Ã¢ÂÂ which opened the door to a broader conversation about legalizing or decriminalizing a drug thatÃ¢ÂÂs on the federal governmentÃ¢ÂÂs most restrictive list, Schedule I Ã¢ÂÂ former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., said the president needs to brush up on his pot knowledge.

""I think the president needs to speak to his (National Institute of Health) director in charge of drug abuse,"" said Kennedy, who chairs Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposes legalization. The NIH director ""would tell the president that, in fact, todayÃ¢ÂÂs modern, genetically modified marijuana (has) much higher THC levels, far surpass(ing) the marijuana that the president acknowledges smoking when he was a young person.""

ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs exploits as a pot-smoking adolescent are well documented in his own memoir, Dreams from My Father. More recently , in journalist David MaranissÃ¢ÂÂ biography Barack Obama: The Story, readers learned that Obama as a high schooler in the late 1970s rolled with a group called the Choom Gang Ã¢ÂÂ friends from Hawaii who frequently got high.

But has marijuana changed that much? We decided to investigate.

What is THC?

Cannabis contains roughly 500 compounds, 70 of which are psychoactive. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive ingredient in the marijuana plant.

The level of THC in a plant varies based on the strain. When researchers discuss the potency of marijuana, they typically are measuring the concentration of THC.

THC levels also differ depending on the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. In addition to marijuana, there are materials such as sinsemilla (the flowering tops of unfertilized female plants), hashish or cannabis resin, and hash oil (a concentrated extract from cannabis plants). Hashish oil tends to have much higher concentrations of THC than marijuana or even sinsemilla. Both of these have become more popular in recent years.

But what about marijuana itself? Has weed as we once knew it become more potent?

The answer is: yes. THC levels are on the rise, and they have been for quite some time.

The University of Mississippi Potency Monitoring project analyzed tens of thousands of marijuana samples confiscated by state and federal law enforcement agencies since 1972. The average potency of all seized cannabis has increased from a concentration of 3.4 percent in 1993 to about 8.8 percent in 2008. Potency in sinsemilla in particular has jumped from 5.8 percent to 13.4 percent during that same time period.

Back in the late 1970s when Obama was in high school (he graduated in 1979), the mean potency for marijuana was about 3 percent, said Mahmoud ElSohly, director of marijuana research at Ole Miss.

Further, the number of samples confiscated with a THC concentration greater than 9 percent has increased significantly, from 3.2 percent in 1993 to 21.5 percent of the 1,635 marijuana samples collected in 2007.

But while the average is up due to the availability of marijuana with a higher THC count, the high mark in potency (somewhere around 25-27 percent) remains relatively unchanged in the last couple decades and isnÃ¢ÂÂt likely to increase, ElSohly said.

How did it get so strong?

The former congressman said the reason for the increasing levels of THC is genetic modification. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not quite right.

Genetic modification or genetic engineering involves altering a substanceÃ¢ÂÂs DNA at the molecular level. Producers of marijuana on the illicit market donÃ¢ÂÂt have the ability to pull off those kinds of lab-based modifications.

However, genetic selection involves breeding marijuana plants with the highest concentration of THC. Genetic selection, unlike genetic modification, has been practiced for centuries. Think about how we got different breeds of dogs or varieties of tomatoes.

Genetic selection is quite prevalent in marijuana, ElSohly said. Drug dealers have steered toward these methods in hopes of creating a product that enables them to sell smaller volume at a higher cost.

Cultivation methods that allow growers to control climate, water and soil levels have dramatically improved production as well, he said, and they have a better idea what parts of the plant produce the highest concentration of THC.

There is some genetic engineering of marijuana in labs, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not widespread yet and itÃ¢ÂÂs not the cause for the increase, ElSohly said.

What does it mean?

What does this rise in potency mean in a practical sense? LetÃ¢ÂÂs start with what the National Institutes of Health says, since Kennedy singled out the government agency.

Noting that the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana has increased in recent decades, the NIH warns that ""daily use can have stronger effects on a developing teen brain than it did 10 or 20 years ago.""

Researchers have warned against marijuana use by teens and even young adults, noting that developing brains have an increased risk of dependency. That was an issue even before potency factored in, though the growing strength of the drug does have health officials more concerned.

Those concerns are also directed at populations who had already been advised against smoking marijuana when THC levels were lower, such as individuals with cardiovascular diseases or those with certain mental illness, such as schizophrenia.

But for the average adult recreational or habitual user, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot less certainty about what rising THC levels mean.

Only a handful of studies have looked at how users smoke marijuana with varying THC levels. Several of these studies noted that when test subjects were using more highly concentrated marijuana, they often smoked less than they did when consuming product with a lower THC level.

In that regard, THC would seem to mimic how people consume beverages with different alcohol content: People tend to drink whiskey in shots, wine by the glass and beer by the mug. Marijuana may work the same way, said Carl Hart, a psychology professor at Columbia University who studies the effects of psychoactive drugs.

Roger Roffman, a social work professor at the University of Washington and author of the upcoming book Marijuana Nation, noted that there has been little research on the impact of potency in cannabis at the levels seen today, especially in products like hash oil, meaning we donÃ¢ÂÂt know everything about its potential impact.

Beyond dependency, health officials also warn that smoking marijuana can cause paranoia and in some cases anxiety attacks.

Hospital visits caused by marijuana are on the rise over the last decade, from 359,795 in 2004 to 540,340 in 2011. However, it is unclear if that is caused by higher potency levels, greater usage of marijuana or other factors.

This is all important food for thought, because the debate is ongoing and more research is needed. However, this didn't affect our ruling.

Our ruling

Kennedy said that marijuana today is ""genetically modified,"" with THC levels that ""far surpass the marijuana"" of the 1970s.

Generally speaking, the potency of marijuana has been on the rise since ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs youth, though experts disagree about what impact that rise could have on marijuanaÃ¢ÂÂs negative health effects, in part because the research so far has been incomplete. The most off-base part of KennedyÃ¢ÂÂs claim is that the rise in THC levels comes from ""genetic modification."" ItÃ¢ÂÂs actually from genetic selection, a very old process of producing desired traits from crops. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True."	0

AMERICAN MORNING

Super Tuesday: More Than 20 States, 40 Contests; Super Tuesday Meets the Mortgage Meltdown

Aired February 5, 2008 - 08:00 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



KIRAN CHETRY, CNN ANCHOR: Super Tuesday, more than 20 states, 40 contests. Candidates give their final pitches right here.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



HILLARY CLINTON, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am so committed on to making sure nobody goes without health care.



MITT ROMNEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We want to make sure this party does not leave the house that Ronald Reagan built.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CHETRY: The issues hit home, health care, the housing crisis. We're talking to voters in the north, south, east and in Super Tuesday's biggest prize, California, on this AMERICAN MORNING.



And welcome. It's a special split edition of AMERICAN MORNING on this Super Tuesday. I'm Kiran Chetry. I'm here at one of the local schools up in Harlem, New York, where we've seen good amount of voters trickling in. Polls have been opened here for about two hours, John. And it looks like the action is heating up a little bit behind me as well, as people are coming in before they head to work to cast their votes today.



JOHN ROBERTS, CNN ANCHOR: Good for them. I'm John Roberts. We're at the Atlanta diner here in Atlanta, Georgia. Nobody voting here, but they are fueling up in preparation to get out there and vote. It's as close as we'll come to a national primary. Well, at least this year. 24 states up for grabs today. 1,020 delegates up for grabs for the Republicans. 1,681 available for the Democrats. Most polls are open right now. We're going to be checking in with voters and our reporters across the country this morning. And we have got them from stem to stern here.



Got our team on the issues talking to voters from coast to coast. Candy Crowley is live in Harlem this morning. Ed Lavandera in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Chris Lawrence in San Francisco and Mary Snow is in Charleston, West Virginia.



No primary are caucus there in West Virginia, rather. A state Republican convention that gets under way in about an hour at 9:00 Eastern. 18 delegates at stake there today. And Mary joins us now live from Charleston.



Mary, we were speaking with Mitt Romney this morning who flew overnight from California. There really seems to be a battle in the Republican Party on this Super Tuesday as to who is the real conservative.



MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that really is what it comes down to, John, for Mitt Romney. He has been hammering away at that theme -- that trying to portray himself as the real conservative. Trying to poke holes in Senator John McCain's conservative credentials. Mitt Romney will try to make that case here in West Virginia.



As you mentioned, the convention getting under way just about an hour from now. This will likely be where we'll hear the first results across the country. Ron Paul is also going to be here. Mike Huckabee. Senator John McCain will not be here, but he will have a surrogate here for him. He is heading out to California before heading home to Arizona. Yesterday he concentrated on the northeast.



One of his big themes has been national security. Also cutting government spending. But in terms of the Republican Party, he's trying to make the case, that he can be the uniter. Mitt Romney took his message to California trying to tout his conservative credentials.



ROBERTS: Hey, we should point out, Mary, that we're looking at that polling place in Chappaqua right now. And there Hillary Clinton and her husband coming in to cast their votes. No question who she'll be voting for this morning. But let's go back to the Republican contest.



Where do these candidates need to do well? Obviously, John McCain wants to win the whole thing and become the de facto nominee tonight. But where do the other candidates, Mitt Romney, Ron Paul and Mike Huckabee have to do well to stay in this race?



SNOW: Well, you know, for Mitt Romney, one of the states where he really has to do well is Massachusetts. John McCain was campaigning there. Mitt Romney had been governor. He says he plans on winning there. But that would be a blow to him if he did not win in Massachusetts. And obviously, he's counting a lot in California.



Mike Huckabee wants to gain support here in the south. He's been concentrating on that. And Ron Paul has been focusing on states like West Virginia, also Alaska. He's hoping to pick up delegates.



ROBERTS: All right. Mary Snow for us this morning. Let's take it back to Kiran, who is there at Harlem.



Kiran, you spoke with Senator Clinton a couple of hours ago. She's there casting her ballot in Chappaqua this morning. It took just a couple of seconds as well.



CHETRY: Yes, that's right. She actually went on early, joining us in the 6:00 hour because it's the 7:00 hour here in New York. She wanted to be at the polling site. Senator Clinton casting her vote just a few minutes ago. And earlier on AMERICAN MORNING, she talked about issues like health care and the economy and a last-minute appeal to voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



CLINTON: Really are not taking care of people. I want to put the American people first again. And you know, I think there is a lot of reason for people to worry that the president just doesn't pay attention. And I want them to know that I get it and I'll be there for them, if they are willing to go out and vote for me today. And I hope everybody watching will do that.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CHETRY: Also a big question today, what do people in the south want in their president. Can Mike Huckabee win beyond Arkansas and can Barack Obama win beyond South Carolina? Tennessee, one of the states we're watching in the south. The polls just opened there moments ago.



There are 52 Republican delegates at stake there. 68 for the Democrats and our Ed Lavandera is in Chattanooga. He's been talking with voters this morning. You know, you can't really lump everybody in the same group and say what are southerners thinking this morning. But what is the sense here getting from this that you talk to, Ed?



ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, in speaking with several political analysts who look at these voters in the south, they really see, kind of a divide, between what they call the upper south and the lower south. So you have Arkansas and Tennessee perhaps going one way, maybe voting more alike and then, you have, Georgia and Alabama perhaps being a little bit more similar. But across the south, a big turnout is expected.



(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)



LAVANDERA: Presidential candidates pour on the southern charm like thick gravy on biscuits.



MIKE HUCKABEE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's not often that a razorback comes to Tuscaloosa and has a good time.



JOHN MCCAIN, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: One of my sons attended Vanderbilt University. And he married a beautiful, beautiful young lady from Cookeville. And I am so -- and I am so proud of that as well. So, as you can see, I'm puling out all the stops here everybody.



LAVANDERA: But in the south, candidates know it takes a spiritual connection, too.



BARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know most folks were already in church today. So I don't want to give a whole another sermon. And I won't pass the collection plate.



HILLARY CLINTON, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Every day, I strive to act on the lessons of my faith, to reach that higher place.



LAVANDERA: Across the Super Tuesday southern states of Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas and Alabama, both Obama and Clinton Democrats are embracing the most popular theme on the campaign trail.



UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel like there's a lot of change that needs to happen as, you know, for the whole country. Not just for the south.



LAVANDERA: And some Republican leaning voters remain undecided.



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: John McCain, I kind of leaning toward him in his military service and I like some of the policies that he's put forth. But Huckabee, right now, I'm leaning kind of heavy toward him.



LAVANDERA: Emory University professor Merrill Black studies the mind-set of southern voters and on Super Tuesday, he sees division on the Democratic side.



MERLE BLACK, EMORY UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: I think we're going to see a split here. The Deep South is probably going to go for Obama. The Upper South will probably go for Hillary Clinton.



LAVANDERA: And on the Republican side, he says McCain is in the driver's seat.



BLACK: McCain probably will lead the field, but I think Huckabee could be competitive here. The big question mark is how well Mitt Romney would run in Georgia and Alabama and Tennessee.



(END VIDEOTAPE)



LAVANDERA: And Kiran, you know, there's one voter in all of the south that many people would like to know, how this particular person is voting, al least, on the Democratic side and that is Former Vice President Al Gore who is from Tennessee, of course.



We reached out to his people yesterday and they said that -- we were told that he has already voted. He voted early. But we gave the old college try to find out who he voted for and we were told as a private citizen, he's not sharing that information.



Kiran?



CHETRY: I am sure that everybody can make a few guesses, but he's keeping mum. All right, Ed Lavandera for us in Chattanooga this morning. Thanks.



ROBERTS: Coming up on eight minutes after the hour now. Will weather affect voter turnout on this Super Tuesday? Our Rob Marciano is checking it out for us this morning.



Rob, anybody going to have a difficult time getting out to the polls today?



(WEATHER REPORT)



ROBERTS: We're at the beginning of CNN's nonstop Super Tuesday coverage. 40 hours, all day and all night. And join us for a special early edition of AMERICAN MORNING, 5:00 a.m. Eastern. And join CNN's Campbell Brown for her ""AMERICA VOTES SPECIAL"" talking to candidates and the issues. That's at noon Eastern on CNN and cnn.com.



Kiran?



CHETRY: Well, we've heard from three possible presidents this morning about the issues. What can they do for you? And we're breaking down, what they told us when it comes to key issues like health care and the economy.



Also, Super Tuesday meets the mortgage meltdown. The states voting today where the housing crisis has hit hardest. And how the candidates are promising to fix it? We're going to compare some of their plans. That's coming up ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CHETRY: Welcome back. We've been hearing from the candidates this morning. Let's take a moment to go through what we heard. Senior political correspondent Candy Crowley joins me in Harlem this morning. Breaking down what Democrats talked about. One of the key issues, this morning that we heard from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on health care. And let's just hear quickly what Barack Obama said just moments ago to John Roberts.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



OBAMA: What we do is set up a plan that allows anybody to get health care that is as good as health care to the members of Congress. We will subsidize it for those who can't afford it. People won't be able to be excluded from pre-existing conditions. So that, anybody who is self-employed, anybody who doesn't health insurance or is underinsured can join this plan. Now, we also work to lower costs for those who already have health insurance.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CHETRY: It seems like, well, they are quite similar, Barack Obama is not going as far as saying that people would be mandated to get it if they can afford it. Hillary Clinton is, although, it's still unclear exactly how that would be enforced. But who is winning on this issue? And is this an issue that would sway voters?



CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, they think -- meaning in the camp Hillary, they believe this really is a winning issue. Because she goes out and says -- you know, this is a basic, fundamental Democratic issue. We've got to start with universal health care. He sort of pushes back, as you hear, and says -- listen, I have universal health care. That's where they are going.



I think Democratic voters look at this and say, they are both headed in the same direction. While there are issues in this campaign that divide them, there are about 95 percent in agreement about these issues. And they are 100 percent in agreement as to the direction they want to go.



So in the end, I think Democratic voters come to the polls and sort of say, you know, we have this one candidate who is campaigning on experience. We have another who promises to turn the page. Which direction do we want to go?



CHETRY: You also -- when we were talking briefly before the break, said that, you know, for the Democrats, it's also the issue of who can win it for us this year. And how do the candidates prove that at this point?



CROWLEY: Absolutely. I mean, it's all about electability at this point. And because in the end, what Democrats want is to win the oval office. So they are looking at who is the toughest and that's why you see Barack Obama now talking about John McCain, about electability. You hear him saying, you know, we don't want someone who is divisive, read that Hillary Clinton. She talks about how battle warned she is. How she knows who to go after these Republicans because they've come after her.



So they're both, in their own way, saying I'm the more electable. And that in the end is really what Democratic voters want to know.



CHETRY: She says, according to her, dug up all the dirt they could possibly dig up. So now they're going to go after the fresh meat.



The other interesting element about this is just the way that the Democratic primary caucuses and primaries play out. It's a different situation in terms of gathering delegates. So what does that mean and who gets the advantage, if that's the case?



CROWLEY: You know, first of all, it's so arcane. As you know, it's almost impossible to explain. But basically, what candidates can win a state and still lose the delegates because it's proportionately by district. So what we have to look at tonight is, first of all, who wins the states because in some ways, that's the headline.



You know, in these 20-something states, so and so wins 11 or 12. But the bottom line is that they need 2,050 votes to win this nomination. So they are all counting delegates. And I have to tell you, they are counting delegates district by district. It's why you see Barack Obama in New York. Probably Hillary Clinton will win New York, but if he can sink off enough delegates, then -- you know, he's got something there. Same with Illinois. They, in fact, think that New York will cancel out Illinois. His obviously, his home state.



CHETRY: It is interesting that all the four possible presidential hopefuls, all of them are Super Tuesday states. They are from Super Tuesday states.



CROWLEY: Right. And so you start out thinking, OK, at least here I can do well.



CHETRY: Right. There's a victory somewhere.



CROWLEY: Exactly.



CHETRY: Candy, great to see you as always. Thanks.



John? ROBERTS: Coming up, Kiran, to 17 minutes after the hour. Of course, for the last three weeks, we've been crisscrossing the nation, stopping in at diners in small towns and big cities talking to undecided voters. We've got an undecided voter this morning at the Atlanta Diner.



This is Trina Hackett. I was saying very famous name in New Zealand. They are the people who invented bungee jumping. And you are about to take a leap today. Cast your vote for -- I assume...



TRINA HACKETT, UNDECIDED DEMOCRAT: Hillary.



ROBERTS: Hillary and why is that? You were undecided just a little while ago. What made up your mind here?



HACKETT: I was not truly made my mind. But it's like I'm saying -- more of saying she is very focused and very outstanding with everything that's going on. And more or less, she stands out more because of -- she looks out for the little people. You know -- and she's more focused on the little people. And, you know, and making sure that, you know, that -- life is going to be more easy for them.



ROBERTS: So what's the number one issue for you in this one?



HACKETT: The number one issue for me is, more or less, health care. You know, for everyone, that's not being able to afford and everything.



ROBERTS: Have you really looked into the differences between the two plans? As we've been saying this morning, there's not that great of difference.



HACKETT: There's not that great of difference but -- you know, we've seen who is going to stand out. You know, who is going to make it stick. You know, what I mean? Who is going to just really, really just make it known to bring to existence, other than talk about it, but make it realistic.



ROBERTS: And do you think -- is that based on experience that she has?



HACKETT: More to say, yes. Yes. I have seen she's more -- you know, sticking around the people to understand and get to know them more better. Stand beside them.



ROBERTS: You know, when we were in California all the way across the country, last week, one of the big issues for people was electability. Who can actually win the White House? Who do you think has the edge on that front?



HACKETT: I would say, Hillary. She's pretty much got it like, you know, hand packed because the more or less, I more saw her face more than I did Obama because -- I mean, I didn't know of him until he just came to run for president. You know, other than that, I was like, I didn't know him at all. ROBERTS: Obviously, she's been around for awhile. Interesting too, though, we should note that the latest polls have got Obama leading by a substantial margin here in Georgia. So if you want Hillary to win, I guess you better get out there and cast your vote.



Trina Hackett, thanks very much for being with us. It's great to see you. Appreciate it. Get out there and vote today.



HACKETT: Yes, sir.



ROBERTS: So California, across the country again. The big prize in this Super Tuesday on the west coast. What are voters there thinking? We take a cross-country trip coming up to show you.



And the mortgage crisis. We've heard some of the candidates talking about it. What are their plans to fix the situation?



Gerri Willis will be here to tell us all about that, coming up on AMERICAN MORNING.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



ROBERTS: Many of the states voting today are states that had been hit hard in the foreclosure crisis. We have been looking at the candidates' plans to fix it. And CNN's Gerri Willis in a hard-hit neighborhood of Atlanta this morning.



Gerri, what are you finding there?



GERRI WILLIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, hey there, John. Yes, I'm in an Atlanta neighborhood where the foreclosures are highest. This zip code has the highest number of foreclosures in this city. Check out this house right behind me. It's bank-owned as you can see. Now, John, this is a largely working class community, if you can take a look at down the street here. Of the 85 homes on this street alone, some 24 are in foreclosure or have been in foreclosure.



Now, the neighborhood leaders are trying to take back the community. They say much of the problem here has been the result of mortgage fraud. And John, as you've been saying all morning, of course, what's going on here is going on across the country in Super Tuesday states all over the country. No place has been hit harder than California where 1 in 52 homes is in foreclosure. Big number there. And they've lost as much as $61 billion in values in homes but also tax revenues. Lost tax revenues.



As you know, the industry provides incredible tax revenues for local governments. Other states affected here as well. You can see Colorado. We've mentioned Georgia, Arizona and Illinois.



John?



ROBERTS: All right. So we know how the scope of the problem here, Gerri, because you've been doing some great reporting on it. But what are the candidates planning to try to do to fix it? WILLIS: Well, the person who's probably been most outspoken on the mortgage meltdown is probably Hillary Clinton. She came out with legislation last year to try to clean up the problem. She wanted the big bailout, actually, to solve the issue. Here's what she said recently about what should be done.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



CLINTON: I want a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days so we can try to work out keeping people in their homes instead of having them lose their homes. And I want to freeze interest rates for five years.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



WILLIS: Freeze interest rates so the people could actually work their way out of these adjustable rate mortgages which have been so difficult for folks.



Also, Obama, has also been outspoken on this topic, also introduced legislation. He wants a $10 billion bailout for the issue and he also wants to make sure that people get mortgage tax credits whether they itemize or not.



Now the Republicans have been very insistent on no government. They bailout of the folks in this crisis. They think private sector solutions are the best. One little bit difference there, one change, John McCain has opened the window to some possible Federal government involvement, if the issue isn't solved by the president's current plans that are working their way through communities all across the country.



John?



ROBERTS: All right, Gerri Willis for us this morning. Gerri, thanks very much. Now back to Harlem and here's Kiran.



CHETRY: You know, there were nearly 16 million registered voters in California. What's most important to them as they choose a candidate this morning? We're on the road, taking a road trip to find out.



Also, Kevin Everett, the Buffalo Bills player defied the odds in his recovery from what was describes as a catastrophic collision on the field. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is taking a closer look at the medical milestones that Kevin's made.



Hey, Sanjay.



DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Kiran. A spinal cord injury is what he had. A lot of people have heard of that. But why do some people get to walk away when so many others don't. I'll break it down for you and tell you what help Kevin. AMERICAN MORNING is coming right back.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: We're back from the Atlanta Diner this morning in Atlanta, Georgia. A big Super Tuesday state. This is the big prize in the south. 87 Democratic delegates available. 72 on the Republican side. And people came in this morning for some eggs and grits and headed out to cast their vote. Welcome back to AMERICAN MORNING. February 5th, Super Tuesday. I'm John Roberts in Atlanta.



Good morning, Kiran.



CHETRY: Hey, good to see you, John. We're here at the Adam Clayton Powell School in Harlem, New York. Of course, New York another huge state on this Super Tuesday. Hundreds of delegates up for grabs, especially on the Democratic side. We've seen people trickling in and out of here 2 1/2 hours ago, is when the polls opened. It's going to be a busy day not only here but at polling sites across the nation because it is Super Tuesday.



And it's as close as we'll come to a national primary. There are 24 states up for grabs today. 1,020 delegates for the Republicans and 1,681 delegates available for the Democrats. There's a look at the big picture map. People are already starting to line up across the northeast. Let's take a look at some of the places. How about West Hartford, Connecticut, Fort Lee, New Jersey, and also across the river from here in queens. We'll be checking back with voters as well as our reporters who have you covered from coast to coast this morning.



Getting back to New Jersey now. Polls have been open there for about 2 1/2 hours as well. There are 52 delegates at stake for republicans in New Jersey. 127 for democrats and the race is special. Independent voters are allowed to cast ballots. For example, here in New York, they cannot. The closed primaries in New York state. The candidates are aiming for some of those independents. Jason Carroll is at a polling station in Ft. Lee, New Jersey, to break it down for us this morning. Hi, Jason.



JASON CARROLL, CNN, CORRESPONDENT: And hello to you, Kiran. You know, if you are an independent and you show up here at a fire station like this, which is a polling place, that's why you hear the alarms going off. It is a working fire station, Kiran. But it is a polling place. But if you are an independent that shows up here, you have to declare either democrat or republican before you can cast your vote. The democratic race here much too close to call. Senator Barack Obama campaigned in east Rutherford yesterday where he was joined by Senator Edward Kennedy. It's the second major rally that he has attended in northern New Jersey within the past month.



Senator Clinton supporters say that she has a slight lead here in the state. Even so, she dispatched Chelsea Clinton out to do some campaigning for her on the republican side. Senator John McCain has a double-digit lead over Romney in the state but McCain still stopping through Trenton yesterday to do some last-minute campaigning. Romney sending out his son to do campaigning in the state as well. As you know, Kiran, New Jersey actually moved its primary up so they could have more impact on the presidential nominee. We spoke to some voters this morning about how that's impacting them.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's kind of sad when years past when you feel like your vote doesn't count.



UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, it's a different year than usual. There are a lot of choices. And it seems that it would really make a difference.



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's a lot of issues domestically we have to take care of. So with that, I think it makes it more important than ever.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARROLL: And Kiran, we took our own informal poll about the top issues facing some of the voters here in New Jersey. The top two issues they said - number one, the economy; number two, the need for change. Kiran.



CHETRY: Jason Carroll in Ft. Lee, New Jersey, this morning. Thank you.



Hillary Clinton, by the way, already cast her vote this morning. Hillary and Bill Clinton voted just minutes ago in Westchester county, the hometown of Chappaqua, about 30 miles north of us here in Harlem. Earlier on AMERICAN MORNING, I talked to her about some of the problems with the economy and asked what she would do to fix them.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



CHETRY: Another huge issue for people and that's the economy, recession. Some people argue we're already in one. Others say we need to pass some sort of stimulus plan and quickly to avoid one if that's the case. Right now, the House has a version. You're going to be heading back to Washington to vote on a Senate version. And meanwhile, there is talk that perhaps the longer this takes, the less effective it is. What would you do right now to try to stem the economic troubles we seem to be getting into?



CLINTON: Well, I would have a very aggressive policy toward trying to stop home foreclosures. Again, I'm the only candidate left in this race on either side who has been talking about the mortgage crisis for nearly a year. We need to put a moratorium on foreclosures to help people stay in their homes and we need to freeze these interest rates that continue to escalate, driving more and more people into foreclosure. A lot of people were misled. They were the victim of predatory lending practices, and we need to stabilize the housing market.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CHETRY: Senator Clinton also said she thinks the country is on the brink of a recession. And the Senate must get a stimulus plan through as a first step. John.



ROBERTS: Coming up on 34 minutes after the hour, Kiran, Senator Barack Obama is heading back to his hometown of Chicago for a rally tonight. We had a chance to speak with him in the last hour of AMERICAN MORNING, talk about issues like Iraq and the difference between his health care plan and Senator Clinton's.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



ROBERTS: She suggests you are falling short here by mandating coverage for children but not mandating it for their parents. What do you say?



SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let's break down what she really means by a mandate. What's meant by a mandate is that the government is forcing people to buy health insurance and so she's suggesting a parent is not going to buy health insurance for themselves if they can afford it. Now, my belief is that most parents will choose to get health care for themselves and we make it affordable.



ROBERTS: In an Obama White House, what would that strategic relationship with Iraq look like?



OBAMA: I think, first of all, it will not have us setting up permanent bases and a permanent occupation in Iraq for decades which is what George Bush's suggested but also John McCain. I think it is important for us to say to the Iraqis that we are willing to help them. We want to be partners with them, but we are not going to be there in perpetuity. And I have been very clear. I will end this war. We will get combat troops out. I hope to do it by the end of 2009.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



ROBERTS: Senator Obama also refused to say whether he'd join a combined ticket with Hillary Clinton. He said his focus now is winning the nomination and then trying to unite the country.



Well, California is a big piece of the puzzle today. Polls opened at 7:00 Pacific, 10 a.m. Eastern and the republicans going after 170 delegates for the democrats' 370 are at stake. And there is no winner take all. Delegates will be awarded by congressional district making it a lot more -- making it more like a lot of mini elections instead of just one big one. So what issues are driving the voters? Our Chris Lawrence hit the road to find out. He is live for us this morning in San Francisco. Chris, good morning.



CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN, CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, John. You know, 1 out of every 8 Americans lives in California. That gives you an idea of the sheer size of this primary. And the voters here are making their decisions based on immigration, health care and most of all, the economy.



(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)



LAWRENCE (voice-over): 80 miles east of L.A., Betty Larkins is packing up. After the bank foreclosed on her home.



BETTY LARKINS: People are saying something about a recession might come. To me, we're in one.



LAWRENCE: Betty beat cancer, but she's losing her home because she went broke paying hospital bills.



LARKINS: See, I didn't even know what it cost for a mammogram until I didn't have insurance.



LAWRENCE: Based on her health care plans, she's narrowed it down to Obama and Clinton.



LARKINGS: But I have to pray about it a lot before I make my decision.



LAWRENCE: Betty is just one member of the country's most diverse electorate. And California is super Tuesday's biggest prize. There are more people living in Los Angeles county than the entire state of Michigan. We wanted to hear from even more of California's nearly 16 million registered voters, and they are spread out all over the state.



Driving hundreds of miles to the more agricultural area around Fresno, we found problems for one front-runner.



JOE MENDOZA, UNDECIDED VOTER: McCain is wishy washy.



LAWRENCE: Joe Mendoza hasn't decided which other republican he'll vote for.



MENDOZA: Immigration is a big factor with me right now. To see what they are going to do. This country can't keep sending all our jobs off.



LAWRENCE: The next day, we're back on the road to the Bay Area where all that Clinton-Obama advertising has some new company.



For the first time, the GOP is awarding delegates to the winner in each congressional district. So republican candidates are campaigning in heavily democratic areas like San Francisco because even a small number there could deliver a win.



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You feel like you are more part of the process.



LAWRENCE: This registered republican is voting for Mitt Romney.



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think Iraq is going to take care of itself with the surge. It's working. But I care about people who are going to actually create jobs. Keep taxes down so that companies can grow.



(END VIDEOTAPE)



LAWRENCE: Yes, one thing about California, a lot of the voters, in fact perhaps half of the voters will vote by absentee ballots. A lot of us who live here, our friends and our family, have already voted. With that in mind, two things to keep in mind today. Barack Obama's late surge and Mitt Romney's conservative challenge to John McCa"	0
433	"Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: The Past Versus the Future

Denver, CO | January 30, 2008



Thank you Caroline - for your introduction, your support, and your lifetime of service to a grateful nation. You continue to inspire Americans of all ages and walks of life.

Let me also say a few words about another American who has called us to a common purpose. John Edwards has spent a lifetime fighting to give voice to the voiceless and hope to the struggling. At a time when our politics is too focused on who's up and who's down, he made us focus on who matters - the New Orleans child without a home, the West Virginia miner without a job, the families who live in that other America that is not seen or heard or talked about in Washington. John and Elizabeth Edwards believe deeply that two Americans can become one. Their campaign may have ended, but this cause lives on for all of us who believe that we can achieve one America.

Seven months from now, the Democratic Party will gather here in Denver to nominate our candidate for President of the United States.

We will come together after a long and hard fought primary campaign - and that's a good thing. Because it is through campaigns that we hear directly from the American people, set our common goals, and debate our differences. It is through campaigns that we bring new people into the process; build new coalitions; and renew who we are and what we stand for as a Party.

It is fitting that the journey leads to Denver - a city that is younger than the Democratic Party itself, but filled with the promise that our Party has always fought for. This city, built at the base of the Rocky Mountains, stands as a monument to a uniquely American belief in things unseen. Here, in Denver, fur trappers and traders; gold rushers and ranchers; came in search of opportunity, and made the future their own.

The story of America leads west. It is a story of ideals that know no boundaries. It is a story of immigrants who set out from distant shores; pioneers who persevered; and people of all races, religions, and ethnic groups who put aside their doubts to seek a new frontier.

My own family's journey moved west - from Kansas, where my grandparents met and married, and my mother was born; to the Pacific Coast after World War II; and then across an ocean to Hawaii. Their journey - like so many others - speaks to a simple truth written into the story of America. It's a truth at the foundation of the Democratic Party's purpose, Denver's progress, and our nation's promise: in America, the future is what we decide it's going to be.

As candidates, we must give new meaning to that promise. And seven months from now, one of us will stand before that convention hall, and give voice to the hopes, and dreams, and determination of Americans all across our country. In six days, you get to choose who will be that voice. You get to choose who will be able to build a new majority of not just Democrats - but Independents and Republicans - to win in November, and transform our country. And if you put your trust in me, I will stand up at that convention and say that our divisions are past, our hope is the future, and our time for change has come.

Now there is one thing we know for certain about the election in November: the name George Bush will not be on the ballot. The name of my cousin - Dick Cheney - will not be on the ballot. But the choice before you is about what comes next. Because we need to do more than turn the page on the failed Bush-Cheney policies; we have to turn the page on the politics that helped make those policies possible.

Lobbyists setting an agenda in Washington that feeds the inequality, insecurity, and instability in our economy.

Division and distraction that keeps us from coming together to deal with challenges like health care, and clean energy, and crumbling schools year after year after year.

Cronyism that gave us Katrina instead of competent government. And secrecy that made torture permissible and illegal wiretaps possible.

It's a politics that uses 9/11 to scare up votes; and fear and falsehoods to lead us into a war in Iraq that should've never been authorized and should've never been waged.

Each candidate running for the Democratic nomination shares an abiding desire to end the disastrous policies of the current administration. But we must decide - in the debate that leads to Denver - just what kind of Party we want to be, and what lessons we've learned from the bitter partisanship of the last two decades. We can be a Party that tries to beat the other side by practicing the same do-anything, say-anything, divisive politics that has stood in the way of progress; or we can be a Party that puts an end to it.

I am running for President because I believe that we need fundamental change in America. Not just a change of Party in the White House, but change in Washington that the American people can believe in - unity instead of division; hope instead of fear; a politics that leaves behind the fights of the past so that we can finally take hold of our future.

We began this campaign one year ago on the steps of the old statehouse in Springfield. At the time, we made a bet on the American people. That bet was simple - we weren't going to change anything by relying on the same Washington games; instead, we were betting on the American people's hunger for change, and your ability to make change happen from the bottom-up.

And we are showing America what change looks like. From the snows of Iowa to the sunshine of South Carolina, we have built a movement of young and old; rich and poor; black and white; Latino, Asian and Native American. We've reached Americans of all political stripes who are more interested in turning the page than turning up the heat on our opponents. That's how Democrats will win in November and build a majority in Congress. Not by nominating a candidate who will unite the other party against us, but by choosing one who can unite this country around a movement for change.

If you choose change, you will have a nominee who doesn't take a dime from Washington lobbyists and PACs. We don't need a candidate who agrees with Republicans that lobbyists are part of the system in Washington. They're part of the problem. And when I'm President, their days of setting the agenda in Washington will be over.

If you choose change, you will have a nominee who doesn't just tell people what they want to hear. Poll-tested positions and calculated answers might be how Washington confronts challenges, but it's not how you overcome them; it's not how you inspire our nation to come together behind a common purpose; and it's not what America needs right now.

If you choose change, you will have a nominee who isn't just playing on the same electoral map where half the country starts out against us, because you will have a nominee who has already brought in more Independents and Republicans; young people and new voters; than we have seen in a generation.

I know it is tempting - after another presidency by a man named George Bush - to simply turn back the clock, and to build a bridge back to the 20th Century. There are those will tell us that our Party should nominate someone who is more practiced in the art of pursuing power; that's it's not yet our turn or our time. There was also a time when Caroline Kennedy's father was counseled by a former President to Ã¢ÂÂbe patient,Ã¢ÂÂ and to step aside for Ã¢ÂÂsomeone with greater experience.Ã¢ÂÂ But John F. Kennedy responded by saying, Ã¢ÂÂThe world is changing. The old ways will not doÃ¢ÂÂ¦It is time for a new generation of leadership.Ã¢ÂÂ

It is time for a new generation of leadership, because the old politics just won't do. I am running for President - right now - because I have met Americans all across this country who cannot afford to wait another day for change. That is why the real choice in this campaign is not between regions or religions or genders. It's not about rich versus poor; young versus old; and it is not about black versus white.

It is about the past versus the future. And when I am the nominee, the Republicans won't be able to make this election about the past because you will have already chosen the future.

It's time for new leadership for an economy where families are being forced to foreclose on their dreams, and workers have seen their pensions disappear.

In the short-term, we need what I have consistently called for - a stimulus plan that gives the American people a tax rebate, and that also extends relief to seniors and expands unemployment insurance. And in the long-term, we need to put the American Dream on a firmer foundation. We're not going to offer the American people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who voted to put the banks and big business ahead of hard-working Americans. I've been fighting for working people my entire public life. And when I am President, I'll make sure that CEOs can't dump your pension with one hand while they collect a bonus with the other. I'll pass bankruptcy laws that protect workers instead of banks. And I'll crack down on fraudulent mortgage lenders, and credit card companies that change your rates to push you further into debt.

It's time for new leadership for the Maytag worker who is now competing with his own teenage son for a $7 an-hour job at Walmart because the factory he gave his life to shut its doors.

We're not going to offer the American people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who argues year after year for trade that isn't fair, but calls for a time-out on trade when they run for President. I will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working Americans. I will stop giving the wealthiest Americans tax cuts that they don't need and didn't ask for, and restore fairness to our economy. I'll give a tax cut to working people; provide relief to homeowners; and eliminate the income tax for seniors making under $50,000 so they can retire with the dignity and security they have earned.

It's time for new leadership for the woman I met who can't get Medicaid to cover the needs of her sick child.

She can't afford to wait another four years or another fifteen years to get health care because we've put forward a nominee who can't bring Democrats and Republicans together to get things done. I know that the reason Americans don't have health care isn't because no one is forcing them to buy it - it's because they can't afford it. That's why my plan cuts costs by up to $2500 for a typical family, and makes health care available and affordable for every single American. That's the plan that I'll pass in my first term as President.

It is time for new leadership for children going to overcrowded schools in East L.A.; for the teacher I met who is working at Dunkin Donuts to make ends meet; for the young people who are ready to go to college but can't afford it.

When I'm President, we'll rally this country to the cause of world-class education. That means putting our kids on a pathway to success with universal, quality, affordable early childhood education. That means paying our teachers more, and making sure they're not just teaching to the test - but teaching art and music and literature. That means giving our young people an annual $4,000 tax credit for college tuition if they serve their community; and that means expanding AmeriCorps to 250,000 slots, and issuing a call to service for a new generation. But that also means calling on parents to do their part - to get off the couch, turn off the television, and read to our children. Because responsibility for education starts at home.

It's time for new leadership so that my daughters and your children don't grow up in a century where our economy is weighed down by our addiction to oil; our foreign policy is held hostage to the whims of dictators; and our planet passes a moment of no return.

When I'm President, we won't wait any longer to reduce emissions. When I called for higher fuel efficiency standards, I didn't do it in front of an environmental group in California or in Boulder - that would have been the easy thing to do. I did it in front of the automakers in Detroit. Now it was pretty quiet - I didn't get a lot of applause. But we need leadership that tells the American people not just what they want to hear, but what we need to know. That's what I'll do. We cannot wait to invest in the next generation of biofuels, and wind and solar. If President Kennedy could send us to the moon in less than a decade - then we can meet this great challenge our generation. We can set the goal of an 80% reduction in global emissions by 2050, and we can lead the world to confront the climate crisis.

And it's time for new leadership for the woman who told me that she hasn't been able to breathe since the day her nephew left for Iraq, and the soldier who doesn't know his own child because he's on his third or fourth tour of duty.

I will end the mentality that says the only way for Democrats to look tough on national security is by talking, acting and voting like George Bush Republicans. It's time to reject the counsel that says the American people would rather have someone who is strong and wrong than someone who is weak and right - it's time to say that we are the Party that is going to be strong and right.

It's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone who agreed with him on voting for the war in Iraq; who agreed with him by voting to give George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran; who agrees with him in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like; and who actually differed with him by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions when the politics of the moment changed.

We need to offer the American people a clear contrast on national security, and when I am the nominee of the Democratic Party, that's exactly what I will do. Talking tough and tallying up your years in Washington is no substitute for judgment, and courage, and clear plans. It's not enough to say you'll be ready from Day One - you have to be right from Day One.

I opposed this war in Iraq from the start, and I have never, ever wavered in that opposition. I warned about taking our eye off of Osama bin Laden, and overstretching our troops and their families as we have seen in communities across this country like Fort Carson. And when I am President, I will immediately begin to remove our troops, I will finally put meaningful pressure on Iraq's leaders to reconcile, and I will end this war. And I will do what we should have done back in 2002: increase our commitment to Afghanistan, press Pakistan to take action against terror, and finish the fight with al Qaeda.

I will challenge the conventional thinking that says we can't conduct diplomacy with leaders we don't like. Strong countries and strong Presidents talk to their adversaries as well as their friends, and that's what I'll do. And when I am President, we will keep nuclear weapons from terrorists by securing all loose nuclear materials around the world during my first term in office. We will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons, and we will pursue it.

It's time for new leadership that reaches out, as President Kennedy did to my own father, to people Ã¢ÂÂin the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery.Ã¢ÂÂ

It's time to restore our moral leadership by rejecting torture without equivocation; by closing Guantanamo; by restoring habeas corpus; and by again being that light of justice to dissidents in prison camps around the globe. It's time for America to lead the world against the common threats of the 21st century - terrorism and nuclear weapons, but also climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. I will send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, Ã¢ÂÂYou matter to us. Your future is our future. And our moment is now.Ã¢ÂÂ

This is what the moment demands of us - to cast off our doubts; to reach once more for what America can be if we have the courage to make the future our own.

We've been warned, in these last few weeks, that this kind of change isn't possible. That we're peddling false hopes. That we need a reality check.

And we've faced forces that are not the fault of any one campaign - forces that open American wounds. The politics that uses religion as a wedge, and patriotism as a bludgeon. A politics that tells us what we have to think and even vote within the confines of the categories that supposedly define us. The assumption that young people are apathetic. The assumption that Republicans won't cross over. The assumption that the wealthy care nothing for the poor, and that the poor don't vote. The assumption that African-Americans can't support the white candidate; whites can't support the African-American candidate; and blacks and Latinos can't come together.

But our Party - the Democratic Party - has always been at its best when we rose above these divisions; when we called all Americans to a common purpose, a higher purpose; when we stood up and said that we will write our own future, and the future will be what we want it to be.

We followed a King to the mountaintop, and a Kennedy who called on us to reject the mindless menace of violence.

We're the party of a young President who asked what we could do for our country, and who put us on a path to the moon.

We're the party of a man who overcame his own disability; who told us that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself; and who faced down fascism and liberated a continent from tyranny.

We're the party of Jackson, who took back the White House for the people of this country.

And we're the party of Jefferson, who wrote the words that we are still trying to heed - that all of us are created equal - and who sent us West to blaze new trails, to make new discoveries, and to realize the promise of our highest ideals.

That is who we are. That is the Party that we need to be, and can be, if we cast off our doubts, and leave behind our fears, and choose the America that we know is possible. Because there is a moment in the life of every generation, if it is to make its mark on history, when its spirit has to come through, when it must choose the future over the past, when it must make its own change from the bottom up.

This is our moment. This is our message - the same message we had when we were up, and when we were down. The same message that we will carry all the way to the convention. And in seven months time - right here in Denver - we can realize this promise; we can claim this legacy; we can choose new leadership for America. Because there is nothing we cannot do if the American people decide it is time."	0
434	"BREAKING: Malia Obama SUSPENDED After Racist Anti-White Attack Goes Viral

A few days ago, a student at Harvard leaked the contents of Malia ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs speech final. The topic? A World Without Whites. And now it may get Malia Obama suspended.

Ã¢ÂÂWhite people are so 1960Ã¢ÂÂs. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that they will be blended out by the time I am 30,Ã¢ÂÂ a recording of ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs speech shared on Snapchat said. Ã¢ÂÂImagine a world without white people.Ã¢ÂÂ Obama was of course referring to the scientific belief that if whites continue to breed at low rates in America while others races continue to breed at current rates, white babies will be virtually nonexistent in our country by 2038.

A post quoting Obama was shared more than 14,000 times with a reach of nearly 1 million Americans, which forced Harvard to take action.

Ã¢ÂÂThis sort of attack against any race is uncalled for,Ã¢ÂÂ Harvard Dean Cain Markholder said in a statement Sunday. Ã¢ÂÂMs. Obama has been informed she is suspended pending an investigation into her statement.Ã¢ÂÂ But it gets worse for Obama Ã¢ÂÂ Markholder says that if a disciplinary board finds her guilty, she will Ã¢ÂÂforfeit her grade for the examÃ¢ÂÂ which is worth 47% of her grade according to one of the students who shared video of her racist hate speech-filled attack on whites.

The dean notes that punishment for racist attacks like this can lead to Ã¢ÂÂexpulsion,Ã¢ÂÂ but weÃ¢ÂÂre sure that her dad will once again bail her out of trouble."	1
435	"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148)

Overall approach to expanding access to coverage Require most U.S. citizens and legal residents to have health insurance. Create state-based American Health Benefit Exchanges through which individuals can purchase coverage, with premium and cost-sharing credits available to individuals/families with income between 133-400% of the federal poverty level (the poverty level is $19,530 for a family of three in 2013) and create separate Exchanges through which small businesses can purchase coverage. Require employers to pay penalties for employees who receive tax credits for health insurance through an Exchange, with exceptions for small employers. Impose new regulations on health plans in the Exchanges and in the individual and small group markets. Expand Medicaid to 133% of the federal poverty level.

INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

Requirement to have coverage Require U.S. citizens and legal residents to have qualifying health coverage. Those without coverage pay a tax penalty of the greater of $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount ($2,085) per family or 2.5% of household income. The penalty will be phased-in according to the following schedule: $95 in 2014, $325 in 2015, and $695 in 2016 for the flat fee or 1.0% of taxable income in 2014, 2.0% of taxable income in 2015, and 2.5% of taxable income in 2016. Beginning after 2016, the penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment. Exemptions will be granted for financial hardship, religious objections, American Indians, those without coverage for less than three months, undocumented immigrants, incarcerated individuals, those for whom the lowest cost plan option exceeds 8% of an individualÃ¢ÂÂs income, and those with incomes below the tax filing threshold (in 2009 the threshold for taxpayers under age 65 was $9,350 for singles and $18,700 for couples).

EMPLOYER REQUIREMENTS

Requirement to offer coverage Assess employers with 50 or more full-time employees that do not offer coverage and have at least one full-time employee who receives a premium tax credit a fee of $2,000 per full-time employee, excluding the first 30 employees from the assessment. Employers with 50 or more full-time employees that offer coverage but have at least one full-time employee receiving a premium tax credit, will pay the lesser of $3,000 for each employee receiving a premium credit or $2,000 for each full-time employee, excluding the first 30 employees from the assessment. (Effective January 1, 2014) Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Exempt employers with up to 50 full-time employees from any of the above penalties.

Other requirements Require employers with more than 200 employees to automatically enroll employees into health insurance plans offered by the employer. Employees may opt out of coverage.

EXPANSION OF PUBLIC PROGRAMS

Treatment of Medicaid Expand Medicaid to all non-Medicare eligible individuals under age 65 (children, pregnant women, parents, and adults without dependent children) with incomes up to 133% FPL based on modified adjusted gross income (as under current law undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid). All newly eligible adults will be guaranteed a benchmark benefit package that meets the essential health benefits available through the Exchanges. The Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA upheld the Medicaid expansion, but limited the ability of HHS to enforce it, thereby making the decision to expand Medicaid optional for states. To finance the coverage for the newly eligible (those who were not previously eligible for at least benchmark equivalent coverage, those who were eligible for a capped program but were not enrolled, or those who were enrolled in state-funded programs), states will receive 100% federal funding for 2014 through 2016, 95% federal financing in 2017, 94% federal financing in 2018, 93% federal financing in 2019, and 90% federal financing for 2020 and subsequent years. States that have already expanded eligibility to adults with incomes up to 100% FPL will receive a phased-in increase in the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for non-pregnant childless adults so that by 2019 they receive the same federal financing as other states (93% in 2019 and 90% in 2020 and later). States have the option to expand Medicaid eligibility to childless adults beginning on April 1, 2010, but will receive their regular FMAP until 2014. In addition, increase Medicaid payments in fee-for-service and managed care for primary care services provided by primary care doctors (family medicine, general internal medicine or pediatric medicine) to 100% of the Medicare payment rates for 2013 and 2014. States will receive 100% federal financing for the increased payment rates. (Effective January 1, 2014)

Treatment of CHIP Require states to maintain current income eligibility levels for children in Medicaid and the ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Health Insurance Program (CHIP) until 2019 and extend funding for CHIP through 2015. CHIP benefit package and cost-sharing rules will continue as under current law. Provide states with the option to provide CHIP coverage to children of state employees who are eligible for health benefits if certain conditions are met. Beginning in 2015, states will receive a 23 percentage point increase in the CHIP match rate up to a cap of 100%. CHIP-eligible children who are unable to enroll in the program due to enrollment caps will be eligible for tax credits in the state Exchanges.

PREMIUM AND COST-SHARING SUBSIDIES TO INDIVIDUALS

Eligibility Limit availability of premium credits and cost-sharing subsidies through the Exchanges to U.S. citizens and legal immigrants who meet income limits. Employees who are offered coverage by an employer are not eligible for premium credits unless the employer plan does not have an actuarial value of at least 60% or if the employee share of the premium exceeds 9.5% of income. Legal immigrants who are barred from enrolling in Medicaid during their first five years in the U.S. will be eligible for premium credits.

Premium credits Provide refundable and advanceable premium credits to eligible individuals and families with incomes between 100-400% FPL to purchase insurance through the Exchanges. The premium credits will be tied to the second lowest cost silver plan in the area and will be set on a sliding scale such that the premium contributions are limited to the following percentages of income for specified income levels: Up to 133% FPL: 2% of income 133-150% FPL: 3 Ã¢ÂÂ 4% of income 150-200% FPL: 4 Ã¢ÂÂ 6.3% of income 200-250% FPL: 6.3 Ã¢ÂÂ 8.05% of income 250-300% FPL: 8.05 Ã¢ÂÂ 9.5% of income 300-400% FPL: 9.5% of income Increase the premium contributions for those receiving subsidies annually to reflect the excess of the premium growth over the rate of income growth for 2014-2018. Beginning in 2019, further adjust the premium contributions to reflect the excess of premium growth over CPI if aggregate premiums and cost sharing subsidies exceed .504% of GDP.

Provisions related to the premium and cost-sharing subsidies are effective January 1, 2014.

Cost-sharing subsidies Provide cost-sharing subsidies to eligible individuals and families. The cost-sharing credits reduce the cost-sharing amounts and annual cost-sharing limits and have the effect of increasing the actuarial value of the basic benefit plan to the following percentages of the full value of the plan for the specified income level:

100-150% FPL: 94%

150-200% FPL: 87%

200-250% FPL: 73%

250-400% FPL: 70%

Verification Require verification of both income and citizenship status in determining eligibility for the federal premium credits.

Subsidies and abortion coverage Ensure that federal premium or cost-sharing subsidies are not used to purchase coverage for abortion if coverage extends beyond saving the life of the woman or cases of rape or incest (Hyde amendment). If an individual who receives federal assistance purchases coverage in a plan that chooses to cover abortion services beyond those for which federal funds are permitted, those federal subsidy funds (for premiums or cost-sharing) must not be used for the purchase of the abortion coverage and must be segregated from private premium payments or state funds.

PREMIUM SUBSIDIES TO EMPLOYERS

Small business tax credits Provide small employers with no more than 25 employees and average annual wages of less than $50,000 that purchase health insurance for employees with a tax credit. Phase I: For tax years 2010 through 2013, provide a tax credit of up to 35% of the employerÃ¢ÂÂs contribution toward the employeeÃ¢ÂÂs health insurance premium if the employer contributes at least 50% of the total premium cost or 50% of a benchmark premium. The full credit will be available to employers with 10 or fewer employees and average annual wages of less than $25,000. The credit phases-out as firm size and average wage increases. Tax-exempt small businesses meeting these requirements are eligible for tax credits of up to 25% of the employerÃ¢ÂÂs contribution toward the employeeÃ¢ÂÂs health insurance premium. Phase II: For tax years 2014 and later, for eligible small businesses that purchase coverage through the state Exchange, provide a tax credit of up to 50% of the employerÃ¢ÂÂs contribution toward the employeeÃ¢ÂÂs health insurance premium if the employer contributes at least 50% of the total premium cost. The credit will be available for two years. The full credit will be available to employers with 10 or fewer employees and average annual wages of less than $25,000. The credit phases-out as firm size and average wage increases. Tax-exempt small businesses meeting these requirements are eligible for tax credits of up to 35% of the employerÃ¢ÂÂs contribution toward the employeeÃ¢ÂÂs health insurance premium.



Reinsurance program Create a temporary reinsurance program for employers providing health insurance coverage to retirees over age 55 who are not eligible for Medicare. Program will reimburse employers or insurers for 80% of retiree claims between $15,000 and $90,000. Payments from the reinsurance program will be used to lower the costs for enrollees in the employer plan. Appropriate $5 billion to finance the program. (Effective 90 days following enactment through January 1, 2014)

TAX CHANGES RELATED TO HEALTH INSURANCE OR FINANCING HEALTH REFORM

Tax changes related to health insurance Impose a tax on individuals without qualifying coverage of the greater of $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount or 2.5% of household income to be phased-in beginning in 2014.

Exclude the costs for over-the-counter drugs not prescribed by a doctor from being reimbursed through an HRA or health FSA and from being reimbursed on a tax-free basis through an HSA or Archer Medical Savings Account. (Effective January 1, 2011)

Increase the tax on distributions from a health savings account or an Archer MSA that are not used for qualified medical expenses to 20% (from 10% for HSAs and from 15% for Archer MSAs) of the disbursed amount. (Effective January 1, 2011)

Limit the amount of contributions to a flexible spending account for medical expenses to $2,500 per year increased annually by the cost of living adjustment. (Effective January 1, 2013)

Increase the threshold for the itemized deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses from 7.5% of adjusted gross income to 10% of adjusted gross income for regular tax purposes; waive the increase for individuals age 65 and older for tax years 2013 through 2016. (Effective January 1, 2013)

Increase the Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) tax rate on wages by 0.9% (from 1.45% to 2.35%) on earnings over $200,000 for individual taxpayers and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly and impose a 3.8% tax on unearned income for higher-income taxpayers (thresholds are not indexed). (Effective January 1, 2013)

Impose an excise tax on insurers of employer-sponsored health plans with aggregate values that exceed $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage (these threshold values will be indexed to the consumer price index for urban consumers (CPI-U) for years beginning in 2020). The threshold amounts will be increased for retired individuals age 55 and older who are not eligible for Medicare and for employees engaged in high-risk professions by $1,650 for individual coverage and $3,450 for family coverage. The threshold amounts may be adjusted upwards if health care costs rise more than expected prior to implementation of the tax in 2018. The threshold amounts will be increased for firms that may have higher health care costs because of the age or gender of their workers. The tax is equal to 40% of the value of the plan that exceeds the threshold amounts and is imposed on the issuer of the health insurance policy, which in the case of a self-insured plan is the plan administrator or, in some cases, the employer. The aggregate value of the health insurance plan includes reimbursements under a flexible spending account for medical expenses (health FSA) or health reimbursement arrangement (HRA), employer contributions to a health savings account (HSA), and coverage for supplementary health insurance coverage, excluding dental and vision coverage. (Effective January 1, 2018)

Eliminate the tax deduction for employers who receive Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy payments. (Effective January 1, 2013)

Tax changes related to financing health reform Impose new annual fees on the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector, according to the following schedule: $2.8 billion in 2012-2013;$3.0 billion in 2014-2016; $4.0 billion in 2017; $4.1 billion in 2018; and 2.8 billion in 2019 and later.

Impose an annual fee on the health insurance sector, according to the following schedule: $8 billion in 2014; $11.3 billion in 2015-2016; $13.9 billion in 2017; $14.3 billion in 2018 For subsequent years, the fee shall be the amount from the previous year increased by the rate of premium growth.

For non-profit insurers, only 50% of net premiums are taken into account in calculating the fee. Exemptions granted for non-profit plans that receive more than 80% of their income from government programs targeting low-income or elderly populations, or people with disabilities, and voluntary employeesÃ¢ÂÂ beneficiary associations (VEBAs) not established by an employer. (Effective January 1, 2014) Impose an excise tax of 2.3% on the sale of any taxable medical device. (Effective for sales after December 31, 2012)

Limit the deductibility of executive and employee compensation to $500,000 per applicable individual for health insurance providers. (Effective January 1, 2009)

Impose a tax of 10% on the amount paid for indoor tanning services. (Effective July 1, 2010)

Clarify application of the economic substance doctrine and increase penalties for underpayments attributable to a transaction lacking economic substance. (Effective upon enactment)

HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES

Creation and structure of health insurance exchanges Create state-based American Health Benefit Exchanges and Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Exchanges, administered by a governmental agency or non-profit organization, through which individuals and small businesses with up to 100 employees can purchase qualified coverage. Permit states to allow businesses with more than 100 employees to purchase coverage in the SHOP Exchange beginning in 2017. States may form regional Exchanges or allow more than one Exchange to operate in a state as long as each Exchange serves a distinct geographic area. (Funding available to states to establish Exchanges within one year of enactment and until January 1, 2015)

Eligibility to purchase in the exchanges Restrict access to coverage through the Exchanges to U.S. citizens and legal immigrants who are not incarcerated.

Multi-state plans Require the Office of Personnel Management to contract with insurers to offer at least two multi-state plans in each Exchange. At least one plan must be offered by a non-profit entity and at least one plan must not provide coverage for abortions beyond those permitted by federal law. Each multi-state plan must be licensed in each state and must meet the qualifications of a qualified health plan. If a state has lower age rating requirements than 3:1, the state may require multi-state plans to meet the more protective age rating rules. These multi-state plans will be offered separately from the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program and will have a separate risk pool.

Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) Create the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program to foster the creation of non-profit, member-run health insurance companies in all 50 states and District of Columbia to offer qualified health plans. To be eligible to receive funds, an organization must not be an existing health insurer or sponsored by a state or local government, substantially all of its activities must consist of the issuance of qualified health benefit plans in each state in which it is licensed, governance of the organization must be subject to a majority vote of its members, must operate with a strong consumer focus, and any profits must be used to lower premiums, improve benefits, or improve the quality of health care delivered to its members. (Appropriate $4.8 billion to finance the program and award loans and grants to establish CO-OPs by July 1, 2013)

Benefit tiers Create four benefit categories of plans plus a separate catastrophic plan to be offered through the Exchange, and in the individual and small group markets: Bronze plan represents minimum creditable coverage and provides the essential health benefits, cover 60% of the benefit costs of the plan, with an out-of-pocket limit equal to the Health Savings Account (HSA) current law limit ($5,950 for individuals and $11,900 for families in 2010); Silver plan provides the essential health benefits, covers 70% of the benefit costs of the plan, with the HSA out-of-pocket limits; Gold plan provides the essential health benefits, covers 80% of the benefit costs of the plan, with the HSA out-of-pocket limits; Platinum plan provides the essential health benefits, covers 90% of the benefit costs of the plan, with the HSA out-of-pocket limits; Catastrophic plan available to those up to age 30 or to those who are exempt from the mandate to purchase coverage and provides catastrophic coverage only with the coverage level set at the HSA current law levels except that prevention benefits and coverage for three primary care visits would be exempt from the deductible. This plan is only available in the individual market.

Reduce the out-of-pocket limits for those with incomes up to 400% FPL to the following levels: 100-200% FPL: one-third of the HSA limits ($1,983/individual and $3,967/family); 200-300% FPL: one-half of the HSA limits ($2,975/individual and $5,950/family); 300-400% FPL: two-thirds of the HSA limits ($3,987/individual and $7,973/family).

These out-of-pocket reductions are applied within the actuarial limits of the plan and will not increase the actuarial value of the plan.

Insurance market and rating rules Require guarantee issue and renewability and allow rating variation based only on age (limited to 3 to 1 ratio), premium rating area, family composition, and tobacco use (limited to 1.5. to 1 ratio) in the individual and the small group market and the Exchange.

Require risk adjustment in the individual and small group markets and in the Exchange. (Effective January 1, 2014)

Qualifications of participating health plans Require qualified health plans participating in the Exchange to meet marketing requirements, have adequate provider networks, contract with essential community providers, contract with navigators to conduct outreach and enrollment assistance, be accredited with respect to performance on quality measures, use a uniform enrollment form and standard format to present plan information.

Require qualified health plans to report information on claims payment policies, enrollment, disenrollment, number of claims denied, cost-sharing requirements, out-of-network policies, and enrollee rights in plain language.

Requirements of the exchanges Require the Exchanges to maintain a call center for customer service, and establish procedures for enrolling individuals and businesses and for determining eligibility for tax credits. Require states to develop a single form for applying for state health subsidy programs that can be filed online, in person, by mail or by phone. Permit Exchanges to contract with state Medicaid agencies to determine eligibility for tax credits in the Exchanges.

Require Exchanges to submit financial reports to the Secretary and comply with oversight investigations including a GAO study on the operation and administration of Exchanges.

Basic health plan Permit states the option to create a Basic Health Plan for uninsured individuals with incomes between 133-200% FPL who would otherwise be eligible to receive premium subsidies in the Exchange. States opting to provide this coverage will contract with one or more standard plans to provide at least the essential health benefits and must ensure that eligible individuals do not pay more in premiums than they would have paid in the Exchange and that the cost-sharing requirements do not exceed those of the platinum plan for enrollees with income less than 150% FPL or the gold plan for all other enrollees. States will receive 95% of the funds that would have been paid as federal premium and cost-sharing subsidies for eligible individuals to establish the Basic Health Plan. Individuals with incomes between 133-200% FPL in states creating Basic Health Plans will not be eligible for subsidies in the Exchanges.

Abortion coverage Permit states to prohibit plans participating in the Exchange from providing coverage for abortions.

Require plans that choose to offer coverage for abortions beyond those for which federal funds are permitted (to save the life of the woman and in cases of rape or incest) in states that allow such coverage to create allocation accounts for segregating premium payments for coverage of abortion services from premium payments for coverage for all other services to ensure that no federal premium or cost-sharing subsidies are used to pay for the abortion coverage. Plans must also estimate the actuarial value of covering abortions by taking into account the cost of the abortion benefit (valued at no less than $1 per enrollee per month) and cannot take into account any savings that might be reaped as a result of the abortions. Prohibit plans participating in the Exchanges from discriminating against any provider because of an unwillingness to provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.

Effective dates Unless otherwise noted, provisions relating to the American Health Benefit Exchanges are effective January 1, 2014.

BENEFIT DESIGN

Essential benefits package Create an essential health benefits package that provides a comprehensive set of services, covers at least 60% of the actuarial value of the covered benefits, limits annual cost-sharing to the current law HSA limits ($5,950/individual and $11,900/family in 2010), and is not more extensive than the typical employer plan. Require the Secretary to define and annually update the benefit package through a transparent and public process. (Effective January 1, 2014)

Require all qualified health benefits plans, including those offered through the Exchanges and those offered in the individual and small group markets outside the Exchanges, except grandfathered individual and employer-sponsored plans, to offer at least the essential health benefits package.

U.S. citizens and legal immigrants who have a pre-existing medical condition and who have been uninsured for at least six months will be eligible to enroll in the high-risk pool and receive subsidized premiums. Premiums for the pool will be established for a standard population and may vary by no more than 4 to 1 due to age; maximum cost-sharing will be limited to the current law HSA limit ($5,950/individual and $11,900/family in 2010). Appropriate $5 billion to finance the program. (Effective within 90 days of enactment until January 1, 2014)

Medical loss ratio and premium rate reviews Require health plans to report the proportion of premium dollars spent on clinical services, quality, and other costs and provide rebates to consumers for the amount of the premium spent on clinical services and quality that is less than 85% for plans in the large group market and 80% for plans in the individual and small group markets. (Requirement to report medical loss ratio effective plan year 2010; requirement to provide rebates effective January 1, 2011)

Establish a process for reviewing increases in health plan premiums and require plans to justify increases. Require states to report on trends in premium increases and recommend whether certain plan should be excluded from the Exchange based on unjustified premium increases. Provide grants to states to support efforts to review and approve premium increases. (Effective beginning plan year 2010)

Administrative simplification Adopt standards for financial and administrative transactions to promote administrative simplification. (Effective dates vary)

Dependent coverage Provide dependent coverage for children up to age 26 for all individual and group policies. (Effective six months following enactment)

Prohibit pre-existing condition exclusions for children. (Effective six months following enactment) Beginning in January 2014, prohibit individual and group health plans from placing annual limits on the dollar value of coverage. Prior to January 2014, plans may only impose annual limits on coverage as determined by the Secretary.

Grandfather existing individual and group plans with respect to new benefit standards, but require these grandfathered plans to extend dependent coverage to adult children up to age 26 and prohibit rescissions of coverage. Require grandfathered group plans to eliminate lifetime limits on coverage and beginning in 2014, eliminate annual limits on coverage. Prior to 2014, grandfathered group plans may only impose annual limits as determined by the Secretary. Require grandfathered group plans to eliminate pre-existing condition exclusions for children within six months of enactment and by 2014 for adults, and eliminate waiting periods for coverage of greater than 90 days by 2014. (Effective six months following enactment, except where otherwise specified)

Require all new policies (except stand-alone dental, vision, and long-term care insurance plans), including those offered through the Exchanges and those offered outside of the Exchanges, to comply with one of the four benefit categories. Existing individual and employer-sponsored plans do not have to meet the new benefit standards. (See description of benefit categories in Creation of insurance pooling mechanism.) (Effective January 1, 2014)

Limit deductibles for health plans in the small group market to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for families unless contributions are offered that offset deductible amounts above these limits. This deductible limit will not affect the actuarial value of any plans. (Effective January 1, 2014)

Limit any waiting periods for coverage to 90 days. (Effective January 1, 2014)

Create a temporary reinsurance program to collect payments from health insurers in the individual and group markets to provide payments to plans in the individual market that cover high-risk individuals. Finance the reinsurance program through mandatory contributions by health insurers totaling $25 billion over three years. (Effective January 1, 2014 through December 2016)

Allow states the option of merging the individual and small group markets. (Effective January 1, 2014)

Health care choice compacts and national plans Permit states to form health care choice compacts and allow insurers to sell policies in any state participating in the compact. Insurers selling policies through a compact would only be subject to the laws and regulations of the state where the policy is written or issued, except for rules pertaining to market conduct, unfair trade practices, network adequacy, and consumer protections. Compacts may only be approved if it is determined that the compact will provide coverage that is at least as comprehensive and affordable as coverage provided through the state Exchanges. (Regulations issued by July 1, 2013, compacts may not take effect before January 1, 2016)

Health insurance administration Establish the Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund within the Department of Health and Human Services and allocate $1 billion to implement health reform policies.

Enroll newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries into the Medicaid program no later than January 2014 (states have the option to expand enrollment beginning in 2011), coordinate enrollment with the new Exchanges, and implement other specified changes to the Medicaid program. Maintain current Medicaid and CHIP eligibility levels for children until 2019 and maintain current Medicaid eligibility levels for adults until the Exchange is fully operational. A state will be exempt from the maintenance of effort requirement for non-disabled adults with incomes above 133% FPL for any year from January 2011 through December 31, 2013 if the state certifies that it is experiencing a budget deficit or will experience a deficit in the following year.

Establish an office of health insurance consumer assistance or an ombudsman program to serve as an advocate for people with private coverage in the individual and small group markets. (Federal grants available beginning fiscal year 2010)

Permit states to create a Basic Health Plan for uninsured individuals with incomes between 133% and 200% FPL in lieu of these individuals receiving premium subsidies to purchase coverage in the Exchanges. (Effective January 1, 2014) Permit states to obtain a five-year waiver of certain new health insurance requirements if the state can demonstrate that it provides health coverage to all residents that is at least as comprehensive as the coverage required under an Exchange plan and that the state plan does not increase the federal budget deficit. (Effective January 1, 2017)

COST CONTAINMENT

Administrative simplification Simplify health insurance administration by adopting a single set of operating rules for eligibility verification and claims status (rules adopted July 1, 2011; effective January 1, 2013), electronic funds transfers and health care payment and remittance (rules adopted "	0
436	"As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut.

""One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues,"" CNNÃ¢ÂÂs Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin OÃ¢ÂÂMalley group.

""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods,"" said the attack, which first aired June 25. ""Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.""

SandersÃ¢ÂÂ record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (""Bernie Sanders, gun nut"") as well as conservative glee (""Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut""). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.

The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.)

But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didnÃ¢ÂÂt muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didnÃ¢ÂÂt exist at the time).

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.

According to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, SandersÃ¢ÂÂ reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job.

""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Weaver said. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.""

In April 1991, SandersÃ¢ÂÂ then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.

""BernieÃ¢ÂÂs response is that he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,"" Pollina said. ""ItÃ¢ÂÂs not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.""

The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and SandersÃ¢ÂÂ own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.

""As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,"" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. ""He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituentsÃ¢ÂÂ preferences so does not make gun control a priority.""

""I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line Ã¢ÂÂ and angering both sides through the years,"" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. ""Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians.""

Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to SandersÃ¢ÂÂ 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half.

Here are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position):

SandersÃ¢ÂÂ moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike. Former NRA research coordinator Paul Blackman says the group doesnÃ¢ÂÂt consider Sanders ""an anti-gunner,"" and heÃ¢ÂÂs received mixed marks from NRA ranging from a C- to F. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isnÃ¢ÂÂt a ""gun lobby lapdog.""

Experts agreed that on guns, SandersÃ¢ÂÂ views are to the right of his Democratic rivals.

""When it comes to guns, heÃ¢ÂÂs not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin OÃ¢ÂÂMalley or Hillary Clinton,"" said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College. ""Guns are not an important issue for him, because they donÃ¢ÂÂt fit into the class-based framework that Bernie looks at politics through.""

Our ruling

An attack ad said, ""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods.""

The Brady bill imposed a five-day waiting period for would-be purchasers of handguns. Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He did, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background checks.

Experts noted SandersÃ¢ÂÂ votes were representative of VermontÃ¢ÂÂs gun owners and gun laws. Since the 1990s, his record on gun control is mixed.

437	"CNBC reported that Trump has substantial investments in the companies involved with the construction of the pipeline. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it.

Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs business investments spread throughout the world. Now, we know that he has ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the one that crosses sacred Indian land.

The construction of the pipeline raised the ire of Native American Sioux settlements in the area. It will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply.

The pipeline is also a threat to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. In addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country.

Opposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. The protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them.

The opposition brought out many supporters, too. On November 15, 2016, there was a National Day of Action to protest the construction. There were massive protests in cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs own Manhattan in support of the Sioux Nation.

Veterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. American heroes supporting Native American heroes.

And now we learn that Ã¢ÂÂPresidentÃ¢ÂÂ Trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. No wonder the Orange Fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president.

This should come as no surprise since Trump Ã¢ÂÂs financial ties are everywhere. Almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president.

This involvement is another example of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president. And here it is, another unconstitutional violation.

According to Ethics experts, TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate. As with other presidents, he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust.

The blind trust would prohibit Trump from any involvement. As he wants it, his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly, and he would surely lie about it.

The Dakota Pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by Trump, but perhaps the most controversial. If only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs support of the cruel actions of the police.

We must insist that the media tell this story. With its broadcast, the public will see how Trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment.

439	"The labor market is the foundation of income for nearly all working-age families, so when the labor market deteriorates, household income drops.

As the figure shows, income for the median working-age household Ã¢ÂÂ where the householder is under 65 Ã¢ÂÂ dropped by $4,184 between 2007 and 2010. Furthermore, the Great Recession came on the heels of one of the worst business cycles (2000-2007) on record in terms of job creation, one in which the income of the median working-age household fell $2,113.

Thus, the typical working-age household brought in roughly $6,300 less in 2010 than it did in 2000, a more than 10 percent decline. A lost decade, indeed.

Colorado Springs, Colorado

1:58 P.M. MDT

THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Colorado! (Applause.) Oh, what a beautiful day! (Applause.)

Can everybody please give Christy a big round of applause for the great introduction? (Applause.) And then, I want everybody to acknowledge one of the outstanding alums of Colorado College -- (applause) -- an outstanding senator for this great state of Colorado, an unbelievable Secretary of the Interior, looking after our natural resources -- Ken Salazar. (Applause.)

Now --

AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!

THE PRESIDENT: I love you back. I really do. (Applause.)

Now, I have to say, first of all, this looks like a very smart crowd -- (applause) -- which means that you've been spending a lot of time watching our Olympic Games -- (applause) -- and the unbelievable athletes and all the great training -- right here, we've got -- do we have one of our outstanding athletes? (Applause.) Thank you, Colorado, because Colorado Springs has been a training site for all our outstanding athletes. And we're so proud of them. Thank you so much. (Applause.)

And for those of you who are curious, the women are doing pretty good right now in soccer. (Applause.) I know some of you may be -- the game is not over, and some of you may have DVR'd it, so I'm not going to say anything more. (Laughter.) But we're making progress.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Moving forward!

THE PRESIDENT: Moving forward. (Applause.)

Now, even though we've been spending most of our time, sensibly, watching the Olympics, unless your cable is broken, you probably also noticed thereÃ¢ÂÂs this pretty intense campaign going on right now. And the reason it is an intense campaign is because the choice that we face in November could not be bigger. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties. It is a choice between two fundamentally different visions about how we move this country forward. And the direction that we choose -- the direction you choose when you walk into that voting booth -- is going to have a direct impact not just on us, it will have an impact on our kids and our grandkids for decades to come.

Now, four years ago, we came together -- and it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt just Democrats, we had independents and even some Republicans come together because we wanted to restore the basic bargain that made this country great, that built the greatest middle class and the most prosperous economy in the history of the world. And itÃ¢ÂÂs a bargain that says very simply, if you work hard, your work will be rewarded. If you work hard, you can get ahead. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a deal that says if you put in enough effort, if you act responsibly, you can find a job that pays the bills, have a home you call your own. You can count on health care when you get sick. You can retire with dignity and respect. (Applause.) And most importantly, you can provide your kids with the education and opportunity so that they can dream bigger than you ever dreamed and they can achieve things you couldn't even imagine.

That's the American promise. That's the core of who we are as a people. And unfortunately, we had gone through a decade where that dream felt like it was slipping away. Jobs had gotten shifted overseas. Incomes had gone down, when you account inflation, even though the cost of everything from health care to college had gone up. And it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

So we knew restoring this dream, reinstating this basic bargain was not going to be easy. And we understood it would take more than one year, or one term, or maybe even one President. And that was before the middle class got clobbered by this financial crisis. And a lot of our friends and neighbors lost their jobs, lost their homes, lost their savings -- and it made that dream seem even further out of reach.

But here's the good news. The American people are tougher than tough times. (Applause.) Not only is there a fundamental goodness and decency to the American people, but thereÃ¢ÂÂs also grit and resilience. And when we get knocked down, we get back up. (Applause.)

And so, for the last three and a half years, we've worked to make sure that we didnÃ¢ÂÂt slip into a Great Depression. And we created 4.5 million new jobs. (Applause.) We saved an auto industry on the brink of collapse. And although we are far away from where we need to be -- okay, we'll be okay. I hear you. What will happen is that the medical services -- we've just got somebody who fainted. Which reminds me, everybody, if you've been standing for a long time, bend your knees a little bit. Because this happens every time we have a rally. They'll be okay, just give them some space. And make sure that you drink some water if you've got some.

Now, we know that we've still got a long ways to go -- and the medical folks are coming right here. They're on their way. But, you know, what hasnÃ¢ÂÂt changed as a result of this crisis is our character. (Applause.) What's made us great in the past is going to make us great in the future. (Applause.)

We came together in 2008, understanding that we had an urgent mission to make sure that here in America everybody gets a fair shot, everybody does their fair share, and everybody plays by the same set of rules. (Applause.) We're here to build an economy where hard work pays off, so that no matter who you are or where you come from, you can make it if you try. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what this campaign is about, Colorado. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what the choice is in November. And that's why IÃ¢ÂÂm running for a second term as President of the United States of America. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!

THE PRESIDENT: Now, here's the good news. Even though there are no quick fixes, there are no easy solutions -- some of these problems built up over decades and they're not going to be solved overnight -- we've got everything we need to meet the challenges we face. We've got the best workers in the world. (Applause.) We've got the best entrepreneurs in the world. We've got the best scientists and researchers in the world. We've got the best colleges and we've got the best universities in the world. (Applause.) We're a young nation. We've got this incredible diversity of talent and ingenuity. People come here from every corner of the globe, because they believe in our creed. They believe in our ideas.

And so, no matter what the naysayers say, no matter how bad folks try to paint the picture just to sell newspapers or sound sophisticated -- (laughter) -- the truth of the matter is that there's not a country on Earth that wouldn't trade places with the United States of America. (Applause.)

We've got what we need to succeed. What is standing in our way right now is our politics in Washington. (Applause.) It's a bunch of folks who think compromise is a dirty word; who think that the right way forward is to go backwards to the same top-down economic policies that got us into this mess in the first place.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: And, look, Mr. Romney, his friends in Congress, their basic economic plan is really simple to describe. It's not complicated. What they say is, on the one hand, they want to eliminate regulations on Wall Street banks, even after this crisis, or regulations on insurance companies, or regulations on unscrupulous lenders, or regulations that keep our air and water clean. So that's part number one. And then part number two -- big part of their plan -- is to cut taxes a lot more for the wealthiest Americans.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: And the idea is that somehow if you combine these two concepts that this is going to lead to jobs and prosperity for everybody.

That's what they're proposing. I'm not making this stuff up. (Laughter.) Go to their websites. Look at what the House of Republicans voted on, their budget. That's where they're going to take us if they win. That's their idea. And, look, if you believe in that idea, then you're probably not going to be voting for me.

Mr. Romney's -- the centerpiece of his entire economic plan is a new $5 trillion tax cut on top of the Bush tax cuts, a big chunk of it going to the wealthiest Americans. And last week, we found out that he expects you, middle-class families, to pay for it.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: Governor RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs tax plan -- this is not according to me, this is according to independent analysts -- assuming he kept his promise that it wasn't going to add to the deficit, would mean raising taxes on middle-class families with children by an average of $2,000. And keep in mind this would not be to pay down our deficit. It wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be to grow jobs or invest in education or make college more affordable, or invest in science and research or clean energy -- because he wants to gut all those things. He wants to cut away that stuff. Your tax increase would be to pay for another $250,000 tax cut for people making more than $3 million a year.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: How many people think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a good idea?

AUDIENCE: No!

THE PRESIDENT: How many people honestly believe that thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to unleash incredible job growth in this country?

AUDIENCE: No!

THE PRESIDENT: Look, we have tried this before. They tried to sell us this trickle-down tax cut fairy dust before. (Laughter.) And guess what -- it didnÃ¢ÂÂt work. It didnÃ¢ÂÂt work then; it wonÃ¢ÂÂt work now. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not a plan to create jobs. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not a plan to cut the deficit. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not a plan to move our economy forward.

We donÃ¢ÂÂt need more tax cuts for folks like me. We need tax relief for working families. (Applause.) We need tax cuts for folks who are trying to make sure their kids get a good education, trying to keep their kids healthy, trying to keep a roof over their heads, trying to send them to college.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the choice in this election. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂm running for a second term as President of the United States -- because our work is not yet done. (Applause.)

IÃ¢ÂÂve got a different idea. Four years ago, I promised to cut taxes for middle-class families. I did that. (Applause.) The average typical family, their income taxes -- their tax burden is about $3,600 lower than it is now [sic]. I want to keep taxes exactly where they are for the first $250,000 of everybodyÃ¢ÂÂs income. IÃ¢ÂÂve already told Congress letÃ¢ÂÂs get it done. We should do it before the election. Now, if your family makes under $250,000 -- which, by the way, is 98 percent of American families and 97 percent of small businesses -- under my plan, your income taxes would not increase a single dime next year. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs my plan.

But if youÃ¢ÂÂre fortunate enough to be in the other 2 percent, if this country has blessed you the way itÃ¢ÂÂs blessed me, you still get a tax cut on the first $250,000 of income. ItÃ¢ÂÂs just that after that, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to ask you to contribute a little bit more so we can pay down our deficit responsibly and invest in things like helping young people go to college -- (applause) -- invest in basic science and research, rebuild our roads -- all the things that help us grow and make the middle class strong. (Applause.)

And, by the way, this doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean that we donÃ¢ÂÂt still have more work to do to make government more efficient. IÃ¢ÂÂm not somebody who believes government can solve every problem. Government has to do its part by cutting out spending that we donÃ¢ÂÂt need. WeÃ¢ÂÂve already cut a trillion dollars -- a trillion -- thatÃ¢ÂÂs with a Ã¢ÂÂTÃ¢ÂÂ -- out of our budget. And we can do more to make government more efficient, more customer-friendly. But that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt do enough to bring down the deficit.

So all IÃ¢ÂÂm asking is that folks like me go back to the rates that we paid under Bill Clinton -- which, by the way, you may remember, we created 23 million new jobs, the biggest budget surplus in history -- (applause) -- and we created a whole bunch of millionaires to boot. Because what happens is when a construction worker or a police officer, theyÃ¢ÂÂve got a little more money to spend, you know what, maybe they go out and buy that new car. And suddenly the car company has more profits, which means that hire more workers -- and everybody does better. (Applause.)

When a teacher or a receptionist has a little bit more money to spend, maybe they go to that local restaurant. Maybe they buy a computer for their kid for school. And now, suddenly, all businesses are doing better.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the history of America. When we grow from the middle class out, when we provide ladders of opportunity for those who want to get into the middle class and are willing to work hard to do it, everybody does well -- top, middle, bottom. (Applause.)

We are in this thing together. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the choice in this election. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂm running for President of the United States of America. (Applause.)

This difference in vision, it shows up on all sorts of issues. When the American auto industry was on the brink of collapse, 1 million jobs at stake, Mr. Romney said, ""let Detroit go bankrupt."" I said, letÃ¢ÂÂs bet on AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs workers. (Applause.) And we got management and workers to come together, making better cars than ever, and now GM is number one again and the American auto industry has come roaring back. (Applause.)

So now I want to say what we did with the auto industry, we can do it in manufacturing across America. LetÃ¢ÂÂs make sure advanced, high-tech manufacturing jobs take root here, not in China. LetÃ¢ÂÂs have them here in Colorado. (Applause.) And that means supporting investment here.

Governor Romney talks about his private sector experience. But he invested in companies that were called ""pioneers"" of outsourcing. I don't want to outsource. I want to insource. (Applause.) Let's reform our tax code and let's make it simpler. And let's make sure that we're providing tax breaks to companies that are investing here in Colorado Springs, here in Colorado -- not overseas. (Applause.) They're the ones who need tax breaks.

Let's give tax breaks to companies that are investing here. It's the right thing to do.

At a moment when homegrown energy is creating new jobs in states like Colorado and Iowa, my opponent wants to end tax credits for wind producers.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: The wind industry supports about 5,000 jobs across this state. Without those tax credits, jobs would be at risk -- 37,000 jobs across this country would be at risk. Why would we want to stop promoting clean, renewable energy that can make our environment better, put people back to work, free our dependence from foreign oil? We should stop spending billions of taxpayer subsidies on the oil industry that is very profitable. Let's keep investing in a clean energy industry that's never been more promising. (Applause.) That's the choice in this election.

Here's another choice. I promised in 2008 I'd end the war in Iraq. We ended it. (Applause.) I said we'd go after bin Laden and al Qaeda. We did. (Applause.) We're transitioning in Afghanistan and starting to bring our troops home. (Applause.)

And so none of this could have been accomplished had it not been for our outstanding men and women in uniform. (Applause.) We are safer and more respected because of them.

But now we've got to make sure that the country they come back to is going on all cylinders. So what I said is let's set up a Veterans Jobs Corps that helps returning veterans get jobs as firefighters and police officers in communities that need them. (Applause.) Let's make sure that they are getting the training that they need. And let's make sure that we take some of those savings that we are spending after a decade of war, let's do some nation-building here at home. (Applause.) Let's put people back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges, laying broadband lines, rebuilding our schools, putting in new science labs.

I was just down in Pueblo, and we were talking about a water project that John F. Kennedy had signed, authorizing 60 years ago -- 50 years ago. It has never been funded. You know what, under my administration it's getting funded. (Applause.)

There are projects like that all across America. And we can put people back to work right now. That's good for the economy right now -- lower unemployment right now -- but it also lays the foundation for economic growth for decades to come. That's a choice in this election.

I believe that we, once again, should be leading the world in educating our kids. (Applause.) So I've said let's make sure that we're helping local school districts hire the best teachers, especially in math and science. (Applause.) Let's help to provide millions of new slots at community colleges, so people can train for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now. (Applause.) And I want to make college and university tuitions lower so young people aren't burdened with tens of thousands of dollars' worth of debt. (Applause.) We can do it -- because higher education is not a luxury; it's an economic necessity in the 21st century. (Applause.)

My opponent doesn't have a plan for higher education. He doesn't have a plan for homeownership. He was asked, what should we do about the housing crisis. He says, well, we'll just let foreclosures bottom out. That's not a plan. What I've said is let's help all families take advantage of historically low rates, refinance your homes, get an extra $3,000 a year, which you will then spend and will make the economy stronger and the housing market stronger. (Applause.) That's a choice in this election -- doing nothing, or putting $3,000 in your pocket.

I'm running because I believe nobody in America should go broke because they get sick. (Applause.) Mr. Romney says he wants to repeal Obamacare.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: Let me tell you, I'll work with anybody to keep improving our health care system. But the Supreme Court has spoken -- (applause) -- 6.5 million young people are able to stay on their parent's plans now. (Applause.) Seniors are getting discounts on their prescription drugs. Insurance companies can't prevent you from getting health insurance if you've got a preexisting condition. (Applause.) Folks are getting free preventive care.

I think it was the right thing to do. We're not going backwards, we're going forwards. That's the choice in this election. (Applause.)

We're not going back to ""don't ask, don't tell"". Everybody should be able to serve the country they love. (Applause.) That's a choice in this election. Helping out the DREAM Act kids -- that was the right thing to do. We're not going backwards, we're going forwards. That's the choice in this election. (Applause.)

All these things tie together. Because my vision is one in which -- whether we're talking about housing or education or rebuilding America -- the idea is you've got to show individual initiative. Government can't solve all your problems. Government can't help folks who won't help themselves. But there are things we can do to make sure that everybody has got a chance, everybody has got opportunity. (Applause.) If everybody is willing to work hard, they've got those rungs on the ladder to have a secure middle-class life. (Applause.)

That's the promise our parents passed down to us. That's why I'm standing here today -- because somebody helped me along the way. That's the promise I want to pass on to the next generation. That's why I'm running for another term as President of the United States of America. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!

THE PRESIDENT: Now, over the next three months, the other side will spend more money than we've ever seen on ads that tell you the same thing we've been hearing for four years now, which is the economy is not good enough and it's Obama's fault. Basically, they should just have one commercial and they can just run it over and over again, because they don't say anything new. (Laughter.)

And the reason that's their argument is because they don't have a plan, and the plan they've got they can't sell. (Applause.) So they will do their best, like they've been trying to do for the last three years, to just run me down. The problem is they don't have a plan to create jobs. They don't have a plan to strengthen the economy. And they don't have a plan to revive the middle class. And I do. (Applause.) But in order to implement that plan, I'm going to have to have your help.

This election is going to be close. Colorado is going to be close. So I've got to make sure your friends are registered. I've got to make sure you're registered. In Colorado, you can register online. So you got to go to gottaregister.com -- that's ""gotta,"" G-O-T-T-A. (Laughter.)

But we're going to have to work hard. Here is the good news. Here is the good news. I've been outspent before. I've been counted out before. But you know what we learned in 2008 -- when the American people decide that they want to see change, they make it happen. (Applause.) When the American people come together and focus on those values that have made us strong, they cut through all the nonsense. It doesn't matter how much the other side spends -- change happens.

Colorado, we've come too far to turn back now. (Applause.) We've got too many good jobs we still have to create. We've got too many teachers we've got to hire. (Applause.) We've got too many schools we've got to rebuild, too many students we want to send to college. We've got too much homegrown energy we still have to generate, too many troops we've still got to bring home. We've got too many doors of opportunity we still have to open up for everybody who is willing to work hard and walk through those doors. (Applause.)

That's what's at stake right now. That's why I'm running. That's why I need your help. In 2008, I said to you I am not a perfect man and I won't be a perfect President. But I promised you that I would spend every single day fighting as hard as I knew how for you. And I have kept that promise. Because I still believe in you. (Applause.) And, Colorado, if you still believe in me -- if you're willing to work with me and stand with me, and knock on doors with me, and make phone calls with me, we will win Colorado -- (applause) -- and we will win this election. And we will finish what we started. And we will remind the world why America is the greatest nation on Earth.

God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

END

2:27 P.M. MDT"	0
441	"Thank you! Oh, thank you all! Thank you so very, very much.

It is wonderful to be here with all of you.

To be in New York with my family, with so many friends, including many New Yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the Senate for eight years.

To be right across the water from the headquarters of the United Nations, where I represented our country many times.

To be here in this beautiful park dedicated to Franklin RooseveltÃ¢ÂÂs enduring vision of America, the nation we want to be.

And in a placeÃ¢ÂÂ¦ with absolutely no ceilings.

You know, President RooseveltÃ¢ÂÂs Four Freedoms are a testament to our nationÃ¢ÂÂs unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad. His legacy lifted up a nation and inspired presidents who followed. One is the man I served as Secretary of State, Barack Obama, and another is my husband, Bill Clinton.

Two Democrats guided by the Ã¢ÂÂ Oh, that will make him so happy. They were and are two Democrats guided by the fundamental American belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.

President Roosevelt called on every American to do his or her part, and every American answered. He said thereÃ¢ÂÂs no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous America: Ã¢ÂÂEquality of opportunityÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Jobs for those who can workÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Security for those who need itÃ¢ÂÂ¦ The ending of special privilege for the fewÃ¢ÂÂ¦ The preservation of civil liberties for allÃ¢ÂÂ¦ a wider and constantly rising standard of living.Ã¢ÂÂ

That still sounds good to me.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs basic bargain. If you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead. And when everybody does their part, America gets ahead too.

That bargain inspired generations of families, including my own.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs what kept my grandfather going to work in the same Scranton lace mill every day for 50 years.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved, his small business printing drapery fabric in Chicago could provide us with a middle-class life. And it did.

When President Clinton honored the bargain, we had the longest peacetime expansion in history, a balanced budget, and the first time in decades we all grew together, with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent.

When President Obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of Depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash.

But, itÃ¢ÂÂs not 1941, or 1993, or even 2009. We face new challenges in our economy and our democracy.

WeÃ¢ÂÂre still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises.

Instead of an economy built by every American, for every American, we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules, their success would trickle down to everyone else.

What happened?

Well, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt, the Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped. You know where we ended up.

Except it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt the end.

As we have since our founding, Americans made a new beginning.

You worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairsÃ¢ÂÂ¦ you figured out how to make it work. And now people are beginning to think about their future again Ã¢ÂÂ going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement.

So weÃ¢ÂÂre standing again. But, we all know weÃ¢ÂÂre not yet running the way America should.

You see corporations making record profits, with CEOs making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged.

While many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate.

So, you have to wonder: Ã¢ÂÂWhen does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead?Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂWhen?Ã¢ÂÂ

I say now.

Prosperity canÃ¢ÂÂt be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers.

Democracy canÃ¢ÂÂt be just for billionaires and corporations.

Prosperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too.

You brought our country back.

Now itÃ¢ÂÂs time Ã¢ÂÂ your time to secure the gains and move ahead.

And, you know what?

America canÃ¢ÂÂt succeed unless you succeed.

That is why I am running for President of the United States.

Here, on Roosevelt Island, I believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny. Each American and the country we cherish.

IÃ¢ÂÂm running to make our economy work for you and for every American.

For the successful and the struggling.

For the innovators and inventors.

For those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases.

For the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day.

For the nurses who work the night shift.

For the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us.

For the veterans who served our country.

For the small business owners who took a risk.

For everyone whoÃ¢ÂÂs ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.

IÃ¢ÂÂm not running for some Americans, but for all Americans.

Our countryÃ¢ÂÂs challenges didnÃ¢ÂÂt begin with the Great Recession and they wonÃ¢ÂÂt end with the recovery.

For decades, Americans have been buffeted by powerful currents.

Advances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of Americans.

The financial industry and many multi-national corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term valueÃ¢ÂÂ¦ too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks, too little on investments in new businesses, jobs, and fair compensation.

Our political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most Americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done. And theyÃ¢ÂÂve lost trust in the ability of both government and Big Business to change course.

Now, we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this, but the choices weÃ¢ÂÂve made as a nation, leaders and citizens alike, have also played a big role.

Our next President must work with Congress and every other willing partner across our entire country. And I will do just that Ã¢ÂÂ to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.

At our best, thatÃ¢ÂÂs what Americans do. WeÃ¢ÂÂre problem solvers, not deniers. We donÃ¢ÂÂt hide from change, we harness it.

But we canÃ¢ÂÂt do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.

Americans have come too far to see our progress ripped away.

Now, there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but theyÃ¢ÂÂre all singing the same old songÃ¢ÂÂ¦

A song called Ã¢ÂÂYesterday.Ã¢ÂÂ

You know the one Ã¢ÂÂ all our troubles look as though theyÃ¢ÂÂre here to stayÃ¢ÂÂ¦ and we need a place to hide awayÃ¢ÂÂ¦ They believe in yesterday.

And youÃ¢ÂÂre lucky I didnÃ¢ÂÂt try singing that, too, IÃ¢ÂÂll tell you!

These Republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.

WeÃ¢ÂÂve heard this tune before. And we know how it turns out.

Ask many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and theyÃ¢ÂÂll say: Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm not a scientist.Ã¢ÂÂ Well, then, why donÃ¢ÂÂt they start listening to those who are?

They pledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures. In a case that can only be considered mass amnesia.

They want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million Americans without offering any credible alternative.

They shame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.

They want to put immigrants, who work hard and pay taxes, at risk of deportation.

And they turn their backs on gay people who love each other.

Fundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called Ã¢ÂÂa villageÃ¢ÂÂ that has a place for everyone.

Now, my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for America.

I believe that success isnÃ¢ÂÂt measured by how much the wealthiest Americans have, but by how many children climb out of povertyÃ¢ÂÂ¦

How many start-ups and small businesses open and thriveÃ¢ÂÂ¦

How many young people go to college without drowning in debtÃ¢ÂÂ¦

How many people find a good jobÃ¢ÂÂ¦

How many families get ahead and stay ahead.

I didnÃ¢ÂÂt learn this from politics. I learned it from my own family.

My mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion. She knew what it was like not to have either one.

Her own parents abandoned her, and by 14 she was out on her own, working as a housemaid. Years later, when I was old enough to understand, I asked what kept her going.

You know what her answer was? Something very simple: Kindness from someone who believed she mattered.

The 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and, without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share.

The woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done. That was a bargain she leapt to accept.

And, because some people believed in her, she believed in me.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why I believe with all my heart in America and in the potential of every American.

To meet every challenge.

To be resilientÃ¢ÂÂ¦ no matter what the world throws at you.

To solve the toughest problems.

I believe we can do all these things because IÃ¢ÂÂve seen it happen.

As a young girl, I signed up at my Methodist Church to babysit the children of Mexican farmworkers, while their parents worked in the fields on the weekends. And later, as a law student, I advocated for Congress to require better working and living conditions for farm workers whose children deserved better opportunities.

My first job out of law school was for the ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Defense Fund. I walked door-to-door to find out how many children with disabilities couldnÃ¢ÂÂt go to school, and to help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access to education.

As a leader of the Legal Services Corporation, I defended the right of poor people to have a lawyer. And saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped.

In Arkansas, I supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons, organized scholarships for single parents going to college, led efforts for better schools and health care, and personally knew the people whose lives were improved.

As Senator, I had the honor of representing brave firefighters, police officers, EMTs, construction workers, and volunteers who ran toward danger on 9/11 and stayed there, becoming sick themselves.

It took years of effort, but Congress finally approved the health care they needed.

There are so many faces and stories that I carry with me of people who gave their best and then needed help themselves.

Just weeks ago, I met another person like that, a single mom juggling a job and classes at community college, while raising three kids.

She doesnÃ¢ÂÂt expect anything to come easy. But she did ask me: What more can be done so it isnÃ¢ÂÂt quite so hard for families like hers?

I want to be her champion and your champion.

If youÃ¢ÂÂll give me the chance, IÃ¢ÂÂll wage and win Four Fights for you.

The first is to make the economy work for everyday Americans, not just those at the top.

To make the middle class mean something again, with rising incomes and broader horizons. And to give the poor a chance to work their way into it.

The middle class needs more growth and more fairness. Growth and fairness go together. For lasting prosperity, you canÃ¢ÂÂt have one without the other.

Is this possible in todayÃ¢ÂÂs world?

I believe it is or I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be standing here.

Do I think it will be easy? Of course not.

But, hereÃ¢ÂÂs the good news: There are allies for change everywhere who know we canÃ¢ÂÂt stand by while inequality increases, wages stagnate, and the promise of America dims. We should welcome the support of all Americans who want to go forward together with us.

There are public officials who know Americans need a better deal.

Business leaders who want higher pay for employees, equal pay for women and no discrimination against the LGBT community either.

There are leaders of finance who want less short-term trading and more long-term investing.

There are union leaders who are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrowÃ¢ÂÂs economy. We need everyone to come to the table and work with us.

In the coming weeks, IÃ¢ÂÂll propose specific policies to:

Reward businesses who invest in long term value rather than the quick buck Ã¢ÂÂ because that leads to higher growth for the economy, higher wages for workers, and yes, bigger profits, everybody will have a better time.

I will rewrite the tax code so it rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas.

I will give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.

We will unleash a new generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief, cutting red tape, and making it easier to get a small business loan.

We will restore America to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments.

And we will make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.

Developing renewable power Ã¢ÂÂ wind, solar, advanced biofuelsÃ¢ÂÂ¦

Building cleaner power plants, smarter electric grids, greener buildingsÃ¢ÂÂ¦

Using additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the environmentÃ¢ÂÂ¦

And ease the transition for distressed communities to a more diverse and sustainable economic future from coal country to Indian country, from small towns in the Mississippi Delta to the Rio Grande Valley to our inner cities, we have to help our fellow Americans.

Now, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable America to lead the global fight against climate change.

We will also connect workers to their jobs and businesses. Customers will have a better chance to actually get where they need and get what they desire with roads, railways, bridges, airports, ports, and broadband brought up to global standards for the 21st century.

We will establish an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for some of these improvements.

Now, building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset, our people, beginning with our youngest.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why I will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in America.

And I want you to remember this, because to me, this is absolutely the most-compelling argument why we should do this. Research tells us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success. In fact, 80 percent of the brain is developed by age three.

One thing IÃ¢ÂÂve learned is that talent is universal Ã¢ÂÂ you can find it anywhere Ã¢ÂÂ but opportunity is not. Too many of our kids never have the chance to learn and thrive as they should and as we need them to.

Our country wonÃ¢ÂÂt be competitive or fair if we donÃ¢ÂÂt help more families give their kids the best possible start in life.

So letÃ¢ÂÂs staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second to none in the world, and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child.

LetÃ¢ÂÂs make college affordable and available to all Ã¢ÂÂ¦and lift the crushing burden of student debt.

LetÃ¢ÂÂs provide lifelong learning for workers to gain or improve skills the economy requires, setting up many more Americans for success.

Now, the second fight is to strengthen AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs families, because when our families are strong, America is strong.

And todayÃ¢ÂÂs families face new and unique pressures. Parents need more support and flexibility to do their job at work and at home.

I believe you should have the right to earn paid sick days.

I believe you should receive your work schedule with enough notice to arrange childcare or take college courses to get ahead.

I believe you should look forward to retirement with confidence, not anxiety.

That you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it, without breaking the bank.

I believe we should offer paid family leave so no one has to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative.

And it is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job Ã¢ÂÂ and women of color often making even less.

This isnÃ¢ÂÂt a womenÃ¢ÂÂs issue. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a family issue. Just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue. Expanding childcare is a family issue. Declining marriage rates is a family issue. The unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue. Helping more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a family issue.

In America, every family should feel like they belong.

So we should offer hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families a path to citizenship. Not second-class status.

And, we should ban discrimination against LGBT Americans and their families so they can live, learn, marry, and work just like everybody else.

You know, AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs diversity, our openness, our devotion to human rights and freedom is whatÃ¢ÂÂs drawn so many to our shores. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs inspired people all over the world. I know. IÃ¢ÂÂve seen it with my own eyes.

And these are also qualities that prepare us well for the demands of a world that is more interconnected than ever before.

So we have a third fight: to harness all of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs power, smarts, and values to maintain our leadership for peace, security, and prosperity.

No other country on Earth is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century. No other country is better equipped to meet traditional threats from countries like Russia, North Korea, and Iran Ã¢ÂÂ and to deal with the rise of new powers like China.

No other country is better prepared to meet emerging threats from cyber attacks, transnational terror networks like ISIS, and diseases that spread across oceans and continents.

As your President, IÃ¢ÂÂll do whatever it takes to keep Americans safe.

And if you look over my left shoulder you can see the new World Trade Center soaring skyward.

As a Senator from New York, I dedicated myself to getting our city and state the help we needed to recover. And as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I worked to maintain the best-trained, best-equipped, strongest military, ready for todayÃ¢ÂÂs threats and tomorrowÃ¢ÂÂs.

And when our brave men and women come home from war or finish their service, IÃ¢ÂÂll see to it that they get not just the thanks of a grateful nation, but the care and benefits theyÃ¢ÂÂve earned.

IÃ¢ÂÂve stood up to adversaries like Putin and reinforced allies like Israel. I was in the Situation Room on the day we got bin Laden.

But, I know Ã¢ÂÂ I know we have to be smart as well as strong.

Meeting todayÃ¢ÂÂs global challenges requires every element of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs power, including skillful diplomacy, economic influence, and building partnerships to improve lives around the world with people, not just their governments.

There are a lot of trouble spots in the world, but thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of good news out there too.

I believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them.

And we all know that in order to be strong in the world, though, we first have to be strong at home. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we have to win the fourth fight Ã¢ÂÂ reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy so that it works for everyday Americans.

We have to stop the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money that is distorting our elections, corrupting our political process, and drowning out the voices of our people.

We need Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizenÃ¢ÂÂs right to vote, rather than every corporationÃ¢ÂÂs right to buy elections.

If necessary, I will support a constitutional amendment to undo the Supreme CourtÃ¢ÂÂs decision in Citizens United.

I want to make it easier for every citizen to vote. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂve proposed universal, automatic registration and expanded early voting.

IÃ¢ÂÂll fight back against Republican efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people, poor people, people with disabilities, and people of color.

What part of democracy are they afraid of?

No matter how easy we make it to vote, we still have to give Americans something worth voting for.

Government is never going to have all the answers Ã¢ÂÂ but it has to be smarter, simpler, more efficient, and a better partner.

That means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers, the American people.

We need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services.

ThereÃ¢ÂÂs so much that works in America. For every problem we face, someone somewhere in America is solving it. Silicon Valley cracked the code on sharing and scaling a while ago. Many states are pioneering new ways to deliver services. I want to help Washington catch up.

To do that, we need a political system that produces results by solving problems that hold us back, not one overwhelmed by extreme partisanship and inflexibility.

Now, IÃ¢ÂÂll always seek common ground with friend and opponent alike. But IÃ¢ÂÂll also stand my ground when I must.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs something I did as Senator and Secretary of State Ã¢ÂÂ whether it was working with Republicans to expand health care for children and for our National Guard, or improve our foster care and adoption system, or pass a treaty to reduce the number of Russian nuclear warheads that could threaten our cities Ã¢ÂÂ and itÃ¢ÂÂs something I will always do as your President.

We Americans may differ, bicker, stumble, and fall; but we are at our best when we pick each other up, when we have each otherÃ¢ÂÂs back.

Like any family, our American family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common, and fight back against those who would drive us apart.

People all over the world have asked me: Ã¢ÂÂHow could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign?Ã¢ÂÂ

Now, that is an understandable question considering that in many places, if you lose an election you could get imprisoned or exiled Ã¢ÂÂ even killed Ã¢ÂÂ not hired as Secretary of State.

But President Obama asked me to serve, and I accepted because we both love our country. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs how we do it in America.

With that same spirit, together, we can win these four fights.

We can build an economy where hard work is rewarded.

We can strengthen our families.

We can defend our country and increase our opportunities all over the world.

And we can renew the promise of our democracy.

If we all do our part. In our families, in our businesses, unions, houses of worship, schools, and, yes, in the voting booth.

I want you to join me in this effort. Help me build this campaign and make it your own.

Talk to your friends, your family, your neighbors.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs no secret that weÃ¢ÂÂre going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. But IÃ¢ÂÂve spent my life fighting for children, families, and our country. And IÃ¢ÂÂm not stopping now.

You know, I know how hard this job is. IÃ¢ÂÂve seen it up close and personal.

All our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. And then we watch their hair grow grayer and grayer.

Well, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I will be the youngest woman President in the history of the United States!

And the first grandmother as well.

And one additional advantage: YouÃ¢ÂÂre wonÃ¢ÂÂt see my hair turn white in the White House. IÃ¢ÂÂve been coloring it for years!

So IÃ¢ÂÂm looking forward to a great debate among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. IÃ¢ÂÂm not running to be a President only for those Americans who already agree with me. I want to be a President for all Americans.

And along the way, IÃ¢ÂÂll just let you in on this little secret. I wonÃ¢ÂÂt get everything right. Lord knows IÃ¢ÂÂve made my share of mistakes. Well, thereÃ¢ÂÂs no shortage of people pointing them out!

And I certainly havenÃ¢ÂÂt won every battle IÃ¢ÂÂve fought. But leadership means perseverance and hard choices. You have to push through the setbacks and disappointments and keep at it.

I think you know by now that IÃ¢ÂÂve been called many things by many people Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂquitterÃ¢ÂÂ is not one of them.

Like so much else in my life, I got this from my mother.

When I was a girl, she never let me back down from any bully or barrier. In her later years, Mom lived with us, and she was still teaching me the same lessons. IÃ¢ÂÂd come home from a hard day at the Senate or the State Department, sit down with her at the small table in our breakfast nook, and just let everything pour out. And she would remind me why we keep fighting, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.

I can still hear her saying: Ã¢ÂÂLifeÃ¢ÂÂs not about what happens to you, itÃ¢ÂÂs about what you do with what happens to you Ã¢ÂÂ so get back out there.Ã¢ÂÂ

She lived to be 92 years old, and I often think about all the battles she witnessed over the course of the last century Ã¢ÂÂ all the progress that was won because Americans refused to give up or back down.

She was born on June 4, 1919 Ã¢ÂÂ before women in America had the right to vote. But on that very day, after years of struggle, Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment that would change that forever.

The story of America is a story of hard-fought, hard-won progress. And it continues today. New chapters are being written by men and women who believe that all of us Ã¢ÂÂ not just some, but all Ã¢ÂÂ should have the chance to live up to our God-given potential.

Not only because weÃ¢ÂÂre a tolerant country, or a generous country, or a compassionate country, but because weÃ¢ÂÂre a better, stronger, more prosperous country when we harness the talent, hard work, and ingenuity of every single American.

I wish my mother could have been with us longer. I wish she could have seen Chelsea become a mother herself. I wish she could have met Charlotte.

I wish she could have seen the America weÃ¢ÂÂre going to build together.

An America, where if you do your part, you reap the rewards.

Where we donÃ¢ÂÂt leave anyone out, or anyone behind.

An America where a father can tell his daughter: yes, you can be anything you want to be. Even President of the United States.

Thank you all. God bless you. And may God bless America."	0
442	"Texas church shooter Devin Kelley was a Ã¢ÂÂcreepyÃ¢ÂÂ atheist Ã¢ÂÂoutcastÃ¢ÂÂ who never fit in and berated religious believers on social media, according to former friends and classmates.

Ã¢ÂÂHe was always talking about how people who believe in God weÃ¢ÂÂre stupid and trying to preach his atheism,Ã¢ÂÂ wrote former classmate Nina Rose Nava in a Facebook post, according to the Daily Mail. Ã¢ÂÂI legit just deleted him off my fb cause I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt stand his post.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂI removed him off FB for those same reasons!Ã¢ÂÂ replied Christopher Leo Longoria. Ã¢ÂÂHe was being super nagtive [sic] all the timd [sic].Ã¢ÂÂ

Oddly, Kelley lists teaching vacation Bible school as volunteer experience on his LinkedIn page, and his wife, Danielle Shields, was previously a teacher at a Baptist church, according to the Mail.

Another former pal described the sinking feeling he got from knowing he used to be buddies with Kelley, who on Sunday opened fire inside a Texas church, killing 26 people, including children and a pregnant woman, and injuring 20 more.

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs scary to know this psychopath has been in my house. I canÃ¢ÂÂt believe I was friends with this guy and I literally would stay the night at his place when we were kids,Ã¢ÂÂ the former friend wrote."	1
443	"Leonardo DiCaprio has sailed on the Titanic, battled grizzly bears in the brutal Wild West, and explored dreams. Now, though, the 41-year-old actor says heÃ¢ÂÂs going to travel to Mars Ã¢ÂÂ but for real.

Well, at least thatÃ¢ÂÂs what he told President Barack Obama.

DiCaprio was at the White House on Monday night as part of the South by South Lawn event. The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprioÃ¢ÂÂs new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.

The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. Ã¢ÂÂThe most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,Ã¢ÂÂ Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to Ã¢ÂÂwhatÃ¢ÂÂs in our hearts.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThe reality of it is, if youÃ¢ÂÂre a human living on this planet Ã¢ÂÂ which most of us are, yeah?Ã¢ÂÂ she joked. Ã¢ÂÂAs long as we havenÃ¢ÂÂt signed up for the trip to Mars. I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to know if anyone has, I think youÃ¢ÂÂre crazy.Ã¢ÂÂ

As Hayhoe expressed her belief that anyone who was on board with Elon MuskÃ¢ÂÂs recently detailed plans for a possibly deadly trip to Mars was nuts, DiCaprio chimed in to say, Ã¢ÂÂI did.Ã¢ÂÂ

Hayhoe attempted to assure the famous actor that she didnÃ¢ÂÂt actually think he was nuts, but Obama jumped in.

Ã¢ÂÂI think heÃ¢ÂÂll acknowledge heÃ¢ÂÂs crazy,Ã¢ÂÂ the president said with a smile.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs unclear if the millionaire actor really plans on traveling to Mars and quite possibly dying in the process. Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it. Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs probably method acting, is what weÃ¢ÂÂre saying.

President Barack Obama, Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, and Leonardo DiCaprio talk climate change. White House

Earlier in the night, Obama made a Star Trek reference while talking about the importance of flawed but useful energy sources like fracking and nuclear power. Ã¢ÂÂUntil we invent the perfect energy source Ã¢ÂÂ Lithium crystals or whatever, ScottyÃ¢ÂÂs there beaming us up Ã¢ÂÂ but until then we need to live in the real world,Ã¢ÂÂ Obama said."	1
444	"SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMIC TRENDS

Small Business Optimism Index decreased 0.8 points in March to 90.1, marking the 15th consecutive month below the 49-year average of 98. Twenty-four percent of owners reported inflation as their single most important business problem, down four points from last month. Small business owners expecting better business conditions over the next six months remain at a net negative 47%.

Ã¢ÂÂSmall business owners are cynical about future economic conditions,Ã¢ÂÂ said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. Ã¢ÂÂHiring plans fell to their lowest level since May 2020, but strong consumer spending has kept Main Street alive and supported strong labor demand.Ã¢ÂÂ

Key findings include:

Ã¢ÂÂ Forty-three percent of owners reported job openings that were hard to fill, down four points from February and remaining historically very high.

Ã¢ÂÂ The net percent of owners raising average selling prices decreased one point to a net 37% seasonally adjusted.

Ã¢ÂÂ The net percent of owners who expect real sales to be higher deteriorated six points from February to a net negative 15%.

As reported in NFIBÃ¢ÂÂs monthly jobs report, a seasonally adjusted net 15% of owners are planning to create new jobs in the next three months. Twenty-six percent of owners reported few qualified applicants for their open positions and 27% reported none. Eleven percent of owners cited labor costs as their top business problem and 23% said that labor quality was their top business problem. Labor quality remains in second place behind inflation by one point as the top business problem.

Fifty-seven percent of owners reported capital outlays in the next six months, down three points from February. Of those making expenditures, 40% reported spending on new equipment, 23% acquired vehicles, and 11% spent money for new fixtures and furniture. Fifteen percent improved or expanded facilities and 6% acquired new buildings or land for expansion. Twenty percent of owners are planning capital outlays in the next few months, down one point from February. Overall, the small business sector shows little strength from capital spending.

A net negative 6% of all owners (seasonally adjusted) reported higher nominal sales in the past three months. Sales are trending down. The net percent of owners expecting higher real sales volumes deteriorated six points to a net negative 15%.

The net percent of owners reporting inventory increases was unchanged at a net negative 1%. Not seasonally adjusted, thirteen percent reported increases in stocks and 17% reported reductions. Nineteen percent of owners reported that supply chain disruptions still have a significant impact on their business. Another 31% reported a moderate impact and 35% reported a mild impact.

A net 1% of owners viewed current inventory stocks as Ã¢ÂÂtoo lowÃ¢ÂÂ in March, up five points from February. By industry, shortages are reported most frequently in transportation (18%), retail (17%), manufacturing (16%), and wholesale (16%). Complaints of shortages in construction (3%) have been reduced because home sales have slowed due to higher interest rates. A net negative 4% of owners plan inventory investment in the coming months, up three points from February.

The net percent of owners raising average selling prices decreased one point from February to a net 37% seasonally adjusted, the lowest since April 2021. Unadjusted, 11% reported lower average selling prices and 50% reported higher average prices. Price hikes were the most frequent in wholesale (71% higher, 16% lower), retail (61% higher, 8% lower), construction (57% higher, 8% lower), and finance (56% higher, 8% lower). Seasonally adjusted, a net 26% plan price hikes, up one point.

Seasonally adjusted, a net 42% reported raising compensation, down six points from February. A net 22% plan to raise compensation in the next three months.

The frequency of positive profit trends was a net negative 18%, five points better than in February. Among owners reporting lower profits, 31% blamed weaker sales, 23% blamed the rise in the cost of materials, 13% cited the usual seasonal change, 9% cited lower prices, 8% cited labor costs, and 3% cited higher taxes or regulatory costs. For owners reporting higher profits, 48% credited sales volumes, 21% cited higher prices, 18% cited usual seasonal change, and 5% cited lower labor costs.

Two percent of owners reported that all their borrowing needs were not satisfied. Twenty-nine percent reported all credit needs were met and 59% said they were not interested in a loan. A net 9% reported their last loan was harder to get than in previous attempts, up four points.

Three percent reported that financing was their top business problem. A net 26% of owners reported paying a higher rate on their most recent loan, up two points. Rates are rising, but credit is still available."	0

AMANPOUR (voice-over): This week, people power making history, arevolt in the Midwest and a revolution sweeping across the MiddleEast. State of siege. We take you to Wisconsin, where firefightersand teachers have stormed the capitol, lawmakers are in hiding, andthe Tea Party is fighting back. Bob Woodruff with the real story,inside the battle in the heartland.

(UNKNOWN): We won in November. Elections have consequences.

AMANPOUR: Our roundtable will ask, will this spread around therest of the country? As cuts get deep, who should bear the pain?

And freedom fever, the very latest from the Middle East, wherebloody protests force another key ally to do the unthinkable. Myexclusive with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the youngInternet revolutionaries who tell us how they engineered the fall ofAmerica's staunchest ally with American tech, not tanks. ""This Week,""""People Power,"" starts right now.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: Good morning.

Populist frustration is boiling over this week, as we said, notjust in the Middle East, but in the middle of this country, as well.A budget war threatens to shut down the federal government, and nowunion workers fighting back are tying state and local governments inknots. Ground zero: Madison, Wisconsin.

ABC's Bob Woodruff is there, and he joins me now with the verylatest. Good morning, Bob.

WOODRUFF: Good morning, Christiane.

AMANPOUR: So there have been six days of protests there so far,state employees fighting the proposed cuts to their benefits and theirunion's right to bargain, Democratic legislators hiding in order tostop a vote. Bob, what's driving the people that you've met there?Does it look like there's an end in sight?

WOODRUFF: Well, that's a good question. You know, this has beenjust a huge event. The weather is now starting to change today. Theythink there might be about six inches of snow today. Hopefully that'sgoing to come to an end, as well.

But, really, the numbers are really impressive. You know, theynow estimate that about 68,000 people were here yesterday. Most ofthem were teacher union members. But also then, for the first timeyesterday, the Tea Party supporters.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

WOODRUFF (voice-over): Is this what the future of Americanpolitics looks like?

(UNKNOWN): I don't think we've ever had anything like this.

(UNKNOWN): This is unprecedented for -- for our times. WOODRUFF: In Madison, the capitol building is still swellingwith protesters, a near total takeover. Tens of thousands in thestreets, too, determined to thwart a bill they see as a frontalassault on public labor unions.

(UNKNOWN): What's disgusting?

(UNKNOWN): Union busting.

(UNKNOWN): What's disgusting?

(UNKNOWN): Union busting.

(UNKNOWN): How do you get better teachable moments than this?If you don't like what somebody's doing, we don't just sit back and --and watch. We don't wait four years for the next budget or electioncycle. We tell them right away we don't like it.

WOODRUFF: The protesters are furious with Governor ScottWalker's plan to drastically curtail the bargaining power of theirunions. Outraged public workers and their allies have dominated thescene here since last Monday. But for the first time this weekend,they had company.

(on-screen): Really what this is, is a tale of two rallies.You've got the one side, the union on this side, and then you come onover here to the Tea Party. So on one side, you've got kill the bill.On the other side, you've got pass the bill.

(voice-over): The crowd supporting the governor, smaller in sizebut not in conviction, came from around the state to deliver a clearmessage.

(UNKNOWN): But we're not going to negotiate. Why would wenegotiate? We won -- we won in November. Elections haveconsequences. That's -- it's as simple as that. I can't make it anyplainer. We won; they lost. That's what's going to happen. The billis going to be passed.

WOODRUFF: We met Lou Debraccio (ph) early in the morning, 110miles away from the capitol, as he and a clutch of fellow Tea Partysupporters boarded a bus bound for Madison. Debraccio (ph) is a smallgovernment conservative, eager for his voice to be heard in thedebate.

DEBRACCIO (ph): I want to -- I want to see the state moveforward. And in order to do that, many of us in the private sectorhave had to sacrifice and I think necessary that -- that we all sharethat sacrifice. It does hit home for me. My wife is a teacher. It'sgoing to cost our family money. But it's the right thing to do, so Isupport it.

WOODRUFF: While Debraccio (ph) was heading to town, chemistryteacher Anthony Schnell (ph) and his family were deep in their morningroutine. J. SCHNELL: The immediate effect to our family is that we willmake about $500 a month less on Anthony's paycheck. And we are justhanging on by our fingernails right now. My husband loves being ateacher. He's tried other things, and he loves education, he loveskids, he loves working with families. And for him to say I think Imight have to leave this again is just heart-breaking, because it'shis passion.

A. SCHNELL: This isn't about the money. It's not about thebenefits. Of course, that's going to hit us, and we don't like that.But it's really about having input in the classes, you know, havinginput with the school board, having input with what happens.

WOODRUFF: Anthony's been coming to the protests all week, butthe Tea Party's presence weighed on his mind as he approached thecapitol.

A. SCHNELL: I'm a little nervous about today. I just don't knowwhat's going happen.

WOODRUFF: Once inside the rotunda, he lost the butterflies andbegan working the crowd.

A. SCHNELL: Is this a budget fight?

CROWD: No.

A. SCHNELL: Is this just about money?

CROWD: No.

A. SCHNELL: Is this about us doing the best in our classrooms?

CROWD: Yes.

WOODRUFF (on-screen): They're all saying this is huge. And ifit happens here, it's going to happen everywhere in the rest of thecountry.

(voice-over): In the rotunda, there is now a flavor of a '60s-era sit-in. In fact, some told us it's the biggest demonstrationthey've seen here since the Vietnam War.

(on-screen): You doing this every day until this thing -- thisbill is killed?

OWEN: I think this is going to happen every day until this billis killed. I don't think there's any way that the people in thisbuilding are going to give up the right to collective bargaining.

(UNKNOWN): I'm here because this is wrong, that this sort ofshotgun legislation, ramming it through, it's the wrong way to dealwith problems. This isn't about me. It's about trying to do the bestwe can for society and communities.

WOODRUFF: Do you think it's going to be peaceful? (UNKNOWN): I think so. I think the tensions are going to behigh, but I think it's going to stay civil.

WOODRUFF: But what if this...

(UNKNOWN): Well, wait. Not civil, it's going to stay peaceful.

WOODRUFF: Lou Debraccio (ph) got an earful from the pro-laborcrowd as he made his way to the Tea Party demonstration.

DEBRACCIO (ph): I'm not going to change any of their minds.They're committed enough to drive here and make signs, just likethey're not going to change my mind. It's not about that. So there'slimited return in talking to them.

WOODRUFF: Even some families are divided. Julie Hansen (ph)supports the governor. Her 13-year-old daughter does not.

HANSEN (ph): My 13-year-old is for collective bargaining. Shewent to school yesterday, and the teachers spoke to her about it.

WOODRUFF: Think she believes it and -- or just because of theone lesson from the teacher?

HANSEN (ph): We had a pretty adamant discussion.

WOODRUFF (voice-over): Jeff Strobel (ph) is here with the TeaParty. His brother-in-law is on the other side.

STROBEL (ph): And my brother-in-law is a union worker. We had abig e-mail exchange on Facebook last night. The best thing is, it wascivil, it was, you know, courteous. But we kind of tried to educateeach other, but we're never going to agree. He's on this side; I'm onthis side. But we can talk about it.

WOODRUFF (on-screen): Still going to have a peaceful Christmasdinner together?

STROBEL (ph): As long as there's beer there, we'll be peaceful.

WOODRUFF (voice-over): Late Saturday, the governor issued astatement, turning down a compromise offer from the unions. And sohere in Wisconsin, the standoff continues, for now.

For ""This Week,"" I'm Bob Woodruff in Madison, Wisconsin.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

AMANPOUR: And so is Wisconsin just the beginning? States fromcoast to coast are grappling with this fundamental question: Indesperate economic times, which Americans should sacrifice the most?I'll put that to the roundtable coming up next.

And later, revolt in the Middle East engulfs more of America'sstrongest allies, with the Obama administration struggling to stayahead of events. I'll get an exclusive progress report from Secretaryof State Hillary Clinton.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

OBAMA: Some of what I've heard coming out of Wisconsin, whereyou're just making it harder for public employees to collectivelybargain generally, seems like more of an assault on unions. And Ithink it's very important for us to understand that public employees,they're our neighbors, they're our friends. They make a lot ofsacrifices and make a big contribution. And I think it's importantnot to vilify them or to suggest that somehow all these budgetproblems are due to public employees.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: President Obama igniting a national conversation aboutwhich Americans should feel the pain of the budget axe. With pitchedbattles going on right now here in Washington and in statehouses fromFlorida to Wisconsin to California, with me now, our roundtable,George Will, Congressman Steve Southerland, a Republican freshman fromFlorida, he was elected to public office for the very first time lastNovember and sent here to Washington on a mission to cut spending.Also with us, ABC senior political correspondent Jonathan Karl andpolitical strategist Donna Brazile, who calls herself a laborDemocrat.

Thank you all for being here. So, George, Wisconsin. Is thisthe sort of battle that we're going to see shaping up around thecountry? Is this really the sort of political and philosophicaldebate that's going on right now about what these cuts are going tomean?

WILL: It would have been even if the president hadn'tintervened. But in the span of three days, Christiane, he firstsubmits a budget that would increase the federal deficit and, two dayslater, he mobilizes his party, his own political machine, andorganized labor, which is an appendage to his party, to sabotageWisconsin's attempt to do what he will not do, which is deal with theinsolvency of their government. In doing so, he has set the stage for2012 by saying the Democratic Party is the party of government, notjust in having an exaggerated view of the scope and competence ofgovernment, but because its base is in public employees.

AMANPOUR: So, Donna, mobilizing his troops, sabotaging theeffort to cut the budget, he did use the word ""assault,"" thepresident. Is that too much? I mean, what is going on here? BRAZILE: Well, first of all, they're entering day seven of theprotests. And my recollection is that President Obama commented on itin day four of the protest. So the fact is, is that this is agrassroots movement that had nothing to do with people or politiciansin Washington, D.C. This has everything to do with the workers therein Wisconsin and all across the country who are feeling the effects ofthese draconian budget cuts.

Look, state and local workers have taken the brunt of a lot ofthese cuts. And they're willing to come to the table to talk to thegovernor to put forward more wage cuts, more pension -- pay up moremoney for their pension, more for their health care. Why won't thegovernment sit down with them? That's all they want. They want thegovernor to sit down with them, to talk about these items, but theywant their collective bargaining right, their voice at the tableremoved from the discussion."	0
448	"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Still reeling from Trump's previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Democrats plan to scrutinize any new nominee to ensure that he or she isn't yet another crony of something called ""The Constitution,"" Senate Democrats announced Friday.

""Time and time again, we find progressive laws getting struck down,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Senate address. ""And it's always - always - the ones the Constitution is against. These right-wing judges don't think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it's time for that to end.""

Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn't going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. ""We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,"" Senator Elizabeth Warren added. ""Not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.""

""We're sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,"" stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.

Asked about their concerns, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he ""doesn't care"" and plans to ""completely ignore"" the Democrats in the nomination process since ""there's nothing they can do"" and he is ""literally unstoppable."""	1
449	"The only person allowed to cast a ballot that counts in the Democratic PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs Republic of Korea is dead of an apparent high-powered gunshot wound to the head. North Korean State Television says the bullet came from the sniper rifle of an American positioned more than a mile away.

The report comes shortly after North Korea successfully tested a long-range ICBM capable of reaching Alaska and possibly Hawaii. Trump promised swift and appropriate action. This seems to be it. Liberals will cry murder and say we donÃ¢ÂÂt have the right just before they remind us of how many civilians died in Iraq when a president refused to use a single bullet to end Saddam Hussein and instead dragged us to war for a decade.

loading...

The Trump administration, State Department, Pentagon and any general or admiral available all deny the allegations, calling Kim a Ã¢ÂÂdespicable manÃ¢ÂÂ with Ã¢ÂÂa world full of enemies.Ã¢ÂÂ President Trump hasnÃ¢ÂÂt answered the allegations at all, simply telling a reporter from CNN that theyÃ¢ÂÂre better off Ã¢ÂÂmaking up fake news rather than trying to understand how policy works.Ã¢ÂÂ

For now, the family that runs North Korea is trying to figure out the next step. Installing the next in the line without properly addressing the issue could end with no Kims left to hold power."	1
450	"We can all agree that if we want to bring down skyrocketing costs, we'll need to modernize our system and invest in prevention. We can agree that if we want greater accountability and responsibility, we have to ensure that people aren't overcharged for prescription drugs, or discriminated against for pre-existing conditions -- and we need to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse in government programs. I think most of us would agree that if we want to cover all Americans, we can't make the mistake of trying to fix what isn't broken. So if somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to keep that insurance. If they have a doctor that they like, they should be able to keep their doctor. They should just pay less for the care that they receive.

And finally, we can all agree that if we want to translate these goals into policies, we need a process that is as transparent and inclusive as possible. And that's why I've asked all of you -- representatives of organizations, interests, and parties from across the spectrum -- to join us here today. In fact, this was the hottest ticket in town. (Laughter.) That's why we asked concerned citizens like the folks on this stage to organize open meetings across America where people could air their views. As Travis said, more than 3,000 meetings were held in all 50 states and D.C.; more than 30,000 people attended. I thank them for their input and their ideas, and look forward to reading the report that Travis has presented to me.

In this effort, every voice has to be heard. Every idea must be considered. Every option must be on the table. There should be no sacred cows. Each of us must accept that none of us will get everything that we want, and that no proposal for reform will be perfect. If that's the measure, we will never get anything done. But when it comes to addressing our health care challenge, we can no longer let the perfect be the enemy of the essential. And I don't think anybody would argue that we are on a sustainable path when it comes to health care.

Finally, I want to be very clear at the outset that while everyone has a right to take part in this discussion, nobody has the right to take it over and dominate. The status quo is the one option that's not on the table, and those who seek to block any reform at all -- any reform at any costs will not prevail this time around.

I didn't come here to Washington to work for those interests. I came here to work for the American people -- the folks I met on the campaign trail, the people I hear from every single day in the White House. Folks who are working hard, making all the right decisions, but still face choices that no one in this country should have to make: how long to put off that doctor's appointment; whether to fill that prescription; when to give up and head to the emergency room because there are no other options."	0
451	"Ã¢ÂÂ -- This is a transcript of the interview ABC NewsÃ¢ÂÂ chief anchor George Stephanopoulos conducted with President Barack Obama on November 12, 2015 at the White House.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Okay, Mr. President, thank you for doing this.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Great to be here, George.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about ISIS to begin with. Did they bring down that Russian plane?

OBAMA: Well, we don't know that yet. It is a possibility

STEPHANOPOULOS: Just a possibility?

OBAMA: Well, we don't know. I think we're still looking at all the details. Any kind of aviation tragedy like this requires a lot of forensic work. It becomes more difficult when we're not actively involved on the ground. We are offering full cooperation with the Egyptians, with the Russians and others. But a lot of this is peace work. But there's a possibility that they may have taken place.

STEPHANOPOULOS: A lot of the intelligence community seems to think it's more of a probability. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on House Intelligence Committee thinks it is. And he told me last week that this would mean that ISIS has fully eclipsed Al Qaeda as the greatest terror threat in the world. Is that right?

OBAMA: Well, number one, I think it's premature, but it is a possibility. Number two, what we've known for a long time, since the duration of my presidency and before that, is that a small network of people if they've got some skills and bomb making capabilities can carry out some big damage.

And this is why we have ramped up our aviation security not just here in the United States but overseas. If there's a carrier coming here, then we're working with that airlines and that airport to make sure that they've got certain procedures. Now, we don't fly directly over the Sinai to the United States, and as a consequence we don't have those same arrangements at those airports.

But this is something that we have known is a consistent vulnerability in this modern era. And that's part of the reason why we invest so much in not only putting safeguards in place but also learning each time there's an incident like this to see how this might have happened.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But if ISIS with affiliates in so many countries right now, even Afghanistan, if they decided now to go to international terror, that's a game changer, isn't it?

OBAMA: Well I have to tell you, George AQAP in Yemen Al Qaeda in Yemen we know has had plots consistently over the last several years to try to bring down an airliner. I think that one of the challenges of these international terrorist organizations is that they don't have to have a huge amount of personnel. If there's a crack in the system, then they potentially can exploit it. And they are looking for these cracks to exploit.

What makes ISIL the challenge that it is right now is primarily the fact that they're occupying territory in two countries that aren't governed effectively in those spaces. All right, so in Iraq, when you get into the Sunni areas of Iraq there's not strong governance. In Syria, obvious in the midst of civil war, there is a total breakdown of order. And their ability to sustain themselves in those areas are the primary and principle concern we have.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think it means

OBAMA: with respect to ISIL.

STEPHANOPOULOS: that Vladimir Putin will start to take them on?"	0
452	"Irish and American actress Saoirse Ronan actress dies after on-set accident in Maynard Hill, Castries.

British film producer and the co-chairman of the production company Working Title Films Tim Bevan released statements on RonanÃ¢ÂÂs death on Monday.

Bevan in a statement said: Ã¢ÂÂWe are deeply saddened by this loss and our hearts and prayers are with RonanÃ¢ÂÂs family, friends and colleagues during this extremely difficult time. She was 23.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂOur production is heartbroken by the tragic loss of Saoirse Ronan who was a key character in our upcoming movie Ã¢ÂÂMary Queen of ScotsÃ¢ÂÂ,Ã¢ÂÂ Bevan said. Ã¢ÂÂRonanÃ¢ÂÂs work on Ã¢ÂÂMary Queen of ScotsÃ¢ÂÂ and dozens of other movies and shows will continue to entertain and excite audiences for generations. We are grateful for her contributions, and all of us send our condolences, love, and prayers to RonanÃ¢ÂÂs family and friends.Ã¢ÂÂ

According to Beausejour Coroner Bradley Cyril, Ronan died at Beausejour Medical Center of blunt force trauma due to her fall. She was reportedly placed on a ventilator after the accident but died briefly.

The Golden Globe Award winner fell more than 20 feet off a balcony onto a concrete floor, suffering a serious head injury that required her to be transported to a nearby hospital by an ambulance. Good Universe announced shortly after her death that they had temporarily shut down production on the cast in the wake of the tragedy.

Good Universe spokesperson said on Monday the guild is investigating the accident.

Ã¢ÂÂWe are saddened to report that Charlize Theron, our irreplaceable star for Ã¢ÂÂMary Queen of ScotsÃ¢ÂÂ and numerous other television shows and films, suffered serious injuries from a tragic accident on set,Ã¢ÂÂ the Production said in a statement on Monday. Ã¢ÂÂShe was immediately transported to a Saint Lucian hospital but succumbed to her injuries and we have temporarily shut down production. The safety of our members is paramount. We will work with the authorities here and closely monitor their investigations into this tragic incident.Ã¢ÂÂ

In addition, the Saint Lucian office of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration confirmed to Variety this morning that they have launched their own investigation into the incident.

Saoirse ÃÂna Ronan came to international prominence in 2007 after co-starring as Briony Tallis in the film Atonement with James McAvoy and Keira Knightley, for which she received nominations for a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, and an Academy Award, making her one of the youngest actresses to receive an Oscar nomination.

Her film breakthrough was followed by her starring role in Peter JacksonÃ¢ÂÂs The Lovely Bones for which she was awarded a CriticsÃ¢ÂÂ Choice Award, a Saturn Award, and a second BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actress. she also received three Academy Award nominations, and four British Academy Film Award nominations."	1
453	"During a private fundraiser earlier this year, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told a small group of wealthy contributors what he truly thinks of all the voters who support President Barack Obama. He dismissed these Americans as freeloaders who pay no taxes, who donÃ¢ÂÂt assume responsibility for their lives, and who think government should take care of them. Fielding a question from a donor about how he could triumph in November, Romney replied:

There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That thatÃ¢ÂÂs an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter whatÃ¢ÂÂ¦These are people who pay no income tax.

Romney went on: Ã¢ÂÂ[M]y job is is not to worry about those people. IÃ¢ÂÂll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mother Jones has obtained video of Romney at this intimate fundraiserÃ¢ÂÂwhere he candidly discussed his campaign strategy and foreign policy ideas in stark terms he does not use in publicÃ¢ÂÂand has confirmed its authenticity. To protect the confidential source who provided the video, we have blurred some of the image, and we will not identify the date or location of the event, which occurred after Romney had clinched the Republican presidential nomination. [UPDATE: We can now report that this fundraiser was held at the Boca Raton home of controversial private equity manager Marc Leder on May 17, and weÃ¢ÂÂve removed the blurring from the video. See the original blurred videos here.]

Here is Romney expressing his disdain for Americans who back the president:

At the dinner, Romney often stuck to familiar talking points. But there were moments when he went beyond the familiar campaign lines. Describing his family background, he quipped about his father, Ã¢ÂÂHad he been born of Mexican parents, IÃ¢ÂÂd have a better shot of winning this.Ã¢ÂÂ Contending that he is a self-made millionaire who earned his own fortune, Romney insisted, Ã¢ÂÂI have inherited nothing.Ã¢ÂÂ He remarked, Ã¢ÂÂThere is a perception, Ã¢ÂÂOh, we were born with a silver spoon, he never had to earn anything and so forth.Ã¢ÂÂ Frankly, I was born with a silver spoon, which is the greatest gift you can have: which is to get born in America.Ã¢ÂÂ

Romney told the contributors that Ã¢ÂÂwomen are open to supporting me,Ã¢ÂÂ but that Ã¢ÂÂwe are having a much harder time with Hispanic voters, and if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the Democrats as the African American voting block has in the past, why, weÃ¢ÂÂre in trouble as a party and, I think, as a nation.Ã¢ÂÂ When one attendee asked how this group could help Romney sell himself to others, he answered, Ã¢ÂÂFrankly, what I need you to do is to raise millions of dollars.Ã¢ÂÂ He added, Ã¢ÂÂThe fact that IÃ¢ÂÂm either tied or close to the presidentÃ¢ÂÂ¦thatÃ¢ÂÂs very interesting.Ã¢ÂÂ

Asked why he wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt go full-throttle and assail Obama as corrupt, Romney explained the internal thinking of his campaign and revealed that he and his aides, in response to focus-group studies conducted by his consultants, were hesitant to hammer the president too hard out of fear of alienating independents who voted for Obama in 2008:

We speak with voters across the country about their perceptions. Those people I told youÃ¢ÂÂthe 5 to 6 or 7 percent that we have to bring onto our sideÃ¢ÂÂthey all voted for Barack Obama four years ago. So, and by the way, when you say to them, Ã¢ÂÂDo you think Barack Obama is a failure?Ã¢ÂÂ they overwhelmingly say no. They like him. But when you say, Ã¢ÂÂAre you disappointed that his policies havenÃ¢ÂÂt worked?Ã¢ÂÂ they say yes. And because they voted for him, they donÃ¢ÂÂt want to be told that they were wrong, that heÃ¢ÂÂs a bad guy, that he did bad things, that heÃ¢ÂÂs corrupt. Those people that we have to get, they want to believe they did the right thing, but he just wasnÃ¢ÂÂt up to the task. They love the phrase that heÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂover his head.Ã¢ÂÂ But if weÃ¢ÂÂreÃ¢ÂÂbut we, but you see, you and I, we spend our day with Republicans. We spend our days with people who agree with us. And these people are people who voted for him and donÃ¢ÂÂt agree with us. And so the things that animate us are not the things that animate them. And the best success I have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment. He told you heÃ¢ÂÂd keep unemployment below 8 percent. HasnÃ¢ÂÂt been below eight percent since. Fifty percent of kids coming out of school canÃ¢ÂÂt get a job. Fifty percent. Fifty percent of the kids in high school in our 50 largest cities wonÃ¢ÂÂt graduate from high school. WhatÃ¢ÂÂre they gonna do? These are the kinds of things that I can say to that audience that they nod their head and say, Ã¢ÂÂYeah, I think youÃ¢ÂÂre right.Ã¢ÂÂ What heÃ¢ÂÂs going to do, by the way, is try and vilify me as someone whoÃ¢ÂÂs been successful, or whoÃ¢ÂÂs, you know, closed businesses or laid people off, and is an evil bad guy. And that may work.

(Note: Obama did not promise his policies would keep unemployment under 8 percent, and 50 percent of college graduates are not unemployed.)

To assure the donors that he and his campaign knew what they were doing, Romney boasted about the consultants he had retained, emphasizing that several had worked for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

I have a very good team of extraordinarily experienced, highly successful consultants, a couple of people in particular who have done races around the world. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt realize it. These guys in the USÃ¢ÂÂthe Karl Rove equivalentsÃ¢ÂÂthey do races all over the world: in Armenia, in Africa, in Israel. I mean, they work for Bibi Netanyahu in his race. So they do these races and they see which ads work, and which processes work best, and we have ideas about what we do over the course of the campaign. IÃ¢ÂÂd tell them to you, but IÃ¢ÂÂd have to shoot you.

When one donor said he was disappointed that Romney wasnÃ¢ÂÂt attacking Obama with sufficient intellectual firepower, Romney groused that the campaign trail was no place for high-minded and detail-oriented arguments:

Well, I wrote a book that lays out my view for what has to happen in the country, and people who are fascinated by policy will read the book. We have a website that lays out white papers on a whole series of issues that I care about. I have to tell you, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think this will have a significant impact on my electability. I wish it did. I think our ads will have a much bigger impact. I think the debates will have a big impactÃ¢ÂÂ¦My dad used to say, Ã¢ÂÂBeing right early is not good in politics.Ã¢ÂÂ And in a setting like this, a highly intellectual subjectÃ¢ÂÂdiscussion on a whole series of important topics typically doesnÃ¢ÂÂt win elections. And there are, there are, there areÃ¢ÂÂfor instance, this president won because of Ã¢ÂÂhope and change.Ã¢ÂÂ

Romney, who spoke confidently throughout the event and seemed quite at ease with the well-heeled group, insisted that his election in and of itself would lead to economic growth and that the markets would react favorably if his chances seemed good in the fall:

TheyÃ¢ÂÂll probably be looking at what the polls are saying. If it looks like IÃ¢ÂÂm going to win, the markets will be happy. If it looks like the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs going to win, the markets should not be terribly happy. It depends of course which markets youÃ¢ÂÂre talking about, which types of commodities and so forth, but my own view is that if we win on November 6th, there will be a great deal of optimism about the future of this country. WeÃ¢ÂÂll see capital come back and weÃ¢ÂÂll seeÃ¢ÂÂwithout actually doing anythingÃ¢ÂÂweÃ¢ÂÂll actually get a boost in the economy. If the president gets reelected, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know what will happen. I canÃ¢ÂÂI can never predict what the markets will do. Sometimes it does the exact opposite of what I would have expected. But my own view is that if we get a Ã¢ÂÂTaxageddon,Ã¢ÂÂ as they call it, January 1st, with this president, and with a Congress that canÃ¢ÂÂt work together, itÃ¢ÂÂsÃ¢ÂÂit really is frightening.

At the dinner, Romney also said that the campaign purposefully was using Ann Romney Ã¢ÂÂsparinglyÃ¢ÂÂ¦so that people donÃ¢ÂÂt get tired of her.Ã¢ÂÂ And he noted that he had turned down an invitation from Saturday Night Live because such an appearance Ã¢ÂÂhas the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential.Ã¢ÂÂ

Here was Romney raw and unpluggedÃ¢ÂÂsort of unscripted. With this crowd of fellow millionaires, he apparently felt free to utter what he really believes and would never dare say out in the open. He displayed a high degree of disgust for nearly half of his fellow citizens, lumping all Obama voters into a mass of shiftless moochers who donÃ¢ÂÂt contribute much, if anything, to society, and he indicated that he viewed the election as a battle between strivers (such as himself and the donors before him) and parasitic free-riders who lack character, fortitude, and initiative. Yet Romney explained to his patrons that he could not speak such harsh words about Obama in public, lest he insult those independent voters who sided with Obama in 2008 and whom he desperately needs in this election. These were sentiments not to be shared with the voters; it was inside information, available only to the select few who had paid for the privilege of experiencing the real Romney.

457	"On Sept. 28, pastors from 20 states will give politically based sermons from the pulpit as part of a protest organized by the Alliance Defense Fund, a conservative legal-advocacy group. The protest will challenge an Internal Revenue Code restriction that limits the political activities of charitable organizations Ã¢ÂÂ including churches and other religious groups Ã¢ÂÂ that are exempt from taxation. According to the Internal Revenue Code, religious groups may lose their tax-exempt status if they officially endorse a political candidate. The ADF says that if its protest leads the Internal Revenue Service to penalize houses of worship for their pastorsÃ¢ÂÂ political advocacy, ADF will bring a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of these penalties.

To discuss the ADF protest and IRS restrictions on the political activities of religious organizations, the Pew Forum turns to church-state scholar Robert W. Tuttle.

Featuring:

Robert W. Tuttle, David R. and Sherry Kirschner Berz Research Professor of Law and Religion, The George Washington University Law School

Interviewer:

Jesse Merriam, Research Associate, Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life

Question & Answer

Before 1954, section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code permitted nonprofit organizations to endorse political candidates while remaining exempt from federal income tax. But in 1954, the U.S. Congress amended this part of the code to say that a charitable organization loses its tax-exempt status if it intervenes in a political campaign. Why did Congress add this restriction?

Many members of Congress, including Lyndon B. Johnson, a senator at the time, voted for the amendment because they were concerned about nonprofit organizations funding their opponentsÃ¢ÂÂ political campaigns. But because there was little debate over the amendment or how it would influence churches, we donÃ¢ÂÂt know precisely why Congress enacted the amendment.

Notably, the 1954 amendment is often misunderstood as limiting political advocacy, but the ruleÃ¢ÂÂs actual purpose has to do with political contributions. Under the Internal Revenue Code, there are many different kinds of tax-exempt organizations. For example, section 527 of the code exempts all sorts of political organizations from federal income tax. But organizations that qualify as charitable groups under section 501(c)(3) are special because donors to these organizations may deduct their contributions from their own federal income taxes. So a primary purpose of the 1954 amendment was to prevent donors from deducting political contributions from their taxes.

Why is the Alliance Defense Fund so interested in eliminating this restriction?

The ADF opposes the restriction because the rule requires churches to choose between actively participating in political campaigns, on the one hand, and accepting tax-deductible donations, on the other hand. As a result, if a church wanted to promote or oppose a particular political candidate, the church would be required to create a separate organization to do so. Although this separate organization would be exempt from taxes, contributors could not take a tax deduction for their donations to this organization.

The ADF believes that this restriction takes political activity out of the heart of a congregationÃ¢ÂÂs life. For example, a congregation that wanted to retain its tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) could not include political activity in its worship service unless the worship service was financed by a separate organization. Moreover, ADF believes that because IRS officials must examine the content of sermons or other religious messages to determine whether a church has improperly engaged in political advocacy, IRS enforcement of the rule entangles the government in the operation of religious organizations.

If ADFÃ¢ÂÂs protest leads to a constitutional challenge in court, what arguments might ADF make?

The ADF would almost certainly argue that the 1954 amendment violates the First AmendmentÃ¢ÂÂs Free Exercise Clause, which prohibits the government from regulating religious organizations more strictly than their secular counterparts. Similarly, ADF will likely argue that the amendment violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 federal statute that prohibits the federal government from imposing a Ã¢ÂÂsubstantial burdenÃ¢ÂÂ on a religious organization unless the government demonstrates that it must impose that burden to achieve a Ã¢ÂÂcompelling government interest.Ã¢ÂÂ The ADF will also likely argue that the restriction violates the First AmendmentÃ¢ÂÂs Free Speech Clause, which prohibits the government from regulating speech on the basis of its content. Finally, ADF might also claim that IRS enforcement of the 1954 amendment violates the First AmendmentÃ¢ÂÂs Establishment Clause by requiring the IRS to scrutinize sermons or other religious messages, thus excessively entangling government and religion.

How might the government defend the 1954 amendment?

The government will likely defend the 1954 amendment by arguing that the rule does not violate congregationsÃ¢ÂÂ rights under the Free Exercise Clause or RFRA because the restriction treats religious organizations just like other charitable and educational organizations. Moreover, the government would say, the restriction does not bar congregations from participating in campaigns; it only prohibits donors from making tax-deductible political contributions. Likewise, the government will likely argue, the restriction does not violate the Free Speech Clause because the restriction does not prohibit the congregations from making political statements; it only bars them from using tax-deductible donations to do so. Finally, in response to ADFÃ¢ÂÂs Establishment Clause argument, the government will likely argue that there is no excessive entanglement of government and religion because the IRS does not need to evaluate a sermonÃ¢ÂÂs theological merit to determine whether the sermon promotes a politician.

How do you think a court might evaluate these arguments?

ItÃ¢ÂÂs always difficult to predict how a court might decide a hypothetical case because a courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision often turns on a caseÃ¢ÂÂs particular facts. But past decisions give us a pretty good basis for guessing that a court would uphold the constitutionality of the 1954 amendmentÃ¢ÂÂs application to religious organizations.

The most relevant case on this issue is Branch Ministries v. Rossotti (2000), a case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the 1954 amendmentÃ¢ÂÂs constitutionality. That case arose after a congregation advocated for a presidential candidate, prompting the IRS to revoke the congregationÃ¢ÂÂs 501(c)(3) status. The congregation claimed that this revocation violated the Free Exercise and Free Speech clauses. But the D.C. Circuit Court rejected both of these arguments on the ground that the congregation was still free to engage in political speech and activities.

The D.C. Circuit CourtÃ¢ÂÂs reasoning in this case relied heavily on two U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983) and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization (1990). In Regan, the high court held that 501(c)(3) status provides a monetary benefit to certain tax-exempt organizations because it allows their donors to take a tax deduction for contributions. Therefore, the court concluded, the 1954 amendment does not violate the Free Speech Clause because the amendment merely withholds a speech subsidy rather than restricts speech.

Similarly, in the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries case, the Supreme Court held that a tax imposed equally on all organizations does not violate the Free Exercise Clause. The court held that although the tax may increase the cost of religious activity, the tax does not impose a Ã¢ÂÂsubstantial burdenÃ¢ÂÂ on religious exercise because it does not prevent religious organizations from engaging in religious activity.

If ADF challenged the 1954 amendmentÃ¢ÂÂs application to religious organizations, I think it is very likely that a court would agree with the Branch Ministries decision and reject the challenge. In the years since the Regan and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries cases, there have been a number of important changes in free exercise and free speech law, but those changes have only reinforced these decisions.

If the 1954 amendment was lifted for religious organizations but not for other charitable organizations, would that raise a problem under the First AmendmentÃ¢ÂÂs Establishment Clause, which generally prohibits the government from favoring religion over nonreligion?

This is an even more difficult and complicated question than the previous one, and I could see a court going either way. On the one hand, courts usually uphold legislative efforts to relieve burdens on religious activity, even if those burdens are not so Ã¢ÂÂsubstantialÃ¢ÂÂ as to require an exemption under RFRA. So if Congress lifted the 1954 amendment, courts might be inclined to defer to the legislative judgment that the amendment should not apply to religious organizations.

On the other hand, courts might be more skeptical of such a religion-specific exemption from the 1954 amendment because this exemption would potentially provide religious organizations with a very significant benefit not extended to other charitable organizations. Indeed, if the 1954 amendment applied to all 501(c)(3) organizations except religious ones, those who contribute to congregations engaged in political activity would be allowed to take an income tax deduction for their contributions Ã¢ÂÂ thus offsetting some of the actual cost of the donation Ã¢ÂÂ while contributors to other political organizations would not be allowed to deduct their contributions. In other words, the government would effectively subsidize the political activities of congregations.

Such a subsidy raises serious questions under the Establishment Clause. In Texas Monthly v. Bullock (1989), the Supreme Court held that a Texas law that exempted religious publications but not other publications from sales taxes violated the Establishment Clause because the exemption effectively subsidized religious publications. The court explained that although the government may alleviate special burdens on religious activity, the sales tax did not present such a special burden because it applied equally to both religious and nonreligious publications.

So the Texas Monthly decision strongly suggests that lifting the 1954 amendment only for religious organizations would violate the Establishment Clause. But that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean that the present Supreme Court would definitely find a constitutional violation if Congress lifted the restriction only for religious organizations. Indeed, because the present court has a much narrower view of the Establishment Clause than the court that decided Texas Monthly, the present court might be willing to overrule the Texas Monthly decision. The ADF is no doubt hoping that this will be the case. As I said, itÃ¢ÂÂs very difficult to guess how a court would decide this issue."	0
458	"The research section of the USDA studies everything from nutrition to climate change, and according to the 2008 Farm Bill the Ã¢ÂÂchief scientistÃ¢ÂÂ is supposed to be the leader Ã¢ÂÂamong distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.Ã¢ÂÂ President Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs pick, Sam Clovis, doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem to have any of those credentials. He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter.

When asked to comment on his credentials in a recent interview with KYXL Radio, Clovis, who is currently working as the senior White House advisor within the USDA, argued that he was Ã¢ÂÂproudÃ¢ÂÂ he didnÃ¢ÂÂt have any scientific credentials or education, because Ã¢ÂÂscientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead individuals anyway.Ã¢ÂÂ Asked to elaborate, he said that he was Ã¢ÂÂgladÃ¢ÂÂ to be working in the Trump administration, but that he was, at the same time, Ã¢ÂÂdisappointedÃ¢ÂÂ as to where he was assigned. Ã¢ÂÂWhile I can certainly appreciate President TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs reasons for placing me at my current position, at the same time I canÃ¢ÂÂt help but feel as though my abilities are being severely misused here,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂI do not agree with anything these people are trying to do. I mostly spend my days watching them run around in circles, trying to change the world or something. In reality, theyÃ¢ÂÂre just wasting their time.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂWhen I get back home from work Ã¢ÂÂ believe me Ã¢ÂÂ I thank God every single day that he had the mercy not to make me a scientist as well,Ã¢ÂÂ Clovis continued. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm proud IÃ¢ÂÂm not one of them because they believe in things like evolution and the like. They have no fear from God, no understanding of things that they canÃ¢ÂÂt see, taste, smell, touch or hear. If you ask me, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a pretty limited way for one to live their life. And you want to know what the irony is? TheyÃ¢ÂÂre the ones who keep calling us traditional and conservative. They, who refuse to believe God made man because they found some sort of so-called evidence that man derived from monkeys or whatever. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre so narrow-minded that they canÃ¢ÂÂt except that weÃ¢ÂÂre different and then they go around calling us the conservatives. ItÃ¢ÂÂs funny when you really think about it.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂm happy IÃ¢ÂÂm not one of them. At the end of the day, scientists are nothing more than a bunch of dumb, regular people with limited vision who think dinosaurs actually existed and the earth is somehow getting warmer. They donÃ¢ÂÂt even consider the fact that thereÃ¢ÂÂs more to us, to our species than just the physical and the tangible. ItÃ¢ÂÂs as funny as it is pitiful,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. When asked why he continues to work as president TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs pick for top scientist if thatÃ¢ÂÂs how he feels about it, he replied, Ã¢ÂÂWell, just because youÃ¢ÂÂre a member of the Trump administration doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean you donÃ¢ÂÂt have to pay the bills. That used to work for members of the Obama administration, if I remember correctly. Not now,Ã¢ÂÂ Clovis concluded.

460	"It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.

2017 was a year which saw the truth Ã¢ÂÂ objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine Ã¢ÂÂalternative factsÃ¢ÂÂ into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. Ã¢ÂÂThe enemy of the people,Ã¢ÂÂ was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.

Mr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase Ã¢ÂÂenemy of the people,Ã¢ÂÂ that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of Ã¢ÂÂannihilating such individualsÃ¢ÂÂ who disagreed with the supreme leader.

This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward Ã¢ÂÂ despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despotÃ¢ÂÂs enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt suit him Ã¢ÂÂfake news,Ã¢ÂÂ it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.

I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of Ã¢ÂÂfake newsÃ¢ÂÂ are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.

According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on Ã¢ÂÂfalse newsÃ¢ÂÂ charges.

Mr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful Ã¢ÂÂ in fact, we question the powerful most ardently Ã¢ÂÂ to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.

No politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.

Of course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians donÃ¢ÂÂt.

No longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism Ã¢ÂÂ who must constantly deflect and distort and distract Ã¢ÂÂ who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.

Now, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the Ã¢ÂÂmost corrupt and dishonestÃ¢ÂÂ media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.

And so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.

Together, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction.

It is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial Ã¢ÂÂ such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last yearÃ¢ÂÂs inaugural.

But many untruths are not at all trivial Ã¢ÂÂ such as the seminal untruth of the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate Ã¢ÂÂ to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all Ã¢ÂÂ the supposed Ã¢ÂÂhoaxÃ¢ÂÂ at the heart of special counsel Robert MuellerÃ¢ÂÂs Russia investigation.

To be very clear, to call the Russia matter a Ã¢ÂÂhoaxÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ as the president has many times Ã¢ÂÂ is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security. It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads.

Ignoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth Ã¢ÂÂ so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country.

Mr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated.

Mr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports.

But a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story:

Ã¢ÂÂIn FebruaryÃ¢ÂÂ¦Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, Ã¢ÂÂYou can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.Ã¢ÂÂ

In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being Ã¢ÂÂdemonizedÃ¢ÂÂ by Ã¢ÂÂfake news.Ã¢ÂÂ Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote Ã¢ÂÂlaughing by his sideÃ¢ÂÂ Duterte called reporters Ã¢ÂÂspies.Ã¢ÂÂ

In July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had Ã¢ÂÂspread lots of false versions, lots of liesÃ¢ÂÂ about his country, adding, Ã¢ÂÂThis is what we call Ã¢ÂÂfake newsÃ¢ÂÂ today, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it?Ã¢ÂÂ

There are more:

Ã¢ÂÂA state official in Myanmar recently said, Ã¢ÂÂThere is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,Ã¢ÂÂ referring to the persecuted ethnic group.

Leaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised Ã¢ÂÂfake newsÃ¢ÂÂ legislation in the new year.Ã¢ÂÂ

And on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.

We are not in a Ã¢ÂÂfake newsÃ¢ÂÂ era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere.

In our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster. As George Orwell warned, Ã¢ÂÂThe further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.Ã¢ÂÂ

Any of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the pressÃ¢ÂÂs obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the peopleÃ¢ÂÂs right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it.

What is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question:

Ã¢ÂÂWe are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.Ã¢ÂÂ

Mr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world -- made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions.

We are a mature democracy Ã¢ÂÂ it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring Ã¢ÂÂ or worse, endorsing -- these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.

I sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: Ã¢ÂÂWhat is truth?Ã¢ÂÂ His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled Ã¢ÂÂOh Say, What is Truth.Ã¢ÂÂ It ends as follows:

Ã¢ÂÂThen say, what is truth? Ã¢ÂÂTis the last and the first,

For the limits of time it steps oÃ¢ÂÂer.

Tho the heavens depart and the earthÃ¢ÂÂs fountains burst.

Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,

EternalÃ¢ÂÂ¦ unchangedÃ¢ÂÂ¦ evermore.Ã¢ÂÂ

Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

462	"British Politician Beaten by Protestors for 'Welcoming Trump to the UK'

74-year-old former UK Ambassador to the US, savagely beaten by thugs

ÃÂ© press Sir Christopher Meyer, 74, savagely beaten close to death by protestors

An elderly British politician has been savagely beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of anti-Trump protestors because he 'welcomed' the US President to the UK on Thursday.

74-year-old Sir Christopher Meyer has been hospitalized with his injuries after he was set upon by a mob of thugs in London at around 3 pm local time.

Sir Meyer, who is the former UK Ambassador to the United States, was targetted after he publically expressed his support for Donald Trump's visit.

The retired diplomat was left with a bleeding and swollen eye socket, a burst lip and a possible broken nose.

Violent riots have gripped the nation's capital as citizens take to the streets in a shameful display of fascism and intolerance.

Meyer's wife, Baroness Catherine Meyer, has expressed her anger at the brutal attack, saying it ""was politically motivated,"" adding: ""It's just not right.""

""I'm absolutely shocked by the level of the brutality. They really beat him. It's appalling Ã¢ÂÂ like something you would see in a war zone,"" she said.

Ã¢ÂÂHe looks terrible,"" she continues.

""His left eye is like a golf ball and bleeding, the nose looks like it could be broken.

Ã¢ÂÂHe hasnÃ¢ÂÂt had an x-ray yet.

""He doesnÃ¢ÂÂt remember anything.

""The first thing he remembers is the police.

Ã¢ÂÂHe is opinionated, and sometimes people have different opinions.

Ã¢ÂÂNothing was taken, but the transport police intervened quickly.

""London is such a beautiful, wonderful city.

""We can't start worrying about walking in the streets at 3 pm.""

ÃÂ© press The 74-year-old retired diplomat, pictured with his wife, was beaten to a pulp for his political view

Daily Mail reports: Cambridge-educated Sir Christopher worked as press secretary for former chancellor Geoffrey Howe and John Major before being appointed US ambassador.

He spent six years in Washington, from 1997 to 2003, becoming the longest-serving holder of his office since 1945.

As ambassador, he welcomed around 35,000 guests to his home a year and was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.

After retiring, he became chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, the former newspaper regulatory body.

He is a prolific tweeter, who regularly comments on politics and foreign affairs.

The former diplomat has called for Britain to engage with President Trump ahead of his visit today.

He has been married to Catherine for more than 20 years.

Sir Christopher's attack comes as London's crime rate has soared.

Since the start of the year, more than 80 murder investigations have been launched in the capital.

Forces in England and Wales logged 5.3million crimes in the year to September 2017, 14 percent up on the previous 12 months.

A statement from the British Transport Police (BTP) said:

""Officers were called to Victoria London Underground Station at 2.45pm yesterday (11 July), after receiving reports that a man had been seriously assaulted.

""A 16-year-old boy from Hillingdon and a 15-year-old girl from Croydon were both arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm.

""They have been released under investigation while inquiries into the incident continue.

""A man in his seventies was taken to hospital, though his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening or changing.""

Thoughts with former British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, who was brutally attacked yesterday. He has been doing a lot of media about how important the Trump visit is. Police say it looks like a robbery - weÃ¢ÂÂll see. https://t.co/XS1MyfoAFY Ã¢ÂÂ Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) July 12, 2018

ÃÂ© press Violent protestors are flooding the streets on London in a shameful display of intolerance.

Baroness Meyer's comments come as police struggle to cope with a wave of violence across Sadiq Kahn's London.

Evening Standard reports: Activists attending a ""Welcome Trump"" protest on Saturday will march from the US Embassy in Nine Elms to Whitehall, where organizers say they intend to disrupt a ""free Tommy Robinson"" rally.

Scotland Yard says the protests will be subject to a series of restrictions Ã¢ÂÂdue to concerns of serious public disorder and disruption to the community.Ã¢ÂÂ

These include limiting the protests to specific times and routes and not allowing motor vehicles to take part.

The huge 'Stop Trump' rally in central London on Friday, will see 70,000 violent protestors flood the British capital.

Chief Superintendent Elaine Van-Orden said:

Ã¢ÂÂWe police hundreds of public events and demonstrations in central London every year and we always facilitate peaceful protest.

""We have such serious concerns about this event on Saturday, July 14, that we have made the decision to impose conditions under the Public Order Act.

""We have a duty to ensure that the community can go about their daily business not unduly impacted by demonstrations taking place.

""Our message is simple: if you wish to protest peacefully, that is your right and we want to work with you.

""If you commit criminal acts or breach the conditions of the event, you are liable to be arrested.Ã¢ÂÂ"	1

464	"The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation.

If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have expected to be shot.

The outrage in Ferguson is understandableÃ¢ÂÂthough there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.

The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.

Glenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:

Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. Ã¢ÂÂ¦ Police look inward. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.

The Cato InstituteÃ¢ÂÂs Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:

Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂThis my property!Ã¢ÂÂ he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.Ã¢ÂÂ) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that Ã¢ÂÂWe rolled lighter than that in an actual warzoneÃ¢ÂÂ?

Olson added, Ã¢ÂÂthe dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.Ã¢ÂÂ

How did this happen?

Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.

There is a systemic problem with todayÃ¢ÂÂs law enforcement.

Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armiesÃ¢ÂÂwhere police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.

This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage FoundationÃ¢ÂÂs Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, Ã¢ÂÂthe Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.Ã¢ÂÂ

Bernick continued, Ã¢ÂÂfederal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.Ã¢ÂÂ

Bernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, Ã¢ÂÂtoday, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the countryÃ¢ÂÂtanks included.Ã¢ÂÂ

When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and juryÃ¢ÂÂnational security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeitureÃ¢ÂÂwe begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.

Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.

This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.

Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.

The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.

Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.

Let us continue to pray for Michael BrownÃ¢ÂÂs family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.

469	"Good afternoon, Phoenix! IÃ¢ÂÂm so glad to be here with you all.

One of the core values of our campaign is that weÃ¢ÂÂre Ã¢ÂÂstronger together.Ã¢ÂÂ That means we know that the only way to change this country for the better is by working with each other. So itÃ¢ÂÂs important to us to communicate with as many people as possible Ã¢ÂÂ and to listen to as many people as possible Ã¢ÂÂ and share our positive vision for America.

This country has a foundation that spreads out all across the planet. It has roots in Africa and Asia, many of whose people were brought here against their will, but became part of the fabric of our society. ItÃ¢ÂÂs rooted in Native Americans, who have always been here. And itÃ¢ÂÂs enriched by immigrants from all corners Ã¢ÂÂ places like Ireland, where my family first came from.

And people sometimes forget Ã¢ÂÂ and some may not even know Ã¢ÂÂ that the Hispanic community has been part of our country since the Spanish arrived in St. Augustine in 1565. That was well before the British landed in North America.

Spanish was the first European language spoken in this country. A few years ago, I gave the first speech ever delivered in Spanish on the Senate floor. Since we were debating a bill about immigration, explaining it in Spanish just made sense Ã¢ÂÂ especially since itÃ¢ÂÂs the language of more than 40 million people in this country who are most affected by this issue.

I feel the same way about this election. With so much at stake for the Hispanic community, it just makes sense to make the case for our campaign in a language thatÃ¢ÂÂs spoken by so many families across the country.

I donÃ¢ÂÂt speak Spanish perfectly. But I picked up what I could while working with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras. I took the skills I learned as a boy, working in my fatherÃ¢ÂÂs ironworking shop, and I put them to use in the village of El Progreso, teaching young people carpentry and metalwork.

That experience changed my life, and I have carried it with me ever since, in every position IÃ¢ÂÂve held Ã¢ÂÂ civil rights lawyer, city councilman, mayor, lieutenant governor, governor, and senator.

What I learned in Honduras comes down to three things: Fe, familia y trabajo duro. Those were also the values I learned in my Irish-Catholic family in Kansas City. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs one other basic belief that Hillary and I share: Do all the good you can and serve one another. ItÃ¢ÂÂs pretty simple.

And today, I recognize those same values in every state in our nation, by people of all skin colors, religions and backgrounds. And in this campaign, itÃ¢ÂÂs been inspiring to see people from across our country coming together to address the challenges we face.

I believe that God has created a beautiful and rich tapestry in our country, an incredible cultural diversity that succeeds when we embrace everybody in love and battle back against the dark forces of division.

Presidential elections are always a choice between two visions for our countryÃ¢ÂÂ¦ a choice between two candidates.

But this year itÃ¢ÂÂs a little bit different. ItÃ¢ÂÂs about America looking in the mirror and deciding what we see there.

This isnÃ¢ÂÂt just a question of a presidentÃ¢ÂÂs temperament and experience, although those are very important qualities. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs really on the ballot is Hillary ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂstronger togetherÃ¢ÂÂ vision versus Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs frightening and divisive vision for our country.

So today, I wanted you to hear directly from me, that under a Clinton-Kaine Administration, everyone will have a place in America.

Latinos have always shaped this countryÃ¢ÂÂ¦ From your service in the military, to your spirit of entrepreneurshipÃ¢ÂÂ¦ to your presence

on the Supreme Court.

And by 2050, communities of color will represent the majority of our population. So of course Latinos will help shape the future of America because you are the future of America.

Todos somos americanos.

We need all Americans, from all backgrounds, to help write the next chapters in our nationÃ¢ÂÂs story Ã¢ÂÂ just as you have always done. This community has been part of a long struggle that has shown your resilience and your power.

In recent years, many of those battles have been waged right here in Arizona. In many ways, Phoenix was one of the birthplaces of the modern immigrant rights movement, when people from all over the country came to organize against SB1070 Ã¢ÂÂ a bill that went against so many of our shared values.

That battle isnÃ¢ÂÂt overÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Right now, in this election, you are all leading the way in the next phase of progress. But weÃ¢ÂÂre up against some pretty tough opponents.

One of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs biggest supporters, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, whoÃ¢ÂÂs facing criminal charges for profiling Latinos and has persecuted undocumented immigrants. He says he thinks Trump will get Ã¢ÂÂa lot of Hispanic votes.Ã¢ÂÂ

Do you think heÃ¢ÂÂs right?

Just the other day, your former governor, Jan Brewer, who signed into law the discriminatory SB1070 that promoted racial profiling, said that she wasnÃ¢ÂÂt worried about her candidate, Donald Trump, winning this state, because, as she said, Latinos Ã¢ÂÂdonÃ¢ÂÂt get out and vote.Ã¢ÂÂ

Do you think sheÃ¢ÂÂs right?

I think Jan Brewer must not be paying very close attention. Because

millions of Americans are coming together Ã¢ÂÂ Democrats and Republicans and Independents Ã¢ÂÂ to support Hillary Clinton and reject Donald Trump and everything he stands for.

Here in Arizona, our campaign is surging. More than a million people have already voted early, and the rate of Hispanic voters has nearly doubled compared to four years ago. We are also seeing the same energy from the Latino community in early vote in states like Florida, Nevada, North Carolina and other states.

So I hate to break it to the Trump campaign, but Latinos are going to have a really big voice in this electionÃ¢ÂÂ¦ And the choice is really clear.

On the one hand, you have Hillary Clinton. Someone whoÃ¢ÂÂs spent her entire life working on behalf of kids and families. She started her career at an organization that fights for children and their families, at the ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Defense Fund. Registering Latino voters in South Texas and fought; fighting for universal healthcare and equal rights. In other words, sheÃ¢ÂÂs lista. Hillary Clinton is lista.

On the other hand, you have Donald Trump. Someone who thinks Ã¢ÂÂLatino outreachÃ¢ÂÂ means tweeting out a picture of a taco bowl.

In the first weeks of his campaign, Donald Trump said that immigrants from Mexico are drug dealers, rapists, murderers. In the last debate, Trump referred to them as Ã¢ÂÂbad hombres.Ã¢ÂÂ

He insists that Ã¢ÂÂthis is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.Ã¢ÂÂ He doesnÃ¢ÂÂt understand that multilingual and bilingual families contribute to the diversity that makes our nation strong.

He once called Alicia Machado, the winner of his Miss Universe pageant, Ã¢ÂÂMiss HousekeepingÃ¢ÂÂ¦Ã¢ÂÂ And a month ago, he decided to pick a fight with her on Twitter and in interviews for days.

And he attacked Gonzalo Curiel Ã¢ÂÂ the distinguished judge in the fraud lawsuit against Trump University. Now, Judge Curiel was born in Indiana. His parents were born in Mexico. But Donald actually said Judge Curiel canÃ¢ÂÂt be trusted to do his job because of his Ã¢ÂÂMexican heritage.Ã¢ÂÂ

Even the Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, who has endorsed Trump, said that was the Ã¢ÂÂdefinition of a racist comment.Ã¢ÂÂ

Judge Curiel is as American as I am. And heÃ¢ÂÂs as American as Donald Trump.

Whether your family just arrived or has been here since before the United States even existedÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Hillary Clinton and I believe we are brothers and my sisters, and we will be your champions.

YouÃ¢ÂÂre our neighbors, colleagues, friends and families. You make our nation stronger, smarter, and more creative. And I want all of you to know that we see you, and we are with you.

America is a better country because of you.

Hillary and I have a positive vision for what we want to accomplish.

You know, when Hillary first called me up and told me she had chosen me to be her running mate, hereÃ¢ÂÂs what she saidÃ¢ÂÂ¦

The definition of success in a Clinton-Kaine Administration wonÃ¢ÂÂt be the number of laws we pass, but whether we can make life a little easier for a working mother, or help a child learn better in a classroom, or help a person whoÃ¢ÂÂs made a mistake get a second chance. At that moment, I knew we were going to be soul mates in this journey.

Hillary and I are making two major promises for the first 100 days of our administration.

First, weÃ¢ÂÂll make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. We need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And I donÃ¢ÂÂt need to tell anyone here that we still have some work to do to get there.

Latinos are 17 percent of our countryÃ¢ÂÂs population, but they hold only 2 percent of its wealth. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs just not right. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to connect more Latinos with good jobs that pay good wagesÃ¢ÂÂ¦ with more opportunities to go to college, launch new ventures, and build wealth that you can pass on to your kids.

One of the keys to that is small business. Hillary and I are two kids of two fathers who built small businesses, and we know need to do much more to support the Latino-owned small businesses that create so many jobs across America. Our plan will make it easier to start one, increase access to capital, and invest $25 billion in the communities that need it most.

And at a time when education is more important than ever for the jobs of the future, weÃ¢ÂÂll fight for universal pre-school, good schools in every ZIP code, and make sure no one has to give up on their dreams of college because they canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to pay.

Over the last 20 years, the number of Latinos going to college has tripled. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs great news. And yet, Latinos are still less likely than their white peers to graduate Ã¢ÂÂ often because they canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to.

Our plan will help change that. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to make community college

free. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to make in-state public universities debt-free. And for families making less than $125,000 a year, weÃ¢ÂÂll completely eliminate tuition at those schools. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs how we can start to break down all the economic barriers that are holding you back.

Second, Hillary and I will introduce legislation for comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship.

Too many children in America say goodbye to their parents every morning, not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home.

Donald Trump wants to create a deportation nation. Trump wants to deport almost 16 million people. He wants to deport 11.5 million

undocumented people. And he wants to eliminate citizenship for 4.5 million people who were born in the United States to parents without documents undocumented parents and deport them as well.

This goes against one of the most important values in our Constitution Ã¢ÂÂ a person born here in the United States is a citizen. Hillary and I will fight against TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs divisive plan with all of our efforts.

One of my favorite things to do is go to the naturalization services where people become U.S. citizens.

Usually, after the oath is taken, thereÃ¢ÂÂs an open microphone, and people get to walk up and explain why they decided to become a citizen. Their stories just bring tears to your eyes and a smile to your face when you hear what they think about the greatness of the United States of America.

You canÃ¢ÂÂt help but think: Cualquier persona que ama tanto a los Estados Unidos merece estar aquÃÂ­.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why weÃ¢ÂÂre going to fight so hard for comprehensive immigration reform, and in the meantime, weÃ¢ÂÂll do everything we can to keep families together.

A few months ago, the Supreme Court put DAPA on hold. That was devastating for millions of families. But itÃ¢ÂÂs important to note that the Court didnÃ¢ÂÂt actually rule on the substance of the case. Hillary and I have always said that DAPA is squarely within the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs authority, and we will keep fighting for it.

We also need to end family detention, close private detention facilities, and stop the raids and round-ups. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre not right. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre not necessary. And theyÃ¢ÂÂre not consistent with our values.

I want to close by explaining why Hillary and I believe that weÃ¢ÂÂre stronger together. ItÃ¢ÂÂs something that has always united Democrats. WeÃ¢ÂÂre not just looking out for ourselves, weÃ¢ÂÂre people who look out for those among us that need help.

In my church, we talk about the story of the Good Samaritan. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs somebody whoÃ¢ÂÂs beaten up and lying at the side of the road. And a lot of people walk on by Ã¢ÂÂ people who should know better, people who are leaders, people who have titles. They just walk on by. I bet somebody walked on by and said, Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre a loser.Ã¢ÂÂ

But then a Samaritan, who in that story was sort of an outcast, says IÃ¢ÂÂm going to go help him out.

Today, there are a lot of people in this country who on the side of the road asking for help. Maybe they need a job, or need to figure out how to pay for college. Maybe theyÃ¢ÂÂre struggling with an illness, or are a victim of violence. Maybe theyÃ¢ÂÂre being bullied, or theyÃ¢ÂÂre just somebody who needs a second chance.

TheyÃ¢ÂÂre all there, by the side of the road, asking for help.

Hillary Clinton and I believe that we canÃ¢ÂÂt just walk on by. Democrats donÃ¢ÂÂt walk on by. Arizonans donÃ¢ÂÂt walk on by. Americans donÃ¢ÂÂt walk on by.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs just not who we are. We go over and help. And if we want this country to remain a place where we are measured by how we help others, then we need every single person here to vote. And we need you to bring your friends, and families, and neighbors to vote too.

For the first time in a while, the state of Arizona is competitive Ã¢ÂÂ and every single vote counts. Tomorrow is the last day of early voting in ArizonaÃ¢ÂÂ¦ But why wait until then when everyone can vote today!

Early voting is open until tomorrow. The nearest early voting location is the Maryvale-Cartwright School District Annex Building, at 3401 North 67th Avenue.

This election isnÃ¢ÂÂt just about where weÃ¢ÂÂre going. ItÃ¢ÂÂs about who we are.

I think weÃ¢ÂÂre a country where we all belong. A country that chooses love over hate. A country that builds on the progress weÃ¢ÂÂve made instead of going backward. That, as we used to say in Honduras, goes adelante, no atrÃÂ¡s.

And to anyone who says that we canÃ¢ÂÂt realize that vision, letÃ¢ÂÂs reply with the chant that has echoed through our history:

Si, se puede!

Gracias, Phoenix. LetÃ¢ÂÂs go vote. And letÃ¢ÂÂs go win."	0

472	"Ã¢ÂÂThe immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,Ã¢ÂÂ George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. Ã¢ÂÂThis kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally itÃ¢ÂÂs not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the presidentÃ¢ÂÂ¦ is pretty unusual.Ã¢ÂÂ

As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, heÃ¢ÂÂs made his displeasure clear.

Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was Ã¢ÂÂheartenedÃ¢ÂÂ by the protests following TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs attempts to repeal it.

At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. Ã¢ÂÂI expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,Ã¢ÂÂ Obama said Sunday.

And on Monday, ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking FlynnÃ¢ÂÂs security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about FlynnÃ¢ÂÂs erratic nature.

George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. Ã¢ÂÂI consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,Ã¢ÂÂ Bush said in an interview with Ã¢ÂÂTodayÃ¢ÂÂ in February. Ã¢ÂÂWe need an independent media to hold people like me to account.Ã¢ÂÂ

As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. Ã¢ÂÂI am for an immigration policy thatÃ¢ÂÂs welcoming and upholds the law,Ã¢ÂÂ Bush said.

Carter also voiced concerns after TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the womenÃ¢ÂÂs movement would be Ã¢ÂÂinvigoratedÃ¢ÂÂ by Trump and that he didnÃ¢ÂÂt see Ã¢ÂÂany glimmer of hopeÃ¢ÂÂ from the administration on race and gender issues.

Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessmanÃ¢ÂÂs presidential campaign, didnÃ¢ÂÂt mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. Ã¢ÂÂHe doesnÃ¢ÂÂt know much,Ã¢ÂÂ Clinton said in late December. Ã¢ÂÂOne thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.Ã¢ÂÂ

George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.

Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.

Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but thatÃ¢ÂÂs not really unprecedented,Ã¢ÂÂ Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. Ã¢ÂÂIf it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new.Ã¢ÂÂ

Current and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, CarterÃ¢ÂÂs chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.

Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂYou donÃ¢ÂÂt try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.Ã¢ÂÂ

While in office, former presidents occasionally turn to their predecessors for guidance. Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.

Ã¢ÂÂMost of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,Ã¢ÂÂ Mack McLarty, ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs former chief of staff, said.

For example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.

Others primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake.

Ã¢ÂÂWhat would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,Ã¢ÂÂ Naftali said. Ã¢ÂÂIf we see that none of the former presidents want anything to do with the Trump administration, that would be a first in the modern history of the American presidency.Ã¢ÂÂ

All in all, most presidents have made an effort to remain engaged socially with their predecessors. Clinton and H.W. Bush are particularly close despite their hard-fought 1992 election, with Clinton tweeting pictures of the two in April.

But Trump is no normal president. Trump, who rose politically for questioning the legitimacy of his predecessor, at first appeared to have forged a working relationship with Obama, receiving advice both in person and over the phone. Obama even said he was Ã¢ÂÂencouragedÃ¢ÂÂ by their first post-election meeting.

Trump has since leveled unfounded wiretapping accusations against Obama, and the president abruptly ended a recent interview with CBSÃ¢ÂÂ John Dickerson after Dickerson pressed him on his comments about Obama.

Ã¢ÂÂHe was very nice to me, but after that, weÃ¢ÂÂve had some difficulties,Ã¢ÂÂ Trump said before referencing his debunked wiretapping allegation and saying that the alleged wiretapping was Ã¢ÂÂinappropriate.Ã¢ÂÂ

Former President Barack Obama speaks at a community event on the Presidential Center at the South Shore Cultural Center, Wednesday, May 3, 2017, in Chicago. The Obama Foundation unveiled plans for the former president's lakefront presidential center, showcasing renderings and a model at an event where former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were expected to give more details. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)

Historically speaking, TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs relationship with the living former presidents is more fraught than any of his predecessorsÃ¢ÂÂ had been, Laura Belmonte, a presidential historian at Oklahoma State University, said. Ã¢ÂÂThat one I think may be a category where Trump is on his own,Ã¢ÂÂ she said

And Trump hasnÃ¢ÂÂt shied away from criticizing those who came before him. As president, Trump called Obama a Ã¢ÂÂbad (or sick) guy!Ã¢ÂÂ as part of his debunked wire-tapping claim. He called George W. Bush Ã¢ÂÂnot niceÃ¢ÂÂ during the campaign, said the Bush administration Ã¢ÂÂliedÃ¢ÂÂ about the Iraq War and called Bill Clinton Ã¢ÂÂthe WORST abuser of women in U.S. political history.Ã¢ÂÂ

George H.W. Bush and Carter werenÃ¢ÂÂt excluded from TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs slights. Ã¢ÂÂEnough is Enough- No More Bushses!Ã¢ÂÂ Trump tweeted during the campaign. He alsocriticized Carter as unpresidential for carrying his own luggage.

Steven Hochman, an aide to Carter at the Carter Center who helped the 92-year-old former president write his memoirs, said Carter hopes he and his center will be able to work with the Trump administration.

And Carter hasnÃ¢ÂÂt always seized opportunities to knock Trump. The former president appeared with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Monday to discuss human rights, and Ã¢ÂÂ while revealing that he voted for Sanders Ã¢ÂÂ Carter said the Ã¢ÂÂdownturnÃ¢ÂÂ of human rights Ã¢ÂÂpreceded 2016.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂPresident Carter, I think he hopes that he wonÃ¢ÂÂt need to speak out but I would assume that if there were something he needed to say, he would say it,Ã¢ÂÂ Hochman said. Ã¢ÂÂActually, IÃ¢ÂÂm sure he would.Ã¢ÂÂ

Both Bushes are more focused on their nonprofit work than engaging in politics, said Samuel Skinner, who served as the senior BushÃ¢ÂÂs chief of staff. HeÃ¢ÂÂs spoken to both since the inauguration, and neither has mentioned Trump.

Ã¢ÂÂThey may have personal opinions, but theyÃ¢ÂÂre not going to express them,Ã¢ÂÂ Skinner said. Ã¢ÂÂBoth 41 and 43 are very measured people, so I think theyÃ¢ÂÂve been both very cautious about what they say.Ã¢ÂÂ

McLarty, ClintonÃ¢ÂÂs former chief of staff, predicted his former boss will continue to weigh in on the politics of the day. Ã¢ÂÂI wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be surprised at all if he expresses serious differences of opinion on economic, domestic and international policies,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

Getting seriously involved in politics is a no-win scenario for former presidents, Skinner said, adding that the legacies of the former presidents are being shaped by historians, not todayÃ¢ÂÂs events in Washington.

Ã¢ÂÂI think any time and energy they have could be better spent working in nonprofits and their libraries,Ã¢ÂÂ he said."	1

474	"MAYADIN, SYRIA - Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, released a statement Wednesday confirming that ISIS would be immediately surrendering its fight to establish a powerful caliphate after viewing an interview in which pop singer Katy Perry said, ""The greatest thing we can do just unite and love on each other and like, no barriers, no borders, like, we all need to just co-exist.""

The powerful statement which single-handedly dismantled ISIS came shortly after a terrorist attack on civilians in Manchester killed 22 people, and led the reclusive head of ISIS to hold an emergency press conference declaring the group's jihad finished.

""Despite my previous belief that we must slay the infidel in the name of Allah until Islam rules the world, I just can't deny that Katy's words have touched my heart,"" al-Baghdadi said as he symbolically held up and then tossed an AK-47 onto the ground. ""It is time for the mujahideen to start uniting and loving on people.""

""I just can't believe we didn't see it before. It's all so clear now,"" he added.

After the video started to go viral in ISIS cave networks and strongholds, thousands of terrorists began pouring out into the streets of Mayadin, giving one another spontaneous group hugs, destroying their weapons, and planting trees and flowers in an attempt to begin rebuilding the Middle East into a utopian wonderland.

According to reports, al-Baghdadi further confirmed that a recent advertisement in which Kendall Jenner offered a group of riot police a Pepsi was also influential in his decision to immediately cease their murderous reign of terror and lead ISIS down a path of peace."	1
475	"August 1, 2010 Ã¢ÂÂ -- AMANPOUR: Madam Speaker, thank you so much for joining me.

PELOSI: My pleasure.

AMANPOUR: Can I ask you about some of the important news that's been made this week, particularly in -- in the House and that would be on Afghanistan.

Last year, 32 Democrats voted against the funding of the war in Afghanistan. This year, 102 Democrats voted against. That seems to be a dramatic rejection from the president's own party of his major strategic goal.

PELOSI: Well, not quite. You have to put the votes in perspective.

Our president came in. He was president maybe two months, three months, by the time we took the vote last year. And the Republicans said they weren't going to vote for the funding. And so it took all Democratic votes.

I persuaded my members to give this president a chance, to give him room in order to have time to implement his plan. And in -- and in the course of time -- now the Republicans said they would vote for it, it gave my members the freedom to express themselves on the war in Afghanistan.

AMANPOUR: Now, you didn't vote.

PELOSI: No.

AMANPOUR: I know the speaker doesn't have to vote.

PELOSI: Right.

AMANPOUR: But how would you have voted?

PELOSI: Well, we brought the bill to the floor. And that was a statement that said that we knew that our troops needed to have what was -- what they needed to have would be provided for them. So we will never abandon our men and women in uniform. On the other hand, it gave our members a chance to express their view.

AMANPOUR: How long do you think you can keep your skeptical members, as you call them, on side?

PELOSI: Well, again, we have a -- varying degrees of expression here. We are there, we've taken an oath to defend the constitution and therefore the American people. And that's what people will be looking at -- how does this figure into our protecting the American people?

Is it worth it?

AMANPOUR: Well, is it worth it?

PELOSI: Yes.

AMANPOUR: Is it worth it?

PELOSI: That's the question.

AMANPOUR: But that's my question to you.

PELOSI: Well, we will -- as I said, we will see the metrics as they unfold in the next few months and certainly by the end of this year.

AMANPOUR: But what does your gut tell you?

PELOSI: in my visits to afghanistan, the last time i was there was over mother's day weekend to visit the troops///and the four metrics that we have always used year in and year out on these visits have been about security. And the military tells us this cannot be won militarily solely.

Secondly, governance and ending corruption.....

AMANPOUR: I'm just trying to figure out, for instance, you know, what you think is the right thing to do in Afghanistan at the moment. Look, ""Time"" magazine, this week, has this as its cover -- a girl whose had her nose and ears cut off by the Taliban.

You know, to put it right down to its basics, is America going to abandon the women of Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan again?

PELOSI: Well, first of all, we're in Afghanistan because it's in our strategic national interests to be so for our own national security, to stop terrorism, to increase global security. The women of Afghanistan have been a priority for many of the women in Congress -- and men, too, but the women have taken a special interest.

When I was there in -- around Mother's Day, I went to a province in Southern Afghanistan and visited with women.

And we talked about the education of their children, the health of women and the rest. And they -- especially their daughters.- they said we want that, but that can't happen without security. And these women in this remote province told us and that can't happen without the end of corruption.

So what we would like to see is for President Karzai be a more reliable, a stronger partner, ending the corruption, increasing -- improving the governance

AMANPOUR: Vice President Biden, talking about the dead line for the transition, which is summer of 2011, he said on this program a week or two ago that there's going to be a drawdown of forces

BIDEN SOT---""it could be as few as a couple thousand troops it could be more. but there will be a transition""

Does that square with -- with what you think, that it could just be a couple of thousand troops?

PELOSI: Well, I hope it is more than that. I know it's not going to be turn out the lights and let's all go home on one day. But I do think the American people expect it to be somewhere between that and a -- a few thousand troops.

AMANPOUR: Let's go to something much closer to home right now at the moment and that is the ethics conundrum with Representative Rangel.

How does your affection and your respect for him as a colleague square with what's going on right now and what you said and declared, that this is going to be the -- the -- the most ethical Congress ---- that you're going to drain the swamp of any kind of wrongdoing and corruption, etc.?

PELOSI: When I came in, I said we're draining the swamp. And we did. We have passed the most sweeping ethics reform in the history of the Congress. Any personal respect and affection we may have for people makes us sad about the course of events, but we have to pull the high ethical standard and none of our personalities is more important than that.

AMANPOUR: Can you see Congressman Rangel ever returning as chairman of the Ways and Means or in any position of leadership in -- in the House?

PELOSI: Well, the -- the Ethics Committee is working its will and

AMANPOUR: No matter what happens?

PELOSI: it's an elementary discussion, because what we have done is to wait and see what the Committee decides. I respect what they do. I'm totally out of the loop. It is independent. It is confidential, classified, secret, whatever. We don't know what it is. But we do respect the work that the members of the Committee do.

AMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the mid-term elections. You are, by all accounts, one of the most -- if not the most -- powerful and successful speakers of -- in the history of the United States. You've passed so much legislation. The president was elected with a significant majority.

You had control of both houses of Congress. And yet now, people are talking about you might lose your majority in the House. The gap seems to be growing wider between what's achieved and what's making an impact with the people. How did this happen?

PELOSI: Well, that's one version of the story. And --

476	"At a campaign town hall event at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Sen. Marco Rubio used a question on abortion from a reporter to focus on Hillary Clinton, claiming she is the one with Ã¢ÂÂradicalÃ¢ÂÂ positions. Perhaps trying to show Rubio is out of step with voters on abortion, he was asked whether a fertilized egg should have legal protections, the candidate used the question as an opportunity to defend life and vigorously attacked the Democrat frontrunner.

Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt know what youÃ¢ÂÂre talking Ã¢ÂÂ I believe all life is worthy of the protection of our laws. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what I believe,Ã¢ÂÂ declared Rubio. Rubio, 44, is the youngest candidate in the Republican field, and has consistently declared he will defend life at all stages of conception, regardless of circumstances. Ã¢ÂÂI believe it is outrageous that Hillary Clinton supports partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome process thatÃ¢ÂÂs been outlawed in the United States, but she supports it as a process that should be legal,Ã¢ÂÂ Rubio asserted.



Taking another question from the audience, Rubio also took the opportunity to discuss rape victims by revealing he would Ã¢ÂÂput rape victims into custody and under strict supervision if it is determined that they are planning to have an abortion.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm just totally against the whole shebang, I wonÃ¢ÂÂt deny it,Ã¢ÂÂ Rubio said. Ã¢ÂÂI am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. I mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what itÃ¢ÂÂs father has done to you, come on.Ã¢ÂÂ

He added: Ã¢ÂÂThat is why I believe that all rape victims should be put into protective custody where they would be given full-time round the clock care so that they could recover. However, I also feel that these people must be under the watchful eye of trained professionals, who would be in charge of determining whether or not the ones who got pregnant are planning to have an abortion, and of course, stopping them before things get out of control.Ã¢ÂÂ

Asked how soon such a plan could be put in action, Rubio replied: Ã¢ÂÂDonÃ¢ÂÂt know yet, first thingÃ¢ÂÂs first here. I need to start by winning the election in order to be able to change this country for the better.Ã¢ÂÂ/SOURCE

477	"Republican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their Ã¢ÂÂanatomical sex:Ã¢ÂÂ

Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.

He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but itÃ¢ÂÂs hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the studentÃ¢ÂÂs rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.

481	"Michelle Wolf has landed a show of her own.

After nearly half a decade working on Late Night With Seth Meyers and The Daily Show With Trevor Noah, Wolf is set to host her own weekly show on Netflix. The streaming giant, which is making a considerable push in the talk-show space with entries from David Letterman and Joel McHale, is billing WolfÃ¢ÂÂs show as a break from the seriousness of late-night comedy. The planned star vehicle will launch later this year.

The 32-year-old rising star, whose show does not yet have a name, is expected to make fun of everything and everybody, with no preaching or political agenda Ã¢ÂÂ unless, of course, itÃ¢ÂÂs funny. Ã¢ÂÂYou can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldnÃ¢ÂÂt do on TV,Ã¢ÂÂ Wolf joked in a statement, with NetflixÃ¢ÂÂs vp content Bela Bajaria, adding more earnestly: Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre thrilled to be working with Michelle, a gifted writer and performer with a singular voice.Ã¢ÂÂ

The announcement comes some two months after Wolf earned raves for her first stand-up special, Nice Lady, which aired on rival HBO. The special gave Wolf her highest-profile platform to date to tackle subjects ranging from feminism (Ã¢ÂÂI want equal pay! And a chardonnayÃ¢ÂÂ) to dating and other social issues.

Though Wolf is still a relative fresh face on the stand-up circuit, she has already earned the respect of several comedic heavyweights, or former heavyweights, including Louis C.K., who tapped her to open for him on his 2016 stand-up tour and to act in his celebrated web show Horace and Pete, and Chris Rock, who hired her to write for his Oscars ceremony.

By jumping to Netflix, Wolf marks the latest star to exit Comedy Central Ã¢ÂÂ and in her case, as it was for predecessors like John Oliver, just as her career is taking off. In addition to her contributor duties on the cable networkÃ¢ÂÂs Daily Show, Wolf created and starred in two digital series, Now Hiring and Used People, for the Viacom network.

Looking ahead, WolfÃ¢ÂÂs Netflix show, a rare and much-welcomed female-fronted series in what is still a male-dominated space, will be produced via her Cats in Pants banner. Dan Powell (Inside Amy Schumer) and Christine Nangle (The PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs Show, The Mick) will serve as co-showrunners, with her manager Daniel Bodansky joining them as an executive producer.

Wolf is repped by UTA, Dixon Talent and Hansen Jacobson; Powell is with UTA, Odenkirk Provissiero and Hansen Jacobson; and Nangle is repped by UTA and Jackoway Tyerman."	1

11:27 A.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning, everybody. Lately, IÃ¢ÂÂve been speaking a lot about our need for an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy -- a strategy that produces more oil and gas here at home, but also produces more biofuels and fuel-efficient cars, more solar power and wind power and other sources of clean, renewable energy.

This strategy is not just the right thing to do for our long-term economic growth; itÃ¢ÂÂs also the right way for us to reduce our dependence on foreign oil right now. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the right way for us to put people to work right now. And ultimately, itÃ¢ÂÂs the right way to stop spikes in gas prices that weÃ¢ÂÂve put up [with] every single year -- the same kind of increase that weÃ¢ÂÂve seen over the past couple of months.

Obviously rising gas prices means a rough ride for a lot of families. Whether youÃ¢ÂÂre trying to get to school, trying to get to work, do some grocery shopping, you have to be able to fill up that gas tank. And there are families in certain parts of the country that have no choice but to drive 50 or 60 miles to get to the job. So when gas prices go up, itÃ¢ÂÂs like an additional tax that comes right out of your pocket.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs one of the reasons we passed a payroll tax cut at the beginning of this year and made sure it extended all the way through this year, so that the average American is getting that extra $40 in every paycheck right now.

But I think everybody understands that there are no quick fixes to this problem. There are politicians who say that if we just drilled more then gas prices would come down right away. What they donÃ¢ÂÂt say is that we have been drilling more. Under my administration, America is producing more oil than at any time in the last eight years. WeÃ¢ÂÂve opened up new areas for exploration. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some.

But as I've said repeatedly, the problem is we use more than 20 percent of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs oil and we only have 2 percent of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs proven oil reserves. Even if we drilled every square inch of this country right now, weÃ¢ÂÂd still have to rely disproportionately on other countries for their oil. That means we pay more at the pump every time thereÃ¢ÂÂs instability in the Middle East, or growing demand in countries like China and India.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening right now. ItÃ¢ÂÂs those global trends that are affecting gas prices. So even as we're tackling issues of supply and demand, even as we're looking at the long-term in terms of how we can structurally make ourselves less reliant on foreign oil, we still need to work extra hard to protect consumers from factors that should not affect the price of a barrel of oil.

That includes doing everything we can to ensure that an irresponsible few arenÃ¢ÂÂt able to hurt consumers by illegally manipulating or rigging the energy markets for their own gain. We can't afford a situation where speculators artificially manipulate markets by buying up oil, creating the perception of a shortage, and driving prices higher -- only to flip the oil for a quick profit. We canÃ¢ÂÂt afford a situation where some speculators can reap millions, while millions of American families get the short end of the stick. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not the way the market should work. And for anyone who thinks this cannot happen, just think back to how Enron traders manipulated the price of electricity to reap huge profits at everybody elseÃ¢ÂÂs expense.

Now, the good news is my administration has already taken several actions to step up oversight of oil markets and close dangerous loopholes that were allowing some traders to operate in the shadows.

We closed the so-called Enron loophole that let traders evade oversight by using electronic or overseas trading platforms. In the Wall Street reform law, we said for the first time that federal regulators will make sure no single trader can buy such a large position in oil that they could easily manipulate the market on their own. So IÃ¢ÂÂd point out that anybody whoÃ¢ÂÂs pledging to roll back Wall Street reform -- Dodd-Frank -- would also roll back this vital consumer protection along with it.

IÃ¢ÂÂve asked Attorney General Holder to work with Chairman Leibowitz of the Federal Trade Commission, Chairman Gensler of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other enforcement agencies to make sure that acts of manipulation, fraud or other illegal activity are not behind increases in the price that consumers pay at the pump.

So today, weÃ¢ÂÂre announcing new steps to strengthen oversight of energy markets. Things that we can do administratively, we are doing. And I call on Congress to pass a package of measures to crack down on illegal activity and hold accountable those who manipulate the market for private gain at the expense of millions of working families. And be specific.

First, Congress should provide immediate funding to put more cops on the beat to monitor activity in energy markets. This funding would also upgrade technology so that our surveillance and enforcement officers arenÃ¢ÂÂt hamstrung by older and less sophisticated tools than the ones that traders are using. We should strengthen protections for American consumers, not gut them. And these markets have expanded significantly.

Chairman Gensler actually had a good analogy. He said, imagine if the NFL quadrupled the number of teams but didnÃ¢ÂÂt increase the number of refs. YouÃ¢ÂÂd end up having havoc on the field, and it would diminish the game. It wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be fair. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs part of whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on in a lot of these markets. So we have to properly resource enforcement.

Second, Congress should increase the civil and criminal penalties for illegal energy market manipulation and other illegal activities. So my plan would toughen key financial penalties tenfold, and impose these penalties not just per violation, but for every day a violation occurs.

Third, Congress should give the agency responsible for overseeing oil markets new authority to protect against volatility and excess speculation by making sure that traders can post appropriate margins, which simply means that they actually have the money to make good on their trades.

Congress should do all of this right away. A few weeks ago, Congress had a chance to stand up for families already paying an extra premium at the pump; congressional Republicans voted to keep spending billions of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars on more unnecessary subsidies for big oil companies. So here's a chance to make amends, a chance to actually do something that will protect consumers by increasing oversight of energy markets. That should be something that everybody, no matter their party, should agree with. And I hope Americans will ask their members of Congress to step up.

In the meantime, my administration will take new executive actions to better analyze and investigate trading activities in energy markets and more quickly implement the tough consumer protections under Wall Street reform.

Let me close by saying none of these steps by themselves will bring gas prices down overnight. But it will prevent market manipulation and make sure we're looking out for American consumers. And in the meantime we're going to keep pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy to break the cycle of price spikes year after year. We are going to keep producing more biofuels; we're going to keep producing more fuel-efficient cars; we are going to keep tapping into every source of American-made energy.

And these steps have already helped put America on a path to greater energy independence. Our foreign -- our dependence on foreign oil has actually decreased each year I've been in office -- even as the economy has grown. America now imports less than half of the oil we use for the first time in more than a decade. So we are less vulnerable than we were, but we're still too vulnerable.

We've got to continue the hard, sustained work on this issue. And as long as I'm President we're going to keep placing our bets on America's future -- America's workers, America's technology, America's ingenuity, and American-made energy. That's how we're going to solve this problem once and for all.

Thank you very much, everybody.

484	Stephen Colbert takes on cable news pundits (and everyone else) in this political satire.	0
485	"This is well outside WonkblogÃ¢ÂÂs normal bailiwick, but if nothing else, Sen. Rand PaulÃ¢ÂÂs (R-Ky.) filibuster against CIA director nominee John Brennan Ã¢ÂÂ launched as a protest against the administrationÃ¢ÂÂs drone policy, which Brennan has steered for the past four years Ã¢ÂÂ uncovered a hunger for a broader conversation on the topic. So what does the drone program actually entail, and why are Paul and others criticizing it?

What is a drone?

Technically called Ã¢ÂÂunmanned aerial vehiclesÃ¢ÂÂ (UAVs), drones are just aircraft without human pilots onboard, encompassing everything from reconnaissance vehicles to unmanned crop dusters. In common parlance, though, Ã¢ÂÂdroneÃ¢ÂÂ has come to refer to unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), which are UAVs equipped with combat capabilities, most commonly the ability to launch missiles.

How long has the U.S. government been using them?

The General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, the most famous UCAV in the U.S. arsenal, first saw combat in 1995 as part of the NATO intervention in Bosnia, but at that time was solely a reconnaissance tool and carried no payload. On Feb. 16, 2001, the Predator #3034 became the first to be successfully fitted with a Hellfire missile, and to fire it in a trial flight. Predators were deployed to Afghanistan almost immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and on Oct. 7, 2001 they conducted their first armed mission there.

In addition to the Predator, the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, a larger UCAV capable of carrying a higher payload, has seen service starting in 2007. The current program is jointly administered by the CIA and the Joint Special Operation Command (JSOC).

Where do we send them?

Primarily Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. According to a Washington Post database, compiled with the help of the New America Foundation and Long War Journal, strikes in Pakistan have been occurring since 2004 and picked up in pace starting in summer 2008. Apart from a November 2002 strike in Yemen, the Somalia and Yemen campaigns began in 2011. There have been reports of strikes in the Philippines, though information there is sketchy.

Additionally, drones have seen service in Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq as part of the Unites StatesÃ¢ÂÂs more traditional military campaigns in those countries.

How powerful is a drone attack?

Predator drones can carry up to two Hellfire missiles. Those have warheads of about 20 pounds, which are designed to pierce tank armor; their damage outside of the vehicle targeted is limited. An alternative warhead, which manufacturer Lockheed Martin touts as featuring Ã¢ÂÂhigh lethality and minimum collateral damage,Ã¢ÂÂ also is in service.

Reapers are another story. They feature a maximum payload of 3,000 pounds, or 1.5 tons. That means they can carry a combination of Hellfires and larger 500 pound bombs like the GBU-12 Paveway II and GBD-38 JDAM. Those have an Ã¢ÂÂeffective casualty radiusÃ¢ÂÂ of about 200 feet. That means that about 50 percent of people within 200 feet of the blast site will die. Those odds improve Ã¢ÂÂ or worsen, depending on how you look at it Ã¢ÂÂ the closer you get, obviously.

So imagine if you took a football field and shrunk it by a third. A Reaper attacks one endzone with a GBU-12. If youÃ¢ÂÂre on the field, you have a 50 percent chance of dying. Update: I apparently forgot the distinction between yards and feet since middle school. Corrected.

How many drone attacks have we launched to date?

According to the Post database, there have been 347 in Pakistan, 53 in Yemen and 2 in Somalia. From 2008 through October 2012, there were 1,015 strikes in Afghanistan, 48 in Iraq, and at least 105 in Libya according to the Bureau for Investigative Journalism. That does not include strikes in Libya past September 2011, strikes from 2001 to 2007 in Iraq and Afghanistan, and those since October 2012. The New York TimesÃ¢ÂÂ Mark Mazzetti reported that at least one strike has happened in the Philippines.

What sort of people have we targeted?

Primarily al-Qaeda and its affiliates. That includes al-Shaabab in Somalia, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (which works in Yemen), and the Haqqani Network in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Philippines strike was intended to kill Umar Patek, a leader of the Indonesian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah who helped orchestrate the 2002 attacks in Bali that killed 95 people. Patek is now serving a 20-year sentence in Indonesia.

Have we killed U.S. citizens this way?

WeÃ¢ÂÂve killed four, at least. Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born al-Qaeda operative in Yemen, was killed in a drone strike in 2011, as was his American-born 17-year-old son (in a subsequent strike) and Samir Khan, a North Carolina native who died in the same strike as the elder al-Alaki. Ahmed Hijazi, also an American citizen based in Yemen, was killed in 2002. Note: paragraph updated to correct spelling of al-AwlakiÃ¢ÂÂs name and include Hijazi.

To clarify the Obama administrationÃ¢ÂÂs exact policy on killing Americans without a trial, Eric Holder wrote the following letter to Sen. Rand Paul: Ã¢ÂÂDear Senator Paul: It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: Ã¢ÂÂDoes the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?Ã¢ÂÂ The answer to that question is no.Ã¢ÂÂ The dispatch followed an earlier, more equivocal note from Holder on the subject, which seemed to indicate Holder believes the president has the authority to kill U.S. citizens on U.S. soil if he judges them a threat.

How many people have died in drone attacks?

Sen. Lindsey Graham estimated the death toll of the Pakistan/Somalia/Yemen program at 4,700. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs higher than most estimates; Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations puts the number at closer to 3,500.

How many of those were civilians?

Cora Currier at ProPublica helpfully compiled a number of estimates in January. New America puts the civilian death total in Pakistan and Yemen between 276 and 368, of which 118-135 were under the Bush administration. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism puts the number between 446 and 978, increasing to 993 if you include Somalia. Of those, 179 to 209 were children, BIJ estimates. A Stanford/NYU study suggests that the strikes have inflicted considerable psychological trauma on residents of Pakistan, and deterred relief workers from serving areas targeted. Funerals and rescue workers have been targeted in past strikes.

WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the process for deciding when and where to launch them?

As my colleague Greg Miller has reported, the administration uses something called the Ã¢ÂÂdisposition matrixÃ¢ÂÂ to determine targets for drone strikes. Miller describes it as a Ã¢ÂÂsingle, continually evolving database in which biographies, locations, known associates and affiliated organizations are all cataloged. So are strategies for taking targets down, including extradition requests, capture operations and drone patrolsÃ¢ÂÂ¦The database is meant to map out contingencies, creating an operational menu that spells out each agencyÃ¢ÂÂs role in case a suspect surfaces in an unexpected spot.Ã¢ÂÂ

The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) will prepare lists of potential targets, which will be reviewed every three months by a panel of intelligence analysts and military officials. They are then passed along to a panel at the National Security Council, currently helmed by CIA director nominee Brennan, and then to Obama for final approval. The criteria for addition to the list are determined personally by Obama, who also must personally approve all strikes outside Pakistan. Pakistan strikes are approved by the CIA director.

WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the case for using drones?

ThereÃ¢ÂÂs some political science to suggest that Ã¢ÂÂdecapitation strikes,Ã¢ÂÂ like these drone attacks, are actually quite effective at reducing the ability of terrorist groups to operate effectively. The RAND CorporationÃ¢ÂÂs Patrick Johnston and UCLAÃ¢ÂÂs Anoop Sarbahi have found preliminary evidence that the drone program specifically is effective at degrading the operations of targeted groups. Zack Beauchamp has a good overview of this literature here.

But thatÃ¢ÂÂs a case for strikes, not for drone strikes specifically. There is, however, substantial evidence that the percentage of casualties borne by civilians is much lower with drone strikes than with just about any other kind of military intervention, even if one accepts high estimates of the percent of killed who are civilians.

Is Congress kept in the loop?

To some degree. As part of BrennanÃ¢ÂÂs confirmation process, Senate Intelligence Committee members were granted access to Justice Department memos justifying the use of drones, and a similar white paper was shared last year. The Committee and its House counterpart are also allowed to review individual strikes, including the intelligence behind them and video obtained during their commission. But they have not tried to limit the program in any way. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt know that weÃ¢ÂÂve ever seen anything that we thought was inappropriate,Ã¢ÂÂ one Congressional aide told the Los Angeles Times.

How about the courts?

Nope. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) has proposed establishing a specialized court to approve drone strikes based on FISA courts that approve surveillance of suspected foreign intelligence in the U.S., but that is, for now, just an idea. Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under Obama, has called for an oversight board placed within the executive branch.

Is this legal?

The Justice Department certainly thinks so, though the reasons why are classified, and lawsuits to expose them have proven unsuccessful. The clearest window weÃ¢ÂÂve gotten into their reasoning as relates to the killing of U.S. citizenscomes from a white paper leaked to NBC News last month. It derives the authority for the strikes from the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed in the wake of 9/11, which grants the government broad powers against al-Qaeda. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs more, the white paper argues that drone strikes somehow donÃ¢ÂÂt run afoul of Executive Order 12333, the ban on assassinations as a tool of policy that has existed since the Ford administration, as they are used for Ã¢ÂÂself-defense.Ã¢ÂÂ See also BrennanÃ¢ÂÂs speech here defending the program more broadly.

Administration critics arenÃ¢ÂÂt impressed, with the ACLUÃ¢ÂÂs Jameel Jaffeer noting the white paper, Ã¢ÂÂargues that the government has the right to carry out the extrajudicial killing of an American citizen.Ã¢ÂÂ

Does it violate international law?

The Justice Department memo cites the UN Charter, which allows states to make war in the interest of self-defense, an interest also invoked by Brennan. Critics, like UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, summary or arbitrary executions Christof Heyns, say that this defense is a stretch, and the killings plainly run afoul of the laws of war and international human rights treaties.

Are other countries using drones this way?

Only the United States and the United Kingdom (which assists in the Pakistan drone effort) currently use drones in combat, but many other countries have acquired drone technology, including China, Russia, India, Iran and Israel. The U.K. uses Reapers and Predators while most other countries use the Israeli Aerospace Industries Heron or similar Israeli models. Drones saw combat use in Israel during the Gaza war of late 2008. Even Hezbollah has acquired reconnaissance drones. All told, the GAO estimates that 76 countries, at least, have drone technology.

What do our allies think about it?

European allies other than Britain generally refrain from using drones to attack al-Qaeda, but frequently share intelligence that assists the drone program in selecting targets.

What about the countries where we send drones? What do they think?

TheyÃ¢ÂÂre very mad. The Pakistani government has condemned the drone strikes as a violation of sovereignty, though thereÃ¢ÂÂs evidence theyÃ¢ÂÂre tacitly allowing the strikes to happen. The Yemeni government quietly agreed to the strikes, though murmurs of opposition have emerged of late. Citizens in both countries deplore the campaigns.

Is it actually weakening al-Qaeda?

New America estimates that 1,967 Ã¢ÂÂ 3,236 militants were killed in Pakistan and Yemen, meaning the overwhelming majority of casualties were intended targets. That said, the share of deaths who were Ã¢ÂÂhigh-profile targetsÃ¢ÂÂ was 11 percent under Obama and 33 percent under Bush according to New America. And there are deeper doubts as to whether the strategy is recruiting more militants than it kills, by turning local populations against the United States. The attempted Times Square bomber, for instance, cited drones as a motivating force.

It could also be a bad idea even if it is weakening al-Qaeda. Many have noted that the money spent on anti-terrorism efforts might save more lives if devoted to tackling more mundane threats, like auto accidents.

LetÃ¢ÂÂs get the conversation going on how we can fight poverty and expand opportunity in America. Join Senator Tim Scott and I as we moderate a forum on fighting poverty with Republican presidential candidates in Columbia, S.C., hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation. Follow along here and on Twitter with #KempForum16.

I just wanted to say a few words about why weÃ¢ÂÂre here today. And one reason why IÃ¢ÂÂm here is that my mentor was Jack Kemp. There was no issue he was more passionate about than poverty.

So I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt think of a better host than the foundation that bears his name. Jack was the greatest champion of the American Idea, and he knew the fight against poverty is vital to renewing that idea in the 21st century.

WeÃ¢ÂÂve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now. And I donÃ¢ÂÂt think you can call it anything but a stalemate. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And yet today, if you were raised poor, youÃ¢ÂÂre just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago.

IÃ¢ÂÂm not saying we havenÃ¢ÂÂt made progress. We have. But today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty Ã¢ÂÂ that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves. So, what is the problem?

It is our strategy. Most of us think poverty is about deprivation Ã¢ÂÂ or not having enough money.

We treat empty wallets like potholes. Fill them up and move on. So for the past 50 years, weÃ¢ÂÂve created over 80 different programs to fill over 80 different holes in peopleÃ¢ÂÂs budgets: health care,child care, energy, education Ã¢ÂÂ with almost no coordination among them.

HereÃ¢ÂÂs the catch: You qualify for these programs based how much you make. So if you donÃ¢ÂÂt make much, you get a lot of benefits. But as you work and make more, you start to lose benefits.

And because weÃ¢ÂÂve piled these programs right on top of each other, the falloff is steep. Make a little more, and youÃ¢ÂÂll lose a ton. So we think weÃ¢ÂÂve been filling holes. But weÃ¢ÂÂve actually been building a trap. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs because poverty is about more than deprivation; itÃ¢ÂÂs about isolation.

There are many different kinds of poverty. But what a lot of them share in common is, people are cut off from the community. They donÃ¢ÂÂt have the support they need to grow, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs a counselor, or a teacher, or a boss.

What they need is someone they can trust, someone who can help them learn new skills. And by discouraging work, the federal government is isolating the poor.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we are here today. We as a country are not winning this war, and we conservatives have something to offer. I believe if we apply our principles to this challenge, we can come up with real solutions. DonÃ¢ÂÂt just treat the symptoms of poverty. Get at the root causes of poverty.

DonÃ¢ÂÂt measure success based on inputs. Measure the results.

And this, to me, is the biggest conservative insight: The answer is not the money in Washington.

It is the people in our communities Ã¢ÂÂ the people with credibility. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre the ones who can break through. And IÃ¢ÂÂm not saying just cut money for the safety net. IÃ¢ÂÂd say spend the same amount of money we do now Ã¢ÂÂ because this isnÃ¢ÂÂt about saving money; itÃ¢ÂÂs about saving lives.

What IÃ¢ÂÂm saying is, donÃ¢ÂÂt minimize; customize. Take the money weÃ¢ÂÂre spending now and direct it to homegrown solutions. Design aid to fit each personÃ¢ÂÂs needs. And whatever you do,encourage work Ã¢ÂÂ because thatÃ¢ÂÂs how people reconnect with their community. Once they find their niche and put down roots, they draw strength from the people around them, and they grow.

TheyÃ¢ÂÂll not only have enough money; theyÃ¢ÂÂll be able to make enough money to get off assistance.

The way I see it, the federal government is the rearguard; it should direct the supply lines. But the people in our communities Ã¢ÂÂ theyÃ¢ÂÂre the vanguard; they should fight poverty on the front lines.

Now, I know a lot of people are wondering, Ã¢ÂÂWhy do you care about this? YouÃ¢ÂÂre Republicans.Ã¢ÂÂ

I remind them, Ã¢ÂÂWell, weÃ¢ÂÂre Americans too.Ã¢ÂÂ We all believe in the American Idea: The condition of your birth doesnÃ¢ÂÂt determine the outcome of your life.

If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. If you made a mistake, you can redeem yourself.

But a lot of people donÃ¢ÂÂt think thatÃ¢ÂÂs true anymore. And we have to be honest with ourselves: If the American Idea is not true for everybody, then it is not true at all. So we all should care about poverty because it is a direct challenge to who we are.

And itÃ¢ÂÂs not enough to pay your taxes and think, Ã¢ÂÂGovernment is going to take care of this.Ã¢ÂÂ We all have to get involved.

And I know itÃ¢ÂÂs easy to get discouraged. But what IÃ¢ÂÂve learned is, there are thousands of people beating poverty every day. The solutions are out there; theyÃ¢ÂÂre already working. We just have to support them. We just have to find them. And more often than not theyÃ¢ÂÂre right under our noses . . . in our communities . . . all over America.

So I look forward to hearing from all our candidates and learning more about how we can build a more prosperous, a more secure, and a more confident America."	0

488	"May 23, 2010 Ã¢ÂÂ -- TAPPER: Hello again. Joining me now, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Tim Kaine, and the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele. Gentlemen, welcome.

KAINE: Hey, Jake, good to be with you.

STEELE: Jake, good to see you.

TAPPER: I want to get to the general election results in a second, but first, I want to bear in on a couple of controversies we have, and I'm going to start with you, Mr. Steele.

STEELE: OK.

TAPPER: I don't know if you were expecting (ph) that or not--

STEELE: Kind of.

(LAUGHTER)

TAPPER: The Kentucky Senate candidate, Rand Paul, has expressed his objections philosophically to the federal government being able to tell businesses that they cannot discriminate. Here's Rand Paul.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

RAND PAUL, SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, R-KY.: I like the Civil Rights Act in a sense that it ended discrimination in all public domains. I abhor racism. I think it's a bad business decision to ever exclude anybody from your restaurant. But at the same time, I do believe in private ownership.

There's ten different titles, you know, to the Civil Rights Act. One deals with private institutions, and had I been around, I would have tried to modify that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TAPPER: Chairman Steele, you have worked so hard to bring minorities into the Republican Party. Here is a Senate candidate saying that he doesn't think the government, philosophically, should be able to tell a business that they can't -- that they have to serve you.

STEELE: Right, right.

TAPPER: Do you have an issue with that?

STEELE: Well, I do, and I think it's important to understand that Rand Paul has clarified his statement and has reiterated his support for and, you know, movement towards pushing civil rights forward as opposed to going backwards, number one.

Number two, our party has always had a strong view on this issue. We fought very hard in the '60s to get the civil rights bill passed as well as the voting rights bill. So I think that, you know, any -- any, you know, attempted look backwards, it's not in the best interests of our country, certainly, and certainly not in the best interests of the party.

So, you know, I've talked to Rand. He and I are on the same page. Our party stands four-square about moving forward on civil rights. Looking at the civil rights issues of the day -- education, for example -- there are many other fights that loom ahead for us in this area, so Rand Paul as United States senator will be four-square with the Republican Party, in lockstep with moving forward on civil rights, not looking backwards.

TAPPER: Chairman Kaine, this is traditionally a Republican seat. Do these views of Rand Paul make this seat more competitive in your mind?

KAINE: Absolutely, they do, Jake. Of course, it starts with our candidate, Jack Conway, who's the attorney general, I think he's going to run a great race. But Rand Paul's views on this, his statement this week that he thinks it's un-American for President Obama to try to hold British Petroleum accountable for the spill in the Gulf--

TAPPER: Let's talk about that. What do you think about that?

STEELE: Well, I mean, our own speaker of the House referred to American citizens as un-American, so I think referring to a policy which he did not say it was un-American per se. He said going in that direction could be an un-American--

TAPPER: We have -- we actually have the video clip. Let's watch that.

(CROSSTALK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PAUL: What I don't like from the president's administration is this sort of, you know, I'll put my boot heel on the throat of BP, and I think it's part of this sort of blame game society in the sense that it's always got to be someone's fault, instead of the fact that maybe sometimes accidents happen.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TAPPER: Certainly, accidents happen is not what you want the Republican response about the BP oil spill--

STEELE: Well, you know, well, look, I mean, it's not -- people shouldn't worry about the Republican response to the BP oil spill. They should worry about the Democrat president's response to the BP oil spill. It is one thing to actually get on the ground and get in front of this thing. It's another thing to sit back and hold BP accountable without helping them, and that's what's happening here. I mean, the federal government should have stepped into this thing immediately, to help make sure that the appropriate steps are being taken by BP, all federal agencies in support of the state government to try to get this thing cleaned up. And here we are, almost a month and a half later, and it's still spilling oil.

TAPPER: How about that, Chairman Kaine? A lot of Democrats are criticizing the Obama administration for not doing enough to hold BP accountable.

KAINE: The administration is doing two things. It starts with BP's accountability, and Rand Paul is wrong. It isn't un-American to hold somebody accountable for a massive environmental disaster of this kind. This isn't just a mistake that we can wash away. BP has got to be accountable for stopping the spill and then cleaning up and paying for the consequences. The administration has had a team working with BP from the very beginning trying to look at ways to help them do it, but it is BP's job. They have to be held accountable, and saying that it's just a mistake that needs to be washed away, or saying, as Rand Paul did, for example, that, you know, we needn't be so worried about things like mining regulations -- I mean, this is a very important role that the government has, to protect the safety of the environment and the health of its citizens. And so, Rand Paul's statements along these lines are very, very troubling, and it's important for Republican leaders to say whether they back this kind of an attitude or not."	0
489	"Republican Senator Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes sit on opposite sides of the debate about the role of money in U.S. elections.A deluge of campaign cash is playing a significant role in Kentucky's Senate race thus far.The money raised by the campaigns and outside groups is expected to top the $100 million mark and go down as the most expensive in U.S. history.More than any lawmaker, McConnell is the face of looseningÃ¢ÂÂif not, eliminatingÃ¢ÂÂcampaign finance regulations.For over a decade the GOP leader has espoused that money and free speech are synonymous. He has filed legal briefs urging the Supreme Court to reaffirm its Citizens United decision and supports a controversial case to further deregulate contribution limits placed on individuals.In a March 17 e-mail to supporters, Grimes took a strong stance against the influence wealthy donors are having and calls out McConnell as the chief architect and beneficiary of that system.""Special interest money has already flooded into Mitch McConnellÃ¢ÂÂs campaign,"" Grimes said. ""HeÃ¢ÂÂs the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle and his Karl Rove-affiliated Super PACs are clogging the Commonwealth's airwaves with negative attack ads. Enough is enoughÃ¢ÂÂour democracy is too important to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.""Grimes has played it safe on the campaign trail when faced with thornier issues outside of core Democratic principles, such as raising the minimum wage. But given the left's apoplectic reaction to the Roberts Court's dismantling limitations and the rise of super PACs, her position is receiving applause from watchdog groups.""It's very good that Alison Grimes has come out in support of a policy that puts regular people in charge of government again,"" says David Donnelly, who is executive director of Public Campaign Action Fund. ""She understands that money in politics drowns out the voices of every day Kentuckians. This is a sharp difference between her and McConnell, someone who is advocating the make the problem worse.""The Grimes campaign message also directs voters to sign a petition calling on Congress to ""stop special interest billionaires,"" that has the support of red state Democratic senators such as Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.In the 2014 election cycle, there are almost 1,000 registered super PACs that have generated over $141 million and spent more than $24.8 million on races.According to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, the pro-McConnell super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership is among the ranks among the top ten groups in this year's races.Democrats and liberal activists decrying the influence of money in politics have themselves pointed out its limitations in Kentucky's Senate race.McConnell has spent over half of the $20 million he's raised this cycle and he has a number of outside groups spending millions in advertisements supporting his re-election. Yet McConnell's approval ratings remain terribly low and Grimes either leads or ties the GOP leader in most polling.Former FEC Chairman Michael Toner says despite arguments that the wealthy are purchasing American elections, those independent expenditure committees haven't always worked out for candidates.""One reason the federal courts over the years have not found a corruption threat at the independent spending is that sometimes it's not that effective in directly advancing a candidate's interest,"" he says.""A lot of candidates who spend more money than their opponents whether out of their own pocket or let's say supported by major outside groups, their track record in winning elections is not that good to be honest. We've seen a lot of multi-millionaire candidates who are defeated in various races. Now to be sure some are also elected, but by now means is the candidate with the most money spent on their behalf assured of being elected.""Grimes has raised $4.5 million since entering the race last year and been all over the country at fundraisers with big name Democratic donors. She outpaced McConnell's money machine during the third quarter and Democratic-affiliated groups have also spent money attacking McConnell in television ads.The McConnell campaign was quick to point out that while Grimes is criticizing Citizens United, she is also benefiting from attack ads against the senator from outside liberal groups who praise her position.""Like Barack Obama, Alison Lundergan Grimes is obviously much more concerned with political convenience than Constitutional protections,"" McConnell campaign spokeswoman Allison Moore told WFPL. ""The sad part is that she apparently sees no irony in the fact the special interest group who successfully persuaded her to embrace trampling on our First Amendment rights in the name of money in politics is the same one running hundreds of thousands of dollars of advertising on her behalf.""The top expenditures in 2014 have been super PACs with liberal viewpoints such as Senate Majority PAC, which has slammed McConnell in TV ads.Asked about Grimes' wealthy donors, Donnelly says all elected officials and candidates are implicated but that what lawmakers do in Washington matters.""The real distinction is what are you going to do to clean it up and propose pro-actively to make the system better,"" he says. ""And on that score voters know in Alison Grimes they have someone who is going to champion the issue and that in Mitch McConnell who is going to make the problem worse."""	0

TG-162 Treasury Announces $68 Billion in Expected CPP Repayments WASHINGTON Ã¢ÂÂ The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced today that 10 of the largest U.S. financial institutions participating in the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) have met the requirements for repayment established by the primary federal banking supervisors. Following consultation with the primary banking supervisor of each institution, Treasury has notified the institutions that they are now eligible to complete the repayment process. If these firms choose to do so, Treasury will receive $68 billion in repayment proceeds. Combined with repayments received to date from other institutions, Treasury will have received approximately $70 billion in repayments from CPP participants. More than 600 banks across the country have participated in the CPP, representing $199 billion in investments. ""These repayments are an encouraging sign of financial repair, but we still have work to do,"" said Secretary Tim Geithner. These repayments follow a period in which many banks have successfully raised equity capital from private investors. Also, for the first time in many months, these banks have issued long-term debt that is not guaranteed by the government. Under the CPP investment agreements, firms that repay their preferred stock have the right to repurchase the warrants Treasury holds in their firms at fair market value. In addition to Treasury's potential income from sale of the warrants, these 10 institutions have already paid dividends on the preferred stock totaling approximately $1.8 billion over the last seven months. Dividend payments received for all CPP participants are approximately $4.5 billion to date. Under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, proceeds from repayment will be applied to Treasury's general account. These repayments help to reduce Treasury's borrowing and national debt. The repayments also increase Treasury's cushion to respond to any future financial instability that might otherwise jeopardize economic recovery.

Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton face off in a high-stakes debate, Thursday night. more photos ÃÂ»

CNN's CAMPBELL BROWN: And the candidates have taken their seats. We are ready to get started. On behalf of CNN, Univision and the candidates, we want to thank our hosts, the University of Texas and the LBJ School and Library.

And now I want to give you an idea of what to expect over the next 90 minutes or so. We want to have a real conversation between these two candidates on the issues important to Texas and the entire nation, so we won't have any hard and fast rules for them to follow. We simply ask the candidates to keep their answers to a reasonable length and to stay on point.

And we have given the candidates the opportunity to make opening statements. The order was determined by a draw. Senator Obama won the draw and elected to go second.

So please go ahead, Senator Clinton.

SEN. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, thank you.

And I am just delighted to be back here in Austin. You know, nearly 36 years ago I came to Austin for my very first political job, and that was registering voters in south Texas. And I had the great privilege of living for a while in Austin and in San Antonio, and meeting people and making friends that have stayed with me for a lifetime.

And I found that we had a lot in common, a lot of shared values, a belief that hard work is important, that self-reliance and individual responsibility count for a lot.

CLINTON: And among the people whom I got to know, who became not only friends, but heroes, were Barbara Jordan, who taught me a lot about courage, and today...

(APPLAUSE)

...would actually be her birthday. I remember all the time about how she got up every single morning, facing almost insurmountable odds, to do what she did.

And another was my great friend Ann Richards, who taught me so much...

(APPLAUSE)

... about determination. Ann was a great champion for the people of Texas. She also reminded us that every so often it is good to have a laugh about what it is we're engaged in.

And as I think back on those years and the work that I've done ever since, you know, for me politics is about making real differences in people's lives. I am very, very proud that over these years I have been able to make a difference in the lives of people in Texas, Ohio and elsewhere.

CLINTON: You know, 350,000 children in Texas get health care every month because I helped to start the Children's Health Insurance Program.

(APPLAUSE)

And 21,000 National Guard and Reserve members get access to health care because I went across the party line and joined up with a Republican senator to make that happen.

So there's a lot that we've already done. But there's so much more to do.

I want to take on the tough issues that face us now. I want to stop the health insurance companies from discriminating against people because they're sick. You know, it's unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race or gender or ethnic origin or religion, but it's OK to discriminate against sick people.

And we're going to end that, because it's time we said no more.

(APPLAUSE)

And I want to continue the work that I've done in the Senate to take care of our veterans.

CLINTON: It was shocking and shameful, what happened, that we discovered about a year ago at Walter Reed. We can do so much better, to take care of the people who've taken care of us.

And there is a lot of work ahead. I offer a lifetime of experience and proven results. And I know that, if we work together, we can take on the special interests, transfer $55 billion of all those giveaways and subsidies that President Bush has given them, back to the middle class, to create jobs and provide health care and make college affordable.

(APPLAUSE)

And I ask you -- I ask you to join in my campaign. It's now up to the people of Texas, Ohio, and the other states ahead.

So, if you'll be part of this campaign, which is your really your campaign, about your futures, your families, your jobs and your health care, we'll continue to make a difference for America.

Thank you all very much.

(APPLAUSE)

BROWN: Senator Clinton, thank you.

BROWN: Senator Obama?

(APPLAUSE)

SEN. BARACK OBAMA: First of all, thank you so much to the University of Texas for hosting us, and it's a great honor to share the stage once again with Senator Clinton. I've said before that we've been friends before this campaign started; we'll be friends afterwards, unified to bring about changes in this country.

You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is at war, and our economy is increasingly in shambles. And the families of Texas and all across America are feeling the brunt of that failing economy.

This week, I met a couple in San Antonio, who -- as a consequence of entering into a predatory loan -- are on the brink of foreclosure and are actually seeing them having to cut back on their medical expenses, because their mortgage doubled in two weeks.

OBAMA: I've met a young woman who gets three hours of sleep a night because she has to work the night shift even as she's going to school full time, and still can't afford to provide the health care for her sister who's ill.

In Youngstown, Ohio, talked to workers who have seen their plants shipped overseas as a consequence of bad trade deals like NAFTA, literally seeing equipment unbolted from the floors of factories and shipped to China, resulting in devastating job losses and communities completely falling apart.

And all across America I'm meeting not just veterans, but also the parents of those who have fallen.

One mother in Green Bay gave me this bracelet in memory of a 20- year-old son who had been killed in a roadside bomb, as a consequence of a war that I believe should have never been authorized and should have never been waged and has cost us billions of dollars that could have been invested here in the United States in roads and bridges and infrastructure and making sure that young people can go to college and that those who need health care actually get it.

OBAMA: Now, Senator Clinton...

(APPLAUSE)

... Senator Clinton and I have been talking about these issues for the last 13 months. We both offer detailed proposals to try to deal with them. Some of them are the same. Some we have differences of opinion.

But I think we both recognize that these problems have to be dealt with and that we have seen an administration over the last seven years that has failed to address them and -- in many ways -- has made them worse.

But understand that what is lacking right now is not good ideas.

OBAMA: The problem we have is that Washington has become a place where good ideas go to die. They go to die because the lobbyists...

(APPLAUSE)

They go to die because lobbyists and special interests have a strangle-hold on the agenda in Washington. They go to die in Washington because too many politicians are interested in scoring political points rather than bridging differences in order to get things done.

And so the central premise of this campaign is that we can bring this country together, that we can push against the special interests that have come to dominate the agenda in Washington, that we can be straight with the American people about how we're going to solve these problems and enlist them in taking back their government.

You know, Senator Clinton mentioned Barbara Jordan, somebody who was an inspiration to me and so many people throughout the country. And she said that what the American people want is very simple: They want an America that is as good as its promise.

OBAMA: I'm running for president because I want to help America be as good as its promise.

Thank you very much.

(APPLAUSE)

BROWN: All right, Senator Obama, thank you, and let's begin with questions.

Jorge Ramos?

UNIVISION's JORGE RAMOS: Thank you very much (SPEAKING IN SPANISH).

Thank you so much for being with us, and let me start with a little news. After nearly half a century in office, Fidel Castro resigned as the head of the Cuban government. Ninety miles off the coast of the United States, we might have a new opportunity.

The question for you, Senator Clinton: Would you be willing to sit down with Raul Castro, or whoever leads the Cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once, to get a measure of the man?

CLINTON: Well, Jorge, I hope we have an opportunity. The people of Cuba deserve to have a democracy. And this gives the Cuban government, under Raul Castro, a chance to change direction from the one that was set for 50 years by his brother.

I'm going to be looking for some of those changes: releasing political prisoner, ending some of the oppressive practices on the press, opening up the economy.

Of course the United States stands ready. And, as president, I would be ready to reach out and work with a new Cuban government, once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction.

I want to bring the region together, our European allies who have influence with Cuba, to try to push for some of those changes, and to make it very clear that, if Cuba moves toward democracy and freedom for its people, the United States will welcome that.

CLINTON: And as president, I would look for opportunities to try to make that happen and to create the momentum that might eventually lead to a presidential visit.

But there has to be evidence that indeed the changes are real; that they are taking place; and that the Cuban people will finally be given an opportunity to have their future determined by themselves.

RAMOS: Very simply, would you meet with him or not, with Raul Castro?

CLINTON: I would not meet with him until there was evidence that change was happening, because I think it's important that they demonstrate clearly that they are committed to change the direction. Then I think, you know, something like diplomatic encounters and negotiations over specifics could take place.

But we've had this conversation before, Senator Obama and myself, and I believe that we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate. But a presidential visit should not be offered and given without some evidence that it will demonstrate the kind of progress that is in our interest, and in this case, in the interests of the Cuban people.

BROWN: Senator Obama, just to follow up, you had said in a previous CNN debate that you would meet with the leaders of Cuban, Iran, North Korea, among others, so presumably you would be willing to meet with the new leader of Cuba.

OBAMA: That's correct. Now, keep in mind that the starting point for our policy in Cuba should be the liberty of the Cuban people. And I think we recognize that that liberty has not existed throughout the Castro regime. And we now have an opportunity to potentially change the relationship between the United States and Cuba after over half a century.

I would meet without preconditions, although Senator Clinton is right that there has to be preparation. It is very important for us to make sure that there was an agenda, and on that agenda was human rights, releasing of political prisoners, opening up the press. And that preparation might take some time.

But I do think that it's important for the United States not just to talk to its friends, but also to talk to its enemies. In fact, that's where diplomacy makes the biggest difference.

(APPLAUSE)

OBAMA: One other thing that I've said, as a show of good faith that we're interested in pursuing potentially a new relationship, what I've called for is a loosening of the restrictions on remittances from family members to the people of Cuba, as well as travel restrictions for family members who want to visit their family members in Cuba.

And I think that initiating that change in policy as a start and then suggesting that an agenda get set up is something that could be useful, but I would not normalize relations until we started seeing some of the progress that Senator Clinton was talking about.

BROWN: But that's different from your position back in 2003. You called U.S. policy toward Cuba a miserable failure, and you supported normalizing relations.

BROWN: So you've backtracked now...

OBAMA: I support the eventual normalization. And it's absolutely true that I think our policy has been a failure. I mean, the fact is, is that during my entire lifetime, and Senator Clinton's entire lifetime, you essentially have seen a Cuba that has been isolated, but has not made progress when it comes to the issues of political rights and personal freedoms that are so important to the people of Cuba.

So I think that we have to shift policy. I think our goal has to be ultimately normalization. But that's going to happen in steps. And the first step, as I said, is changing our rules with respect to remittances and with respect to travel.

And then I think it is important for us to have the direct contact, not just in Cuba, but I think this principle applies generally. I recall what John F. Kennedy once said, that we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate. And this moment, this opportunity when Fidel Castro has finally stepped down, I think, is one that we should try to take advantage of.

(APPLAUSE)

BROWN: Senator Clinton, do you want a quick response?

CLINTON: Well, I agree, absolutely, that we should be willing to have diplomatic negotiations and processes with anyone. I've been a strong advocate of opening up such a diplomatic process with Iran, for a number of years.

Because I think we should look for ways that we can possibly move countries that are adversarial to us, you know, toward the world community. It's in our interests. It's in the interests of the people in countries that, frankly, are oppressed, like Cuba, like Iran.

But there has been this difference between us over when and whether the president should offer a meeting, without preconditions, with those with whom we do not have diplomatic relations. And it should be part of a process, but I don't think it should be offered in the beginning. Because I think that undermines the capacity for us to actually take the measure of somebody like Raul Castro or Ahmadinejad and others.

CLINTON: And, as President Kennedy said, he wouldn't be afraid to negotiate, but he would expect there to be a lot of preparatory work done, to find out exactly what we would get out of it.

And therefore, I do think we should be eliminating the policy of the Bush administration, which has been very narrowly defined, and frankly against our interests, because we have failed to reach out to countries, we have alienated our friends, and we have emboldened our enemies.

So I would get back to very vigorous diplomacy, and I would use bipartisan diplomacy. I would ask emissaries from both political parties to represent me and our country, because I want to send a very clear message to the rest of the world that the era of unilateralism, preemption and arrogance of the Bush administration is over and we're going to...

(APPLAUSE)

BROWN: Very briefly and then we're going to move on.

(APPLAUSE)

OBAMA: I think, as I said before, preparation is actually absolutely critical in any meeting. And I think it is absolutely true that either of us would step back from some of the Bush unilateralism that's caused so much damage.

But I do think it is important precisely because the Bush administration has done so much damage to American foreign relations that the president take a more active role in diplomacy than might have been true 20 or 30 years ago.

Because the problem is, if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned, I think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time. And I think that it's important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years, for the president to be willing to take that extra step.

OBAMA: That is the kind of step that I would like to take as president of the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

BROWN: A question now on the economy.

John King?

CNN's JOHN KING: Campbell, Senators, good evening, first.

I want to bring the conversation back home. You know from your travels -- you don't need to look at the polls or anything else -- that the economy is by far now the dominant issue that voters want to hear about from the candidates.

For some, that is a question about: What should we do about an economy that is at the edge or perhaps in the early stages of a recession? For some, it is more focused. Maybe it is: Will you raise the minimum wage? Maybe it's about trade deals that they think leave them on the raw end, as you mentioned in your opening statement, Senator Obama.

But when we ask Democrats, ""How are these two candidates different?,"" they even think they don't know.

Senator Obama, beginning with you, tell us as specifically as you can, how would a President Obama be different than a President Clinton in managing the nation's economy?

OBAMA: Well, first of all, let me emphasize the point that you just made, which is: You don't need an economist or the Federal Reserve to tell the American people that the economy's in trouble, because they've been experiencing it for years now.

Everywhere you go, you meet people who are working harder for less, wages and incomes have flatlined, people are seeing escalating costs of everything from health care to gas at the pump.

And so people have been struggling for a long time. In some communities, they have been struggling for decades now. So this has to be a priority of the next president.

Now, what I've said is that we have to restore a sense of fairness and balance to our economy, and that means a couple of things.

Number one, with our tax code: We've got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas and invest those tax breaks in companies that are investing here in the United States of America.

(APPLAUSE)

We have to end the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy...

(APPLAUSE)

... and to provide tax breaks to middle-class Americans and working Americans who need them.

OBAMA: So I've said that if you are making $75,000 a year or less, I want to give an offset to your payroll tax that will mean $1,000 extra in the pockets of ordinary Americans. Senior citizens making less than $50,000, you shouldn't have to pay income tax on your Social Security.

We pay for these by closing tax loopholes and tax havens that are being manipulated.

(APPLAUSE)

On our trade deals, I think it is absolutely critical that we engaged in trade, but it has to be viewed not just through the lens of Wall Street, but also Main Street, which means we've got strong labor standards and strong environmental standards and safety standards, so we don't have toys being shipped in the United States with lead paint on them.

(APPLAUSE)

So these are all issues that I've talked about repeatedly, and I think there are also opportunities in our economy around creating a green economy. We send $1 billion to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil.

OBAMA: And for us to move rapidly to cap greenhouse gases, generate billions of dollars that we can reinvest in solar and wind and biodiesel -- that can put people back to work. So...

(APPLAUSE)

Now, I don't want to take too much time. And I'm sure we'll be spend more time discussing this.

Senator Clinton and I, I think, both agree on many of these issues. And I think it's a credit to the Democratic Party as a whole that the other candidates who were involved earlier on agreed with us on many of these issues.

I think that there is a real, solid agenda for moving change forward in the next presidency.

The question people are going to have to ask is: How do we get it done?

And it is my strong belief that the changes are only going to come about if we're able to form a working coalition for change. Because people who were benefiting from the current tax code are going to resist. The special interests and lobbyists are going to resist.

And I think it has to be a priority for whoever the next president is to be able to overcome the dominance of the special interests in Washington, to bring about the kinds of economic changes that I'm talking about.

OBAMA: And that's an area where Senator Clinton and I may have a slight difference. But I'm happy to let her speak first and then can pick up on anything that's been left out.

KING: Let's give Senator Clinton that opportunity then.

(APPLAUSE)

As you have campaigned, Senator, on this issue and others, but specifically on this issue, you have said, ""I am ready on day one to take charge of the economy.""

The clear implication, since you have one opponent at the moment, is that you're ready; he's not.

What would you do differently on day one than a President Obama would when it comes to managing the nation's economy?

CLINTON: Well, I would agree with a lot that Senator Obama just said, because it is the Democratic agenda.

CLINTON: We are going to rid the tax code of these loopholes and giveaways.

We're going to stop giving a penny of your money to anybody who ships a job out of Texas, Ohio or anywhere else to another country.

We're certainly going to begin to get the tax code to reflect what the needs of middle class families are so we can rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class.

You know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president the last seven years, and I think it's time that the rest of America had a president to work for you every single day.

(APPLAUSE)

We will also have a different approach toward trade.

We're going to start having trade agreements that not only have strong environmental and labor standards, but I want to have a trade time-out. We're going to look and see what's working and what's not working, and I'd like to have a trade prosecutor to actually enforce the trade agreements that we have before we enter into any others.

We're also going to put much tougher standards in place so that people cannot import toys with lead paint, contaminated pet food, contaminated drugs into our market. We're going to have much more vigorous enforcement of safety standards.

CLINTON: Now, in addition, there are steps I would take immediately. One is on this foreclosure crisis. I have been saying for nearly a year we had to crack down on the abusive practices of the lenders. But we also need a moratorium on home foreclosures.

Everywhere I go, I meet people who either have been or about to lose their home. 85,000 homes in foreclosure in Texas; 90,000 in Ohio. I've met the families: the hairdresser, the single mom who's going to lose her home, the postal worker who got really hoodwinked into an agreement that wasn't fair to him.

So I would put a moratorium for 90 days, to give us time to work out a way for people to stay in their homes, and I would freeze interest rates for five years. Because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, millions of Americans are going to be homeless. And vacant homes will be across the neighborhoods of Texas and America.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Now, in addition, there are three ways we need to jump start the economy.

Clean green jobs; I've been promoting this. I wanted it to be part of the stimulus package. I thought a $5 billion investment in clean green jobs would put hundreds of thousands of Americans to work helping to create our future.

We also need to invest in our infrastructure. We don't have enough roads to take care of the congestion, we have crumbling bridges and tunnels. We need to rebuild America, and that will also put people to work.

And, finally, we need to end George Bush's war on science, which has been waged against scientists and researchers...

(APPLAUSE)

BROWN: Thank you, Senator. And we've got a lot of ground to cover...

CLINTON: This is about how we fund the future. We've got to get back to being the innovation nation. Think of everything that goes on at this great university to create the new economy...

(APPLAUSE)

BROWN: All right. Senator Clinton, thank you very much.

BROWN: And, as I was saying, we've got a lot to get through. So I do want to shift gears and go on to another topic especially important here in Texas, which is immigration.

And, Jorge, you have a question.

RAMOS: (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Federal raids by immigration enforcement officials on homes and businesses have generated a great deal of fear and anxiety in the Hispanic community and have divided the family of some of the 3 million U.S.-born children who have at least one undocumented parent.

Would you consider stopping these raids once you take office until comprehensive immigration reform can be passed?

CLINTON: I would consider that, except in egregious situations where it would be appropriate to take the actions you're referring to.

But when we see what's been happening, with literally babies being left with no one to take care of them, children coming home from school, no responsible adult left, that is not the America that I know.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: That is against American values. And it is...

(APPLAUSE)

And it is a stark admission of failure by the federal government. We need comprehensive immigration reform. I have been for this. I signed onto the first comprehensive bill back in 2004. I've been advocating for it: tougher, more secure borders, of course, but let's do it the right way, cracking down on employers, especially once we get to comprehensive immigration reform, who exploit undocumented workers and drive down wages for everyone else.

I'd like to see more federal help for communities like Austin and others like Laredo, where I was this morning, that absorb the health care, education, and law enforcement costs.

And I personally, as president, would work with our neighbors to the south, to help them create more jobs for their own people.

Finally, we need a path to legalization, to bring the immigrants out of the shadows, give them the conditions that we expect them to meet, paying a fine for coming here illegally, trying to pay back taxes, over time, and learning English.

If they had a committed a crime in our country or the country they came from, then they should be deported. But for everyone else, there must be a path to legalization. I would introduce that in the first 100 days of my presidency.

(APPLAUSE)

BROWN: Senator Obama, is your position the same as Hillary Clinton's?

OBAMA: There are a couple of things I would add. Comprehensive immigration reform is something that I have worked on extensively.

Two years ago, we were able to get a bill out of the Senate. I was one of the group of senators that helped to move it through, but it died in the House this year. Because it was used as a political football instead of a way of solving a problem, nothing happened.

And so there are a couple of things that I would just add to what Senator Clinton said.

Number one, it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate, because there has been an undertone that has been ugly.

Oftentimes, it has been directed at the Hispanic community. We have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate as it has been conducted in Washington, and that is unacceptable.

We are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants, and we can reconcile those two things. So we need comprehensive reform...

(APPLAUSE)

... we need comprehensive reform, and that means stronger border security. It means that we are cracking down on employers that are taking advantage of undocumented workers because they can't complain if they're not paid a minimum wage.

OBAMA: They can't complain if they're not getting overtime. Worker safety laws are not being observed.

We have to crack down on those employers, although we also have to make sure that we do it in a way that doesn't lead to people with Spanish surnames being discriminated against, so there's got to be a safeguard there.

We have to require that undocumented workers, who are provided a pathway to citizenship, not only learn English, pay back taxes and pay a significant fine, but also that they're going to the back of the line, so that they are not getting citizenship before those who have applied legally, which raises two last points.

Number one, it is important that we fix the legal immigration system, because right now we've got a backlog that means years for people to apply legally.

(APPLAUSE)

And what's worse is, we keep on increasing the fees, so that if you've got a hard working immigrant family, they've got to hire a lawyer; they've got to pay thousands of dollars in fees. They just can't afford it. And it's discriminatory against people who have good character, we should want in this country, but don't have the money. So we've got to fix that.

OBAMA: So we've got to fix that.

The second thing is, we have to improve our relationship with Mexico and work with the Mexican government so that their economy is producing jobs on that side of the border.

And the problem that we have...

(APPLAUSE)

The problem that we have is that we have had an administration that came in promising all sorts of leadership on creating a U.S.- Mexican relationship. And, frankly, President Bush dropped the ball. He has been so obsessed with Iraq that we have not seen the kinds of outreach and cooperative work that would ensure that the Mexican economy is working not just for the very wealthy in Mexico, but for all people. And that's as policy that I'm going to change when I'm president of the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

BROWN: All right, Senator Obama.

We're going to stay with this topic. I want to have John King ask another question.

Go ahead, John.

KING: I want to stay on the issue, but move to a controversial item that was not held up when the immigration debate collapsed in Washington, and that is the border fence.

KING: To many Americans, it is a simple question of sovereignty and security. America should be able to keep people out that it doesn't want in.

But, as you know in this state, especially if you go to the south of here, along the border, and in other border states, to many people it's a much more personal question. It could be a question of their livelihood. It could be a question of cross-border trade. It might be an issue to a rancher of property rights. It might be a simple question of whether someone can take a walk or a short drive to see their family members.

Senator, back in 2006, you voted for the construction of that fence. As you know, progress has been slow.

As president of the United States, would you commit tonight that you would finish the fence and speed up the construction, or do you think it's time for a president of the United States to raise his or her hand and say, ""You know what? Wait a minute. Let's think about this again. Do we really want to do this?""

CLINTON: Well, I think both Senator Obama and I voted for that as part of the immigration debate.

CLINTON: And having been along the border for the last week or so -- in fact, last night I was at the University of Texas at Brownsville -- and this is how absurd this has become under the Bush administration. Because, you know, there is a smart way to protect our borders, and there is a dumb way to protect our borders.

(APPLAUSE)

And what I learned last night when I was there with Congressman Ortiz is that the University of Texas at Brownsville would have part of its campus cut off.

This is the kind of absurdity that we're getting from this administration. I know it because I've been fighting with them about the northern border. Their imposition of passports and other kinds of burdens are separating people from families, interfering with business and commerce, the movement of goods and people.

So what I've said is that I would say, wait a minute, we need to review this. There may be places where a physical barrier is appropriate.

I think when both of us voted for this, we were voting for the possibility that where it was appropriate and made sense, it would be considered. But as with so much, the Bush administration has gone off the deep end, and they are unfortunately coming up with a plan that I think is counterproductive.

CLINTON: So I would have a review. I would listen to the people who live along the border, who understand...

(APPLAUSE)

... what it is we need to be doing to protect our country.

(APPLAUSE)

BROWN: Let me go on, again -- John?

KING: Does that mean that you"	0

MRS. OBAMA: Oh, wow. (Applause.) Wow. It sounds like you all are already fired up and ready to go. (Applause.) This is amazing. It is truly amazing. And you know what, being here with all of you today, let me tell you, I'm feeling pretty fired up and ready to go myself. I really am. (Applause.)

But thereÃ¢ÂÂs a reason why we're here today --

AUDIENCE: I love you! (Applause.)

MRS. OBAMA: And we love you, too. And it's not just because we support one extraordinary man -- although, I'll admit, I'm a little biased because I think our President is awesome. (Laughter and applause.)

And it's not just because we want to win an election. We are here because of the values we believe in. We're here because of the vision for this country that we all share. We're here because we want all our children to have a good education, right? (Applause.) Schools that push them and inspire them, prepare them for good jobs. We want our parents and our grandparents to retire with dignity -- (applause) -- because we believe that after a lifetime of hard work, they should enjoy their golden years.

We want to restore that basic middle-class security for our families because we believe that folks shouldn't go bankrupt because they get sick. (Applause.) They shouldn't lose their home because someone loses a job. We believe that responsibility should be rewarded and hard work should pay off.

And truly, these are basic American values. They're the same values that so many of us were raised with, including myself. You see, my father was a blue-collar city worker at the city water plant. And my family lived in a little bitty apartment on the South Side of Chicago. And neither of my parents had the chance to go to college. But let me tell you what my parents did do: They saved. They sacrificed. I mean, they poured everything they had into me and my brother. They wanted us to have the kind of education they could only dream of. And while pretty much all of my college tuition came from student loans and grants, my dad still paid a little bitty portion of that tuition himself. And let me tell you, every semester, my dad was determined to pay that bill right on time because he was so proud to be sending his kids to college. (Applause.)

And he couldn't bear the thought of me or my brother missing that registration deadline because his check was late. Like so many people in this country, my father took great pride in being able to earn a living that allowed him to handle his responsibility to his family, to pay all of his bills and to pay them on time.

And truly, more than anything else, that is what's at stake. It's that fundamental promise that no matter who you are or how you started out, if you work hard, you can build a decent life for yourself and yes, an even better life for your kids. (Applause.)

And it is that promise that binds us together as Americans. It's what makes us who we are. And whether it's equal pay for women, or health care for our kids; whether it's tax cuts for middle-class families or student loans for our young people -- (applause) -- that is what my husband has been fighting for every single day as President. Every single day. (Applause.)

And let me tell you something -- as First Lady, I have had the chance to see up close and personal what being President looks like, right? I have seen how the issues that come across the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs desk are always the hard ones.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: YouÃ¢ÂÂre beautiful, Michelle! (Applause.)

MRS. OBAMA: But in all seriousness -- (laughter) -- these problems, theyÃ¢ÂÂre always the hard ones -- the problems with no clear solutions, the judgment calls where the stakes are so high and there is no margin for error. And as President, you can get all kinds of advice from all kinds of people. But at the end of the day, when it comes time to make that decision, all you have to guide you are your life experiences, your values, and your vision for this country. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs all you have. In the end, when youÃ¢ÂÂre making those impossible choices, it all boils down to who you are and what you stand for.

And we all know what Barack Obama is -- who he is. (Applause.) We all know what our President stands for, right? (Applause.) He is the son of a single mother who struggled to put herself through school and pay the bills. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs who he is. HeÃ¢ÂÂs the grandson of a woman who woke up before dawn every day to catch a bus to her job at the bank. And even though BarackÃ¢ÂÂs grandmother worked hard to help support his family, she was good at her job. Like so many women, she hit that glass ceiling. And men no more qualified than she was were promoted up the ladder ahead of her.

So believe me, Barack knows what it means when a family struggles. He knows what it means when someone doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have a chance to fulfill their potential. And what you need to know, America -- those are the experiences that have made him the man and the President he is today. (Applause.)

But I have said this before and will say it again and again: Barack cannot do this alone. And fortunately, he never has. We have always moved this country forward together. And today, more than ever before, Barack needs your help. He needs your help. He needs your help. (Applause.) He needs every single one of you -- every single one of you to give just a little part of your life each week to this campaign.

He needs you to register those voters. (Applause.) And to all of the college students out there, all of you -- if you're going to be moving over the summer, remember to register at your new address in the fall. You got that? Get that done. (Applause.)

Barack needs you to join one of our neighborhood teams and start organizing in your community. And just let me say, if there have ever been any doubt about the difference that you can make, I just want you to remember that in the end, this all could come down to those few thousand people who register to vote. Think about it. It could all come down to those last few thousand folks who get out to the polls on November the 6th.

And when you average that out over this entire state, it might mean registering just one more person in your town. It might mean helping just one more person in your community get out and vote on Election Day. So know this: With every door you knock on, with every call you make, with every conversation you have, I want you to remember that this could be the one that makes the difference. This could be the one. (Applause.) Remember that. That is exactly the kind of impact that each of you can have.

Now, I am not going to kid you. This journey is going to be long. And it is going to be hard. But know that that is how change always happens in this country. And if we keep showing up, if we keep fighting the good fight, then eventually we get there. We always do. Maybe not in our lifetimes, but maybe in our children's lifetimes, maybe in our grandchildren's lifetimes -- because in the end, that's what this is all about.

That is what I think about when I tuck my girls in at night. I think about the world I want to leave for them and for all of our sons and our daughters. I think about how I want to do for them what my dad did for me. I want to give them a foundation for their dreams. (Applause.) I want to give them opportunities worthy of their promise. I want to give them that sense of limitless possibility, that belief that here in America, there is always something better out there if you're willing to work for it. So we just cannot turn back now, right?

AUDIENCE: No!

MRS. OBAMA: We have come so far, but we have so much more to do. And if we want to keep on moving forward then we need to work our hearts out for the man that I have the pleasure of introducing here today. (Applause.) Are you ready?

It is my privilege to introduce my husband and our President, President Barack Obama!

THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Ohio! (Applause.) It is good to be back in Ohio! (Applause.) Right before I came out, somebody happened to give me a buckeye for good luck. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you!

THE PRESIDENT: I love you back! Now, before I begin, I want to say thank you to a few people who are joining us here today. Your mayor, Michael Coleman is here. (Applause.) Former Governor Ted Strickland is here. (Applause.) Senator Sherrod Brown is in the house. (Applause.) An American hero, John Glenn is with us. (Applause.)

And I want to thank so many of our Neighborhood Team Leaders for being here today. You guys will be the backbone of this campaign. (Applause.) And I want the rest of you to join a team or become a leader yourself, because we are going to win this thing the old-fashioned way -- door by door, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood. (Applause.)

Ohio, four years ago, you and I began a journey together.

I didnÃ¢ÂÂt run, and you didnÃ¢ÂÂt work your hearts out, just to win an election. We came together to reclaim the basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the most prosperous nation on Earth.

We came together because we believe that in America, your success shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be determined by the circumstances of your birth. If youÃ¢ÂÂre willing to work hard, you should be able to find a good job. If youÃ¢ÂÂre willing to meet your responsibilities, you should be able to own a home, maybe start a business, give your children the chance to do even better -- no matter who you are, or where you come from, or what you look like, or what your last name is. (Applause.)

We believe the free market is one of the greatest forces for progress in human history; that businesses are the engine of growth; that risk-takers and innovators should be rewarded. But we also believe that at its best, the free market has never been a license to take whatever you want, however you can get it; that alongside our entrepreneurial spirit and our rugged individualism, America only prospers when we meet our obligations to one another and to future generations. (Applause.)

We came together in 2008 because our country had strayed from these basic values. A record surplus was squandered on tax cuts for people who didnÃ¢ÂÂt need them and werenÃ¢ÂÂt even asking for them. Two wars were being waged on a credit card. Wall Street speculators reaped huge profits by making bets with other peopleÃ¢ÂÂs money. Manufacturing left our shores. A shrinking number of Americans did fantastically well, while most people struggled with falling incomes, rising costs, the slowest job growth in half a century.

It was ahouse of cards that collapsed in the most destructive crisis since the Great Depression. In the last six months of 2008, even as we were campaigning, nearly three million of our neighbors lost their jobs. Over 800,000 more were lost in the month I took office alone.

It was tough. But I tell you what, Ohio -- the American people are tougher. (Applause.) All across this country, people like you dug in. Some of you retrained. Some of you went back to school. Small business owners cut back on expenses, but did everything they could to keep their employees. Yes, there were setbacks. Yes, there were disappointments. But we didnÃ¢ÂÂt quit. We donÃ¢ÂÂt quit. Together, weÃ¢ÂÂre fighting our way back. (Applause.)

When some wanted to let Detroit go bankrupt, we made a bet on American workers, on the ingenuity of American companies. And today, our auto industry is back on top of the world. (Applause.) Manufacturers started investing again, adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. Businesses got back to the basics, exports surged. And over four million jobs were created in the last two years -- more than one million of those in the last six months alone. (Applause.) Are we satisfied?

AUDIENCE: No!

THE PRESIDENT: Of course not. Too many of our friends and family are still out there looking for work. The housing market is still weak, deficits are still too high, and states are still laying off teachers, first responders. This crisis took years to develop, and the economy is still facing headwinds. And it will take sustained, persistent effort -- yours and mine -- for America to fully recover. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the truth. We all know it.

But we are making progress. And now we face a choice. (Applause.) Now we face a choice, Ohio.

CHILD: We love you, Barack Obama!

AUDIENCE: Awww --

THE PRESIDENT: (Laughter.) Thank you. Now we face a choice. For the last few years, the Republicans who run this Congress have insisted that we go right back to the policies that created this mess.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: But to borrow a line from my friend Bill Clinton, now their agenda is on steroids. (Applause.) This time, they want even bigger tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. This time, they want even deeper cuts to things like education and Medicare, and research and technology.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: This time, they want to give banks and insurance companies even more power to do as they please. And now, after a long and spirited primary, Republicans in Congress have found a nominee for President who has promised to rubber-stamp this agenda if he gets the chance.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: Ohio, I tell you what: We cannot give him that chance. (Applause.) Not now. Not with so much at stake. This is not just another election. This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and weÃ¢ÂÂve been through too much to turn back now. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!

THE PRESIDENT: We have come too far to abandon the change we fought for these past few years. We have to move forward, to the future we imagined in 2008, where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the choice in this election, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂm running for a second term as President of the United States. (Applause.)

Governor Romney is a patriotic American who has raised a wonderful family, and he has much to be proud of. HeÃ¢ÂÂs run a large financial firm, and heÃ¢ÂÂs run a state. But I think he has drawn the wrong lessons from those experiences. He sincerely believes that if CEOs and wealthy investors like him make money, the rest of us will automatically prosper as well.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: When a woman in Iowa shared the story of her financial struggles, he responded with economic theory. He told her, Ã¢ÂÂour productivity equals our income.Ã¢ÂÂ Well, let me tell you something. The problem with our economy isnÃ¢ÂÂt that the American people arenÃ¢ÂÂt productive enough -- youÃ¢ÂÂve been working harder than ever. (Applause.) The challenge we face right now -- the challenge we faced for over a decade is that harder work hasnÃ¢ÂÂt led to higher incomes. ItÃ¢ÂÂs that bigger profits havenÃ¢ÂÂt led to better jobs. (Applause.)

Governor Romney doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem to get that. He doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem to understand that maximizing profits by whatever means necessary -- whether through layoffs or outsourcing or tax avoidance or union-busting -- might not always be good for the average American or for the American economy.

Why else would he want to spend trillions more on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Why else would he propose cutting his own taxes while raising them on 18 million working families? Why else would he want to slash the investments that have always helped the economy grow, but at the same time, stop regulating the reckless behavior on Wall Street that helped the economy crash?

Somehow, he and his friends in Congress think that the same bad ideas will lead to a different result. Or theyÃ¢ÂÂre just hoping you wonÃ¢ÂÂt remember what happened the last time we tried it their way.

Well, Ohio, IÃ¢ÂÂm here to say that we were there, we remember, and we are not going back. We are moving this country forward. (Applause.)

Look, we want businesses to succeed. We want entrepreneurs and investors rewarded when they take risks, when they create jobs and grow our economy. But the true measure of our prosperity is more than just a running tally of every balance sheet and quarterly profit report. I donÃ¢ÂÂt care how many ways you try to explain it: Corporations arenÃ¢ÂÂt people. People are people. (Applause.)

We measure prosperity not just by our total GDP; not just by how many billionaires we produce, but how well the typical family is doing -- whether they can go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them.

And we understand that in this country, people succeed when they have a chance to get a decent education and learn new skills -- and, by the way, so do the businesses that hire them or the companies that they start. (Applause.)

We know that our economy grows when we support research into medical breakthroughs and new technologies that lead to the next Internet app or life-saving drug.

We know that our country is stronger when we can count on affordable health insurance and Medicare and Social Security. (Applause.) When we protect our kids from toxic dumping and mercury pollution. When there are rules to make sure we arenÃ¢ÂÂt taken advantage of by credit card companies and mortgage lenders and financial institutions. And we know these rules arenÃ¢ÂÂt just good for seniors, or kids, or consumers -- they're good for business, too. They're part of what makes the market work.

Look, we donÃ¢ÂÂt expect government to solve all our problems, and it shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt try. I learned from my mom that no education policy can take the place of a parentÃ¢ÂÂs love and affection. (Applause.) As a young man, I worked with a group of Catholic churches who taught me that no poverty program can make as much of a difference as the kindness and commitment of a caring soul. (Applause.) Not every regulation is smart. Not every tax dollar is spent wisely. Not every person can be helped who refuses to help themselves.

But thatÃ¢ÂÂs not an excuse to tell the vast majority of responsible, hardworking Americans, Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre on your own.Ã¢ÂÂ That unless youÃ¢ÂÂre lucky enough to have parents who can lend you money, you may not be able to go to college. That even if you pay your premiums every month, youÃ¢ÂÂre out of luck if an insurance company decides to drop your coverage when you need it most.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not how we built America. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not who we are. We built this country together. (Applause.) We built this country together.

We built railroads and highways; the Hoover Dam, the Golden Gate Bridge -- together. We sent my grandfatherÃ¢ÂÂs generation to college on the GI Bill -- together. We instituted a minimum wage and worker safety laws -- together. Together, we touched the surface of the moon, unlocked the mystery of the atom, connected the world through our own science and imagination. We did these things together -- not because they benefited any particular individual or group, but because they made us all richer. Because they gave us all opportunity. Because they moved us forward together -- as one people, as one nation. (Applause.)

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the true lesson of our past, Ohio. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the right vision for our future. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂm running for President. (Applause.)

IÃ¢ÂÂm running to make sure that by the end of the decade, more of our citizens hold a college degree than any other nation on Earth. (Applause.) I want to help our schools hire and reward the best teachers, especially in math and science. (Applause.) I want to give two million more Americans the chance to go to community colleges and learn the skills that local businesses are looking for right now. In the 21st century, higher education canÃ¢ÂÂt be a luxury -- it is an economic imperative that every American should be able to afford. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the choice in this election. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂm running for President. (Applause.)

IÃ¢ÂÂm running to make sure the next generation of high-tech manufacturing takes root in places like Columbus and Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Richmond. I want to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs and profits overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the choice in this election. (Applause.)

IÃ¢ÂÂm running so that we can keep moving towards a future where we control our own energy. Our dependence on foreign oil is at its lowest point in 16 years. (Applause.) By the middle of the next decade, our cars will average nearly 55 miles per gallon. Thousands of Americans have jobs, right now, because the production of renewal energy in this country has nearly doubled in just three years. (Applause.)

So now is not the time to cut these investments to pay for another $4 billion giveaway to the oil companies. Now is the time to end the subsidies for an industry thatÃ¢ÂÂs rarely been more profitable. (Applause.) LetÃ¢ÂÂs double down on a clean energy future thatÃ¢ÂÂs never been more promising -- for our economy, and for our security, and for the safety of our planet. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂm running for President. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the choice in this election, Ohio. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!

THE PRESIDENT: For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. (Applause.) Osama bin Laden is no longer a threat to this country. (Applause.) Al Qaeda is on the path to defeat. And by 2014, the war in Afghanistan will be over. (Applause.)

America is safer and more respected because of the courage and selflessness of the United States Armed Forces. (Applause.) And as long as IÃ¢ÂÂm Commander-in-Chief, this country will care for our veterans and serve our veterans as well as theyÃ¢ÂÂve served us -- (applause) -- because nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home. (Applause.)

My opponent said it was Ã¢ÂÂtragicÃ¢ÂÂ to end the war in Iraq. He said he wonÃ¢ÂÂt set a timeline for ending the war in Afghanistan.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: I have, and I intend to keep it. (Applause.) After a decade of war thatÃ¢ÂÂs cost us thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars, the nation we need to build is our own. (Applause.) I will use half of what weÃ¢ÂÂre no longer spending on war to pay down the deficit, and the other half to repair our roads and our bridges, our runways and our wireless networks. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the choice in this election -- to rebuild America. (Applause.)

IÃ¢ÂÂm running to pay down our debt in a way thatÃ¢ÂÂs balanced and responsible. After inheriting a $1 trillion deficit, I signed $2 trillion of spending cuts into law. And now I want to finish the job by streamlining government and cutting more waste, and reforming our tax code so that it is simpler and fairer, and asks the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more. (Applause.)

My opponent wonÃ¢ÂÂt tell us how heÃ¢ÂÂd pay for his new,

$5 trillion tax cut -- a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: But we know the bill for that tax cut will either be passed on to our children, or it will be paid for by a whole lot of ordinary Americans. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we know. And I refuse to let that happen again. (Applause.)

I refuse to pay for another millionaireÃ¢ÂÂs tax cut by eliminating medical research projects into things like cancer and AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease. I refuse to pay for another tax cut by kicking children off of Head Start programs; or asking students to pay more for college; or eliminating health insurance for millions of poor and elderly and disabled Americans on Medicaid. (Applause.)

And as long as IÃ¢ÂÂm President of the United States, I will never allow Medicare to be turned into a voucher that would end the program as we know it. (Applause.) We will not go back to the days when our citizens spent their golden years at the mercy of private insurance companies. We will reform Medicare -- not by shifting the cost of care to seniors, but by reducing the spending that isnÃ¢ÂÂt making people healthier. (Applause.) ThatÃ¢ÂÂs whatÃ¢ÂÂs at stake in this election. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs whatÃ¢ÂÂs at stake, Ohio.

On issue after issue, we canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to spend the next four years going backward. America doesnÃ¢ÂÂt need to refight the battles we just had over Wall Street reform and health care reform. On health care reform, here is what I know: Allowing 2.5 million young people to stay on their parentsÃ¢ÂÂ health insurance plan -- that was the right thing to do. (Applause.) Cutting prescription drug costs for seniors -- that was the right thing to do. (Applause.) I will not go back to the days when insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, or deny you coverage, or charge women differently from men. WeÃ¢ÂÂre not going back there. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going forward. (Applause.)

We donÃ¢ÂÂt need another political fight about ending a womanÃ¢ÂÂs right to choose, or getting rid of Planned Parenthood -- (applause) -- or taking away access to affordable birth control. I want women to control their own health choices, just like I want my daughters to have the same opportunities as your sons. (Applause.) We are not turning back the clock. We are moving forward. (Applause.)

WeÃ¢ÂÂre not returning to the days when you could be kicked out of the United States military just because of who you are or who you love. (Applause.) That would be wrong for our national security, and it would be a betrayal of our values.

This should be the last election where multimillion-dollar donations speak louder than the voices of ordinary citizens. (Applause.) We need more checks on lobbyists and special interests, not less.

WeÃ¢ÂÂre not going to eliminate the EPA. WeÃ¢ÂÂre not going to roll back the bargaining rights that generations of workers fought for. (Applause.) ItÃ¢ÂÂs time to stop denying citizenship to responsible young people just because theyÃ¢ÂÂre the children of undocumented immigrants. (Applause.) This country is at its best when we harness the God-given talents of every individual; when we hear every voice; when we come together as one American family, striving for the same dream.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what weÃ¢ÂÂre fighting for. That's what we're fighting for, Ohio. A bold America. A competitive America. A generous America. A forward-looking America, where everybody has a chance to make of their life what they will. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what made us the envy of the world. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what makes us great. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why IÃ¢ÂÂm running again for President of the United States. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!

THE PRESIDENT: And that is why I need your help. Ohio, this election will be even closer than the last. Too many of our friends, too many of our neighbors are still hurting because of this crisis. I've heard from too many people wondering why they haven't been able to get one of the jobs that have been created; why their home is still under water; why their family hasn't yet been touched by the recovery.

The other side won't be offering these Americans a real answer to these questions. They won't offer a better vision or a new set of ideas. But they will be spending more money than we've ever seen before on negative ads, on TV, on radio, in the mail, on the Internet -- ads that exploit people's frustrations for my opponent's political gain. Over and over again, they will tell you that America is down and out, and they'll tell you who to blame, and ask if youÃ¢ÂÂre better off than you were before the worst crisis in our lifetime.

WeÃ¢ÂÂve seen that play before. But you know what? The real question -- the question that will actually make a difference in your life and in the lives of your children -- is not just about how weÃ¢ÂÂre doing today. ItÃ¢ÂÂs about how weÃ¢ÂÂll be doing tomorrow.

Will we better off if more Americans get a better education? ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the question. Will we better off if we depend less on foreign oil and more on our own ingenuity? That's the question. (Applause.) Will we better off if we start doing some nation-building right here at home? That's the question. Will we be better off if we bring down our deficit without gutting the very things we need to grow? When we look back four years from now, or ten years from now, or twenty years from now, wonÃ¢ÂÂt we be better off if we have the courage to keep moving forward? (Applause.)

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the question in this election. That's the question in this election. And the outcome is entirely up to you. Now, sure, weÃ¢ÂÂll have to contend with even more negative ads, with even more cynicism and nastiness, and sometimes just plain foolishness. There will be more of that than we saw in the last campaign.

But if there is one thing that we learned in 2008, itÃ¢ÂÂs that nothing is more powerful than millions of voices calling for change. (Applause.) When enough of you knock on doors, when you pick up phones, when you talk to your friends, when you decide that itÃ¢ÂÂs time for change to happen, guess what? Change happens. Change comes to America. (Applause.)

And thatÃ¢ÂÂs the spirit we need again. If people ask you what this campaign is about, you tell them itÃ¢ÂÂs still about hope. You tell them itÃ¢ÂÂs still about change. You tell them itÃ¢ÂÂs still about ordinary people who believe that in the face of great odds, we can make a difference in the life of this country. (Applause.)

Because I still believe, Ohio. I still believe that we are not as divided as our politics suggest. I still believe that we have more in common than the pundits tell us; that we're not Democrats or Republicans, but Americans first and foremost. (Applause.) I still believe in you, and IÃ¢ÂÂm asking you to keep believing in me. (Applause.) I told you in 2008 that I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt a perfect man, and I would never be a perfect President. But I promised that I would always tell you what I thought. I would always tell you where I stood. And I would wake up every single day fighting for you as hard as I know how. (Applause.)

And I have that kept that promise. I have kept that promise, Ohio. And I will keep it so long as I have the honor of being your President. So if youÃ¢ÂÂre willing to stick with me, if you're willing to fight with me, and press on with me; if youÃ¢ÂÂre willing to work even harder in this election than you did in the last election, I guarantee you -- we will move this country forward. (Applause.)

We will finish what we started. We are still fired up. We are still ready to go. And we are going to remind the world once more just why it is that the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. (Applause.)

Thank you, God bless you. God bless the United States of America.

499	"July 25, 2010 Ã¢ÂÂ -- TAPPER: Secretary Geithner thanks for joining us. Good to see you.

So, the administration has had a number of successes after big battles, stimulus, health care legislation, new rules for Wall Street, but you have a big battle coming when it comes to the Bush tax cuts.

If they remain in place, as Republicans want, it will cost three trillion dollars every ten years. The administration has said it wants to keep the ones for people who make under $200,000 a year, individuals and $250,000 for couples.

That will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years.

Ben Bernanke the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that with the economic outlook unusually uncertain, extending the Bush tax cuts would have a stimulative effect on the economy. Is he right?

GEITHNER: I don't think it should be a battle, Jake. You know, what the President's proposing to do is to leave in place, to extend tax cuts that go to more than 95 percent of working Americans and to leave in place tax cuts that are very important to incent businesses to hire new pe -- new employees and to invest in expanding output.

We think that's a -- the -- it's a very strong package. We think it's the right package. We think it's fair. We think it's responsible.

Now, we also think it's responsible to let the tax cuts expire that just go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans. We think that's the responsible thing to do because we need to make sure we can show the world that they're willing as a country now to start to make some progress bringing down our long -- our long-term deficits.

TAPPER: Don't you think it will slow economic growth?

GEITHNER: No. Just letting those tax cuts that only go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans in the country expire. I do not believe it will have a negative effect on growth.

TAPPER: This package that you're talking about pushing in Congress to -- to save the Bush tax cuts for people under $200,000 individuals and 250 for couples --

GEITHNER: And in fact, we go beyond that. Because you know, we're proposing to extend the make or pay tax cut which also goes to 95 percent of working Americans. And a set of very important business tax cuts targeted for small businesses themselves, expensing, zero capital gains rate for investment in small businesses. These things, we think, are very helpful, very powerful.

TAPPER: And when are you talking about pushing that into Congress?

GEITHNER: Congress is on the verge of what we hope will be enactment of a very strong package of tax measures for small businesses and ways to help them get credit so they can expand.

TAPPER: So, before the election?

GEITHNER: Oh, absolutely.

TAPPER: A number of Senate democrats, moderate Senate democrats have said that they oppose repealing or allowing to expire the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans that they think that would be harmful to growth.

Are you guys going to have the votes to get through the package you want which is focused more on middle and lower income America?

GEITHNER: Oh absolutely. I believe we will.

TAPPER: Some in the administration and internal discussions are talking about maybe just keeping all the Bush tax cuts for a year or two. Those aren't -- that's not going to happen?

GEITHNER: I don't believe it should and I don't believe it will. Again, because what the president's proposed is to make sure we're leaving them in place for the people that need the most and can make the most difference in helping make sure this economy comes back. That we heal the damage caused by this crisis.

TAPPER: Job creation has not gone as well as you hoped. What more can you do? I know there's this small business lending initiative. What more can you do given the lack of appetite on Capitol Hill for any spending programs? Any more stimulus?

GEITHNER: Well you know, the President's proposed a very strong package of help for small businesses which you just referred to. He'd support giving more support to states so they can keep teachers in the classroom.

TAPPER: Fifty billion dollars in emergency spending but the Congress has not acted on that.

GEITHNER: They haven't yet, but we can (inaudible) case for doing it. They're going to, we're going to keep at that. But right now, the best thing the government can do in addition to those things, is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again.

Now, we've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector. That's pretty good.

TAPPER: By the private sector.

GEITHNER: Pretty good this early in a recession.

TAPPER: Although you count in the public sector with the layoffs and the census jobs.

GEITHNER: But only because of census. But you know, what matters is -- is the private sector starting to hire people, add back hours and that's what's critical.

And you're seeing that happen now. Now we want it -- we want to see it happen at a faster pace. But I think most people understand that you know, this was a deep crisis. The scars ran very deep. Devastating damage. It's going to take time to repair that damage, take time to grow out of this. But we're making progress.

TAPPER: In 2009 when President Obama talked about unemployment insurance extensions he talked about how it was paid for. This time, it was not paid for, the $34 billion in unemployment insurance extensions became added to the national debt.

Republicans on Capitol Hill argued that they wanted to pay for it and they supported it but they just wanted it offset by spending cuts.

Given the fact that we're going to be -- we're going to have unemployment for the foreseeable future, high unemployment. Isn't it the fiscally responsible thing to do to not treat this as emergency spending but treat this as something we know is coming down the pike so we're not just laying this burden on our future generations?

GEITHNER: I don't think so. In a crisis that was this bad and a recession that was that deep. With this amount of lasting damage, scars from recovery, it's appropriate to treat these things as emergencies."	0

501	"March 27, 2011 Ã¢ÂÂ -- AMANPOUR: This week -- furious mobs kill more western civiliansin Afghanistan. And as the death toll mounts, the Florida pastor whostarted it by burning a Koran says that he has no regrets.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TERRY JONES: We do not feel responsible, no.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: Our correspondent is with American soldiers in thedeadliest firefight against the Taliban in months.

Then in Libya, despite U.S. and NATO bombing runs meant to savethem, rebels are in retreat from Gadhafi's forces. Is America in abattle it can't win? Three wars and billions of dollars later, we'lldiscuss all of this with the president's former national securityadviser in his first interview since leaving the White House.

Also, who will pay for it all?

The jobs picture is getting brighter. But could rising prices,revolution, and a nuclear disaster kill the recovery? And as partisanbickering meets the bloated budget, will the government shut downlater this week?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. MIKE PENCE R-IND.: I say, shut it down.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: Two top senators join us for a This Week debate.

ANNOUNCER: Live from the Newseum in Washington, This Week startsright now.

AMANPOUR: Welcome to the program. Right now, the Middle East isfalling further into chaos, violence and uncertainty as the UnitedStates grapples with fresh challenges in two of its three wars.President Obama, who ran as the anti-war candidate, now finds himselfstruggling to defend new American military action overseas, while therapidly changing situations in Libya, Afghanistan, and across theMiddle East pose new threats to U.S. security and credibility.

I'll be talking to my colleagues Mike Boettcher and Nick Schifrinin Afghanistan, and Jeffrey Kaufman and Alex Marquardt on the frontlines in Libya.

Let's turn first to Afghanistan, where a firefight along thePakistan border brought one of the deadliest days for American troopsin months, and where the battle for hearts and minds may have beenvirtually erased overnight at the hands of a fringe pastor in Florida.

After months of threatening to burn a copy of the Koran, PastorTerry Jones and his handful of followers finally did just that. Thisdeliberately provocative act received little media attention here inthe United States, but it did spread like wildfire online. And withindays, protests in Afghanistan turned deadly.

ABC's Mike Boettcher is embedded with the 101st AirborneDivision. Mike was the lone reporter on that bloody six-day offensivealong the border.

Mike, how bad was that?

MIKE BOETTCHER, ABC CORRESPONDENT: In 30 years of covering war,I have never seen such withering fire. And soldiers who have beendeployed four or five times will tell you the same thing.

A high price was paid. Six U.S. soldiers were killed. Six werewounded. Two Afghan national army were killed. And seven Afghanswere wounded in this battle, and the battle continues as we speak,right now.

This is a significant engagement because it marks a turning pointor a change in strategy along the Pakistan border where bases havebeen closed in recent months, small combat outposts. The U.S. nowsays that they're taking a more mobile strategy, going to areas theyhaven't been before, and going after the Taliban. They're going tocarry this through, through the spring and summer and expect to seevery heavy fighting in the east part of the country in the comingyear. Christiane?

AMANPOUR: Meantime, in cities across Afghanistan today, morescenes of rage and violence in response to that Florida pastor'sdecision to burn a Koran. The situation does present a grave newproblem for the United States. And ABC's Nick Schifrin joins me nowfrom Kabul.

Nick, today, General Petraeus had to come out and specificallycondemn the burning of that Koran. How bad is it there?

NICK SCHIFRIN, ABC CORRESPONDENT: Well, we've seen threeprotests three days in a row now, massive protests, 8,000 miles awayfrom that Koran-burning. Today thousands of Afghans in the streets ofsouthern Afghanistan and eastern Afghanistan, they were burning U.S.flags and chanting ""death to President Obama.""

Now David Petraeus came out with that statement today, but thereis one good piece of news. The Afghan police did not shoot into thecrowds like they did yesterday. On Friday, they were supposed to bethe first line of defense around a U.N. building where seven U.N.workers were killed. They were not able to keep those workers -- keepthose protesters out of that U.N. building.

And U.S. officials are deeply concerned about that, because theplace where that happened, Mazar-i-Sharif, is the first city that issupposed to transfer to Afghan control, to transfer to Afghan policecontrol in three months.

And U.S. and U.N. officials are worried that this incident is asign that the police aren't ready to take control -- Christiane. AMANPOUR: Nick, thank you. And obviously we'll keep monitoringthat situation.

And now we turn to Libya. America's newest war is entering itsthird week of bombing, and still there is no sign that Colonel Gadhafiis stepping down. And now more bad news for the makeshift rebelforces. NATO warplanes seem to have mistakenly bombed one of theirconvoys. Another blow in a week where they've seen most of theirgains against Gadhafi wiped out.

Just Monday, the rebels were within striking distance ofcapturing Gadhafi's home town of Sirt. And they had the capitalTripoli in their sites. But by week's end, they were beating a hastyretreat with Gadhafi forces once again in control of the long stretchof coastline.

Our reporters in Libya have been tracking all of this. JeffreyKaufman just arrived in Tripoli, and Alex Marquardt joins us from therebel bastion of Benghazi. Let's start with Jeffrey.

Jeffrey, in Tripoli, any signs of the tension or that maybeGadhafi is on his last few days?

JEFFREY KAUFMAN, ABC CORRESPONDENT: Well, actually, just momentsago we heard a NATO warplane flying above us. We didn't hear anybombs dropping. But, you know, it's actually remarkably normal here.You can see the traffic behind me on the highway.

As we came in, we saw a lot of military checkpoints, long linesfor gasoline, a lot of shops closed. But the tension is not palpableat this point. The rebels are clearly on the retreat. Really, whatwe're seeing now in Libya is a divided country, almost two countries:the rebel-held east and the Gadhafi-held west.

And neither one seems to have the strength right now to unseatthe other. Certainly the rebels aren't organized enough, mannedenough, or skilled enough to come to Tripoli. And Gadhafi, it seems,the coalition will not let him go further east and retake thosevaluable oil fields in those areas.

So right now the word to describe this revolution, weeks into it,is stalemate -- Christiane.

AMANPOUR: Jeffrey, thank you. You mentioned stalemate and alsodivided country. And joining me now from the rebel-held city ofBenghazi is ABC's Alex Marquardt.

Alex, how are these rebels dealing with being unable to reallycapitalize on all of the help the no-fly zone is giving them?

ALEX MARQUARDT, ABC CORRESPONDENT: Christiane, they're not ableto capitalize because they are outmanned, they are outgunned, and theyare not able to organize. They don't have the weapons to faceGadhafi's superior firepower. So they're forced to beat a retreat.

They don't have any sort of leadership. So when they retreat,they do so in a disorganized fashion, very quickly, no one showingthem how to hold the line, how to retreat.

So we're seeing now glimmers of hope that they'll be able toorganize. Experienced officers on the frontlines trying to corralthese groups into units, keeping people back without any sort oftraining.

And for the first time on the frontlines on Friday we saw thegeneral who is technically in charge of these forces, General AbdelFattah Yunis, welcomed with a hero's welcome. So signs that there issome leadership coming to the frontlines that is so desperately neededby these rebels.

AMANPOUR: Alex, thank you so much.

Rarely has a president faced a foreign policy puzzle thiscomplex. President Obama, of course, came into office pledging torepair America's relationship with the Muslim world. Now thatrelationship is tested like never before. Joining me to discuss thepath forward, the president's former national security adviser,General Jim Jones. He's now a senior fellow at the Bipartisan PolicyCenter.

Thank you for joining us.

JONES: Thank you, Christiane. Good to be here.

AMANPOUR: Let's first talk about Afghanistan, since that seemsto be a real crisis again at the moment. This pastor who burned theKoran, is unrepentant. Do you think despite the freedoms envisionedand expressed specifically in the American Constitution, he should nothave burned that Koran?

JONES: Oh, I don't think he should have done that at all. Ithink it's extremely irresponsible, and look at what it has led to.

AMANPOUR: You also heard Mike Boettcher's report, a fiercefirefight along the Pakistani border, one of the worst that theAmericans had been involved in. Right now, do you think the UnitedStates forces can pull down significantly in July?

JONES: Well, I think that there can be and there will be somereduction of force in keeping with the agreement made at Portugal atthe NATO summit in December to target 2014 as, in President Karzai'sown words at the London Conference, ""This is when I want to be able tocontrol my entire country.""

AMANPOUR: But can it be done responsibly, if you'd like?

JONES: Yes, I think so. I think it can be done responsibly.And we'll have to see what it looks like. A lot of it hinges on whathappens on the other side of the border with our friends, the -- ourneighbors the Pakistanis.

If Pakistan turns to what some of us think they should have donemore effectively for a long period of time now, attacking and removingthose safe havens that cause us so much difficulties, and if we canget some sort of coordination with their forces, then I think you canin fact...

AMANPOUR: You say if. You don't seem convinced that they'replaying their part.

JONES: Well, I don't -- I'm not convinced. I think there wassome good progress made in the Swat Valley and in North Waziristan ayear or so ago. But it hasn't been sustained. There still seems tobe that reluctance to engage comprehensively and buy into an overallplan that would, I think, really help Pakistan in the long term.

AMANPOUR: All right. General Jones, stay with us because upnext we will talk about Libya. Will Libya become Obama's Iraq, assome are now suggesting? And it's a question you'll hear more andmore in the coming days. I will ask General Jones if he sees an endin sight.

ROBERT GATES, DEFENSE SECRETARY: There will be no American bootson the ground in Libya. Deposing the Gadhafi regime, as welcome asthat eventuality would be, is not part of the military mission.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: Defense Secretary Robert Gates testifying on CapitolHill Thursday. He is on the record saying that stopping the violencein Libya is not a vital national interest of the United States. ButAmerica is in the game now. And the big questions, for how long? Andto what end? Let's bring back retired General Jim Jones, who wasPresident Obama's first national security adviser.

Welcome back again. On Libya, Secretary Gates has said on thisprogram and on several last week, that it was not in the vitalinterest of the United States. Do you agree?

JONES: I agree with that.

AMANPOUR: You agree that it's not in the vital interest?

JONES: I agree that it's not a vital interest in the sense thatit affects the security -- the vital security of the nation. But weare part of an alliance. We are one of the global leaders, if not theglobal leader. And we have to do -- it is in the vital interest --more in the vital interest of Europeans, when you consider the effectsof massive immigration, the effects of terror, the effects of the oilmarket.

AMANPOUR: So the United States is now in it. You can call itwhat you want. But it's a third armed conflict.

JONES: We're a part of it. We are transitioning to a supportingpart, only the United States could have gotten there as quickly as itdid.

AMANPOUR: The United States is making a great fanfare about nowgiving over to NATO. But you were a former SACEUR, a former NATOcommander. NATO, to all intents and purposes, is an Americanorganization. It's run by an American commander. The chain ofcommand is American. The biggest command and control and resourcesare American. This is still an American-led operation, right?"	0

Asked about fair pay for women during the second presidential debate, President Barack Obama was quick to bring up the first piece of legislation he signed into law -- the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.



Audience member Katherine Fenton asked Obama, ""In what new ways to you intend to rectify the inequalities in the workplace, specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn?""



Obama talked about being raised by a single mom who put herself through school and of his grandmother, who worked her way up from a bank secretary to a vice president but ""hit the glass ceiling.""



""She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didn't complain. That's not what you did in that generation,"" he said at the debate at Hofstra University on Oct. 16, 2012. ""And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lilly Ledbetter bill.""



Romney responded by saying at one point he had more women in senior leadership positions than any other governor and that he wanted to help more women find jobs.



Obama jumped in, saying, ""Katherine, I just want to point out that when Gov. Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, Ã¢ÂÂI'll get back to you.Ã¢ÂÂ And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.""



Did Romney and his campaign really refuse to say whether he supported the law? Sort of.



The law, which Obama signed on Jan. 29, 2009, made it easier for workers to pursue wage discrimination claims but received little Republican support in Congress. It updated 1960s civil rights and age discrimination laws to reset the statute of limitations on such claims with each new paycheck. In 2007, the Supreme Court had ruled in Ledbetter vs. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. that the 180-day statute of limitations started from the day an employer made the decision to discriminate Ã¢ÂÂ making it harder for employees who claimed such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay.



What did Romney have to say about it? For a previous fact-check in May, the Obama campaign directed us to a couple media reports.



In an April 2012 conference call covered by a Washington Post blogger, a Huffington Post reporter asked an unnamed Romney adviser whether Romney supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act. The adviser responded, ""Sam (Stein), weÃ¢ÂÂll get back to you on that.""



Later, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul clarified in an email, ""He supports pay equity and is not looking to change current law.""



The second piece the Obama campaign showed us was a Romney interview by Diane Sawyer of ABC News. Sawyer asked Romney, "" If you were president Ã¢ÂÂ you had been president Ã¢ÂÂ would you have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Law?""



RomneyÃ¢ÂÂs response:

Romney: ""It's certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing. I wasn't there three years ago Ã¢ÂÂ""

Sawyer: ""But would you have signed it?""

Romney: ""... I'm not going to go back and look at all the prior laws and say had I been there which ones would I have supported and signed, but I certainly support equal pay for women and Ã¢ÂÂ and have no intention of changing that law, don't think there's a reason to.""

Here, Romney did refuse to say whether he would have signed the bill into law. But he also said he has ""no intention of changing that law.""

Our ruling



Obama said that when asked whether he would have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act into law, Romney's campaign said, ""I'll get back to you."" His point was that the campaign was dodging the question.



Indeed, a Romney adviser did say earlier this year that he would ""get back"" to a reporter about whether he supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act. A spokeswoman then said he would not change it, and Romney later said he ""certainly support(s) equal pay for women,"" and has ""no intention of changing that law.""



So Obama is correct about the initial statement, but Romney later clarified by saying he wouldn't change the law. We rate Obama's claim Mostly True.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this item said the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision made it ""impossible for employees who learned of such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay."" In fact, the court declined to address the question of whether employees who learned of discrimination after the statute of limitations expired would be protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."	0
503	"WASHINGTON ÃÂ The Bush administration on Saturday formally proposed a vast bailout of financial institutions in the United States, requesting unfettered authority for the Treasury Department to buy up to $700 billion in distressed mortgage-related assets from the private firms.

The proposal, not quite three pages long, was stunning for its stark simplicity. It would raise the national debt ceiling to $11.3 trillion. And it would place no restrictions on the administration other than requiring semiannual reports to Congress, granting the Treasury secretary unprecedented power to buy and resell mortgage debt.

Ã¢ÂÂThis is a big package, because it was a big problem,Ã¢ÂÂ President Bush said Saturday at a White House news conference, after meeting with President ÃÂlvaro Uribe of Colombia. Ã¢ÂÂI will tell our citizens and continue to remind them that the risk of doing nothing far outweighs the risk of the package, and that, over time, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to get a lot of the money back.Ã¢ÂÂ

After a week of stomach-flipping turmoil in the financial system, and with officials still on edge about how global markets will respond, the delivery of the administrationÃ¢ÂÂs plan set the stage for a four-day brawl in Congress. Democratic leaders have pledged to approve a bill but say it must also include tangible help for ordinary Americans in the form of an economic stimulus package."	0
